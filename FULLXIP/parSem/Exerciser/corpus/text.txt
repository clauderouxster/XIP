Robust parsing provides mechanisms for identifying major syntactic structures and major functional relations between words on large collections of unrestricted documents (ex: Web pages, newspapers, scientific literature, encyclopedias).
 Xerox Incremental Parsing (XIP) is a formalism that smoothly integrates a number of description mechanisms for shallow and deep robust parsing, ranging from part-of-speech disambiguation, entity recognition and chunking to dependency grammars and extra-sentencial processing. 
XIP grammars have been developed for a number of languages, including French, English and some others are being developed outside Xerox (Japanese, Chinese, German, Czech).
 Major applications include contextual entity recognition, lexical and structural disambiguation, coreference resolution and more globally knowledge extraction.
