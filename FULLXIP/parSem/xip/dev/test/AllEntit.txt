IRAQ


THE HERALD TRIBUNE

The United States and Britain presented a draft UN resolution Monday that calls for a full transfer of sovereignty to Iraq and an initial one-year mandate for the U.S.-led multinational military force, subject to the consent of the transitional government.
.
"The interim Iraqi government will assume total responsibility for its own sovereignty," the British ambassador, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, said before a closed-door Security Council session called to review the proposal. That government is to take office by June 30. The text drew mostly positive comments among ambassadors in the corridors outside the conference room, and was expected to lead fairly quickly to the passage of a resolution. But the timetable from now to June 30, when the United States has promised to hand over additional powers to Iraqis, remains tight, troubled and uncertain. "We are definitely running out of time," said Ambassador Abdallah Baali of Algeria, a council member. "There is no room for error. Not anymore."
.
The draft was presented hours before President George W. Bush - whose approval ratings have continued to decline, according to a new poll released Tuesday - was to launch a parallel effort aimed at reassuring Americans and drawing wider international backing for U.S. efforts in Iraq. A major prime-time speech Monday was to be the first of six such addresses planned. The United States has agreed to leave it largely to a special UN envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, to name leaders of an interim government, though a Brahimi spokesman said Monday that he might not make his May 31 deadline. Still, after weeks of intensive negotiations, the United States and Britain said they had achieved near-consensus among fellow Security Council members.
.
Even Ambassador Gunter Pleuger of Germany, whose country ardently opposed the Iraq war, called the draft text "a good basis for discussions" toward a resolution that will "make clear that we have a new start in Iraq."
.
The draft endorses plans for direct democratic elections to be held by the end of this year "if possible, and in no case later than 31 January 2005." The national assembly thereby elected will have responsibility for drafting a permanent constitution that will permit elections for a permanent government. The text also calls for lifting the arms embargo against Iraq. A broadly supported UN resolution would represent a significant mending of the bitter breach that developed over the U.S.-led march to war. It would also signal a striking new acceptance by the U.S. administration, as it struggles to retake the initiative after weeks of bruising setbacks, of the importance of the world body. The coming period could prove crucial to the administration's hopes for Iraq, and possibly also to Bush's prospects for re-election. His job approval rankings have declined steadily for weeks. A new CBS News poll found that 41 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing as president, down 3 percentage points in two weeks, and far below the 66 percent who approved a year earlier. Fifty-two percent disapproved of his overall performance in the latest poll, and 61 percent disapproved of his handling of Iraq. With worries over Iraq growing, 65 percent of those polled said that the United States was on the wrong track, equaling the highest number the poll has recorded since it began asking the question nearly 20 years ago. Republicans have not hidden their mounting concerns over Bush's poll numbers; no recent president with such ratings at this point in his presidency was re-elected. In an effort to retake the initiative, Bush planned in his speech to express a firm determination not to be chased from Iraq by the recent chaos, scandal and violence, but also an intent to shift growing levels of responsibility to Iraqis at the fastest reasonable pace, aides said. "We have two choices," said the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, foreshadowing the themes of Bush's speech. "We can work to build a free, democratic and peaceful Iraq, or we can let the terrorists prevail, but the terrorists will not prevail."
.
He said Bush would discuss U.S. efforts in Iraq in five areas: political moves, the elections planned for January, security, reconstruction and diplomatic efforts. For weeks, Britain has worked closely with the United States to write a broadly acceptable draft, and its ambassador to the United Nations emphasized that it envisions a full transfer of sovereignty.
.
"It underlines clearly that all sovereignty will be returned to the Iraqis, that the interim Iraqi government will assume total responsibility for its own sovereignty," Sir Emyr said.
.
McClellan also used the phrase "full sovereignty." But in a qualification that has left some confusion, he said it was only normal that, given its nonelected and temporary nature, the interim government would also have "limited authority."
.
The text reaffirms the UN authorization for the U.S.-led multinational force, but leaves it subject to review by the transitional government 12 months from the date a resolution is adopted. That force was created by a resolution in October. McClellan was asked Monday whether the multinational force would remain under U.S. command - a matter not specifically addressed in the text, but one on which the administration has indicated it will not budge. "Yes, that's what I expect," he said. The text states that the multinational force "shall have authority to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq including by preventing and deterring terrorism."
.
But the Iraqi government would have the power to ask the multinational force to leave. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Colin Powell, recently said as much, while adding that they felt certain no such request would be forthcoming. The British ambassador noted that the draft called for the multinational force to remain in Iraq after June 30 "with the consent, in consultation and in partnership" with the caretaker government. The United States would retain control of Iraqi police and security forces, though they would answer directly to Iraqi commanders. The draft also states that the interim government would control the Development Fund for Iraq, which includes Iraq's oil revenues. Brahimi, who has been working in Iraq since early this month to identify consensus leaders for the caretaker government, may be as much a week behind his May 31 deadline, his spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, told Bloomberg News.


THE GUARDIAN

George Bush tried last night to persuade an increasingly sceptical American public to rekindle its faith in his project for Iraq, promising he had a clear strategy for a handover of power.

The speech was delivered at a time when Mr Bush is facing approval ratings in the dangerous 40% range - the lowest of his presidency - and when some 64% of the public believe that he has no clear plan for bringing the situation in Iraq to a successful resolution.

Mr Bush tried to shake off those doubts yesterday, telling an audience at the army war college in Pennsylvania: "History is moving, and it will tend toward hope or tend toward tragedy. We will persevere and defeat this enemy and hold this hard-won ground for the realm of liberty."

Yesterday's address coincided with a proposal by Britain and America for a new United Nations resolution authorising the June 30 handover of power in Iraq and a US-led stabilisation force for Iraq.

The US-British resolution calls for a caretaker administration - unelected and appointed by the UN - which will take office by June 30 and govern until elections in approximately six months.

"The interim government of Iraq will assume the responsibility and authority for governing a sovereign Iraq," it says.

The resolution also authorises a US-led military force to stay in Iraq for at least a year. There is no clear timetable for the troops to leave.

Mr Bush lowered expectations by acknowledging that the coming five weeks will see a new eruption in violence, and that he may need to send more troops to Iraq.

"Iraq now faces a critical moment. As the Iraqi people move closer to governing themselves, the terrorists are likely to become more active and more brutal," he said.

He appeared determined to regain control of the domestic political terrain in the run-up to next November's election.

Mr Bush reached out to try to reverse the steady erosion of public support for the war and occupation of Iraq, pledging to demolish the notorious Abu Ghraib prison, where naked and humiliated Iraqis were photographed by American army guards.

He also set out what he called a five-point plan for a handover in Iraq, beginning with the transfer of power to an unelected Iraqi government on June 30, establishment of a US-led protection force, campaign for broader international support, and reconstruction including elections to be held in six months.

"Completing the five steps to Iraqi elected self-government will not be easy," Mr Bush said. "There is likely to be violence before the transfer of sovereignty and after the transfer of sovereignty."

Although Mr Bush was more expansive on his vision for Iraq than he has been in previous appearances, the substance of his plan was still woefully thin, and was seen largely as a concerted effort by Mr Bush to stop the erosion in support for his administration.

The Democratic challenger, John Kerry, has called on the White House to "turn words into action". However, last night's address is merely the first stage of what promises to be a dogged campaign by Mr Bush to turn around public opinion on the Iraq war.

White House aides have said he plans five more such speeches, one each week in the five weeks remaining until the June 30 handover date.

With time running out on Iraq - and Mr Bush just five months away from his own electoral test - the consequences of his decision to go to war are becoming even more stark.

With the death toll among US forces in Iraq now approaching 800, and the Abu Ghraib scandal producing almost daily revelations of fresh abuse, Mr Bush is facing a steady erosion of support.

More alarming for Mr Bush, he is losing support among his fellow Republicans. A poll posted on the Washington Post website last night attributed virtually all of his seven point decline in his approval rating to disaffected Republicans.

Mr Bush also has the burden of defending his defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, for a second time since the first pictures of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison surfaced three weeks ago.

In a blistering appearance on CBS television's 60 minutes on Sunday, General Anthony Zinni, a former commander of US forces in the Middle East, lashed out at Mr Rumsfeld for bungling the war, and said he should be held accountable.

"Somebody screwed up. And at this level and at this stage, it should be evident to everybody that they've screwed up," Mr Zinni said.

Mr Zinni, who served Mr Bush as an envoy to Israel and the Palestinians, broke ranks with the Administration before the war on Iraq. Like other military men, he has been severe in his criticism of Mr Rumsfeld's post-war planning, which called for a far smaller military force than the generals had wanted.

In his new book, Battle Ready, Mr Zinni says the Pentagon's civilian leadership betrayed "at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at worse, lying, incompetence and corruption" in the run-up to the war.


President George W. Bush on Monday said America's task in Iraq was the creation of a "free, representative government", adding: "The sooner this goal is achieved, the sooner our job will be done".

With sliding support for the US operation in Iraq putting his prospects of a second term in peril, Mr Bush set out what White House officials called a "clear strategy" for success.

"We will persevere, and defeat this enemy, and hold this hard-won ground for the realm of liberty," Mr Bush said.

Speaking on the day the US and UK put forward a draft United Nations resolution that would endorse an interim Iraqi government by the end of June, the president sought to dispel the growing impression of a listless US-led effort drifting out of control.

"There are five steps in our plan to help Iraq achieve democracy and freedom," Mr Bush said. "We will hand over authority to a sovereign Iraqi government, help establish security, continue rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure, encourage more international support and move toward a national election that will bring forward new leaders empowered by the Iraqi people."

In his prime-time speech to the Army War College in Pennsylvania, Mr Bush also announced the US would seek to demolish the Abu Ghraib prison, the scene of US torture of Iraqi detainees. The US will fund the construction of a new maximum security prison and, when that is completed and with the approval of the Iraqi government, "we will demolish the Abu Ghraib prison as a fitting symbol of Iraq's new beginning," Mr Bush said, stumbling over the pronunciation of the prison's name.

Mr Bush also emphasised the effort to improve the training of 260,000 Iraqi soldiers, police and security personnel. He said James Baker, former secretary of state, had successfully negotiated with several Iraqi creditor nations to forgive or reduce Saddam Hussein-era debts.

A CBS poll out on Monday showed 41 per cent of people surveyed approved of the job Mr Bush is doing as president, while 52 per cent disapproved - the lowest level of his presidency. A Washington Post-ABC News poll also showed Mr Bush's approval rating at the lowest level since he took office: a 47 per cent approval rating and just four out of 10 people approving of his handling of Iraq.

Mr Bush resisted the growing pressure to set a date for US troop withdrawal, instead saying that if US commanders need more soldiers, he would send them.

The numbers of people who favour troop withdrawal are also edging up - 40 per cent want the troops brought home, up 7 percentage points from last month - and the numbers supporting a stay-the-course strategy are slipping to 58 per cent from 66 per cent last month.

Just over a month before the handover of authority to what he insisted would be "full sovereignty" for the Iraqis, the president said the US aim in Iraq was "not only to defeat an enemy, it is to give strength to a friend - a free, representative government that serves its people and fights on their behalf. And the sooner this goal is achieved, the sooner our job will be done."



THE GUARDIAN
 Strong U.S. allies Australia and Japan praised Washington's latest moves on Iraq, with Canberra welcoming President Bush's pledge to stay in the country until it is democratic and Tokyo commending moves to seek a U.N. mandate for international troops there.

China urged the early establishment of a new Iraq with ``political sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,'' but said it too supported the U.S.-British draft resolution on post-occupation Iraq introduced Monday to the U.N. Security Council.

The resolution authorizes a U.S.-led multinational force to maintain security using ``all necessary measures.'' A key issue is whether sovereignty would really be restored after the June 30 handover of power.

Later Monday in a nationally televised address, Bush outlined his vision for Iraq following the planned handover of sovereignty to its people next month.

Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Liu Jianchao said his government will take part in U.N. consideration of the resolution ``with a positive and constructive attitude.'' He said Beijing had submitted a proposal outlining the Chinese position, including the need to improve the security of Iraq and restore peace at an early date.

Liu also said it was ``too premature'' to discuss whether China would contribute troops to the U.S.-led multinational force.

Australia's Prime Minister John Howard said he welcomed the Bush's pledge, adding that Australian troops would remain in Iraq even though opinion polls showed support for the deployment was slipping.

Australia sent 2,000 troops to take part in the invasion of Iraq and still has 850 military personnel in and around the country.

``This government has absolutely no intention of altering our position in relation to being part of the coalition in Iraq,'' Howard told parliament. ``We did not enter the coalition on the basis of opinion polls last year ... and we have absolutely no intention on the basis of opinion polls of altering our position at the present time.''

Japan welcomed the draft resolution and said it looked forward to cooperating with other countries to help rebuild Iraq. It made no mention of sending more troops.

``We hope a new resolution will be adopted to guarantee the reconstruction of Iraq by Iraqis,'' Hosoda said. ``We would like to work closely with other countries.''

Tokyo has long advocated more U.N. involvement in Iraq, which would lift public backing for Tokyo's dispatch of troops to the southern part of the country.

Japan has sent about 550 ground troops to Iraq and hundreds more air and naval forces to the region on a humanitarian mission to support the U.S.-led coalition.

The United States and Britain will need to negotiate with longtime critics of the Iraq war, such as France and Germany, on the resolution. Both Paris and Berlin are demanding a greater role for Iraq's interim government in security issues.

Japanese and South Korean media, meanwhile, said Bush's speech appeared aimed at bolstering support both at home and abroad after the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency said in an analysis piece that Bush's proposal to demolish Abu Ghraib prison could be interpreted as a ``political show'' and said it was unclear how much this would help repair impressions of U.S. soldiers.

Japan's public broadcaster said the plan to destroy the prison appeared to be part of an effort to improve America's image in the wake of the abuses of Iraqi inmates by U.S. soldiers at the facility.

Bush said the prison that was a symbol of death and torture under Saddam Hussein ``became a symbol of disgraceful conduct by a few American troops who dishonored our country and disregarded our values.''

He said the United States would pay to demolish the prison and build a new one.

South Korea already has 600 military medics and engineers in Iraq.

It decided earlier this year to send 3,600 South Korean troops to replace them as early as April, but the mission has been twice delayed and the government does not know when and where in Iraq they will be stationed. Many South Koreans oppose the plan because of growing violence there.

A group led by al-Qaida figure Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is claiming responsibility for the bomb attack that killed the head of the Iraqi governing council on Monday, according to a statement on the internet.

The Arabic-language statement, signed by Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad ("Monotheism and Jihad Group"), appeared on a website known for militant Islamic messages, though its authenticity could not be immediately verified.

The group said a Saudi named Abu Salama al-Hejazi carried out the bombing but did not indicate whether it was a suicide attack.

Izzedin Salim, who had taken over the rotating presidency of the governing council this month, died along with 10 other Iraqis while waiting in his car at a US checkpoint in Baghdad.

He was the second and most senior member of the US-appointed council to be assassinated and his death came at a critical time for Washington as it tries to improve security ahead of the transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis on June 30.

Praising the attack, the internet statement said: "Another lion from the Monotheism and Jihad Group has removed one of the rotten heads of those who betray God and sell their religion to the Americans and their allies.

"This operation announces to Muslims everywhere that the mojahedin, with their people in Iraq, are continuing and determined to lift the humiliation from our nation."

Other members of the Iraqi governing council could meet the same fate as Mr Salim, the statement added.

Brig Gen Mark Kimmitt, the chief military spokesman in Iraq, initially said that Monday's car bombing had the "classic hallmarks" of Zarqawi. He later suggested others might be to blame "because of methodology in some of the techniques that were used".

A group calling itself "Arab Resistance Group - al-Rashid Brigades", said on Monday that it killed Mr Salim.

Mr Zarqawi, a Jordanian who fought in Afghanistan, is wanted by the US for allegedly organising al-Qaida activities in Iraq and a $10m (£5.6m) reward for his capture is on offer.

His group is thought to have carried out the videotaped beheading of Nicholas Berg, the American civilian found dead in Iraq this month.

Zarqawi has previously claimed responsibility for two of the worst attacks in Iraq: the truck bombing of the UN headquarters last August and the car bombing in Najaf in the same month that killed Ayatollah Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim, a leading Shia figure, along with at least 82 others.

He has also claimed a suicide boat attack on Basra oil terminal which killed at least three US sailors on April 24 and a suicide car bomb outside the US headquarters in Baghdad which killed at least five Iraqis and a US soldier on May 6. 

THE GUARDIAN

The Bush administration tried to erase the recent shameful images of postwar Iraq last night by saying it would demolish Abu Ghraib prison, and discipline its commander.

In a statement from the White House, a few hours before George Bush's speech early today, the administration said that the demolition of the prison would symbolise a new beginning for Iraq. "Under Saddam Hussein, prisons like Abu Ghraib were symbols of death and torture. That same prison became a symbol of disgraceful conduct by a few American troops who dishonoured our country and disregarded our values," it said.

The directive concludes a debate on the future of the jail that had been raging since the first images appeared three weeks ago of cowering, naked Iraqi prisoners and their taunting American army guards.

Some had argued that Abu Ghraib, stained by its history under Saddam, should have been destroyed as soon as the war had ended. Now, it appears the Bush administration has come to that same view.

The statement said the US would help finance the construction of a new maximum security prison.

Inmates would be transferred to the new building. "Then, with the approval of the Iraqi government, we will demolish the Abu Ghraib prison as a fitting symbol of Iraq's new beginning."

The army announced that the general in charge of prisons when the abuse took place had been suspended, and removed from active duty.

Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, commander of the 800th military police brigade, was severely criticised in the army's investigation of the abuse. She was accused of failing to enforce standards among the soldiers under her command, and of rarely visiting the prison.

Gen Karpinski says she was overruled by higher-ranking officers on decisions to give tactical control of the prison to military intelligence. It remains unclear whether she will face criminal charges. A spokesman said the matter was "under review".


BIOGRAPHIES

TONY BLAIR
The son of a barrister and lecturer, Tony Blair was born in Edinburgh, but spent most of his childhood in Durham. At the age of 14 he returned to Edinburgh to finish his education at Fettes College. He studied law at Oxford, and went on to become a barrister himself.

After standing unsuccessfully for the Labour Party in a by-election, Blair went on to win the seat of Sedgefield in the 1983 General Election, aged 30.

Tony Blair made a speedy rise through the ranks, being promoted first to the shadow Treasury front bench in 1984. He subsequently served as a trade and industry spokesman, before being elected to the Shadow Cabinet in 1988 where he was made Shadow Secretary of State for Energy. In 1989 he moved to the employment brief.

After the 1992 election Labour's new leader, John Smith, promoted Blair to Shadow Home Secretary. It was in this post that Blair made famous his pledge that Labour would be tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.

John Smith died suddenly and unexpectedly in 1994, and in the subsequent leadership contest Tony Blair won a large majority of his party's support.

Blair immediately launched his campaign for the modernisation of the Labour Party, determined to complete the shift further towards the political centre which he saw as essential for victory. The debate over Clause 4 of the party's constitution was considered the crucial test of whether its members would commit to Blair's project. He removed the commitment to public ownership, and at this time coined the term New Labour.

The Labour Party won the 1997 General Election by a landslide, after 18 years in Opposition. At the age of 43 , Tony Blair became the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812.

The government began to implement a far-reaching programme of constitutional change, putting the question of devolution to referendums in Scotland and Wales.

An elected post of Mayor of London was established at the head of a new capital-wide authority, and all but 92 hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords in the first stage of its reform. The government has also implemented an investment programme of £42 billion in its priority areas of health and education.

Tony Blair was re-elected with another landslide majority in the 2001 General Election.

He is married to the barrister Cherie Booth QC, and they have four children. Their youngest, Leo, was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years.


JOHN MAJOR
John Major grew up in Brixton, and was educated at his local grammar school. He left school aged 16, and worked for Standard Chartered Bank before entering politics.

His political career began as a Conservative councillor in the London borough of Lambeth, and continued when he won the constituency of Huntingdon for the Conservatives in 1979, at the election which brought his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, to power.

He served in junior posts in the Home Office and the Whips Office and was Minister of State at the Department of Social Security before being appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 1987. There he served under the then Chancellor, Nigel Lawson.

In the summer of 1989 John Major became Foreign Secretary after Geoffrey Howe was moved from the Foreign Office to become Leader of the House of Commons and Deputy Prime Minister. Major became Chancellor of the Exchequer less than 100 days later when Nigel Lawson dramatically resigned. It was during Major's tenure at the Treasury that Britain joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990.

Thatcher's leadership at this time was under increasing pressure, and when she was challenged, John Major supported her in the leadership election of November 1990. When she stepped down, Major entered the contest himself, and with Thatcher's support he went on to beat Michael Heseltine and Douglas Hurd. He appointed both colleagues to his new Cabinet.

Once installed in the post of Prime Minister, Major had immediately to deal with an international crisis when Kuwait was invaded by Iraq. He led Britain successfully in the short war waged by the Allies against Saddam Hussein.

Early into his term, he announced the abolition of the poll tax which had caused so much controversy during Thatcher's final years in office. He also negotiated the Treaty on European Union at Maastricht, successfully winning a compromise that was acceptable, for a time, to the opposing wings of his party. Another personal initiative was the Citizens Charter, a code designed to introduce greater accountability to public services and to drive up standards of service.

Major's style was radically different from his predecessor. His unassuming and down-to-earth manner was initially considered a breath of fresh air, and a contrast to Margaret Thatcher's forcefulness.

Under Major the Conservatives went on to win the 1992 election with a workable majority, despite opinion polls which had predicted a hung parliament. However, over the next five years by-election losses and defections would whittle the governments majority down to single figures.

Perhaps the lowest point of John Major's premiership came soon after the election: the sterling crisis of September 1992 forced the pound to leave the ERM.

In 1995 Major made a bold move to reassert his authority within the Conservative Party when he resigned as leader (but not as Prime Minister) and submitted himself for re-election. In the subsequent contest he was challenged by the Welsh Secretary, John Redwood, whom he defeated.

Towards the end of his term, the economy was steadily emerging from recession. However, the Conservatives were defeated by Labour in the 1997 General Election, and John Major resigned as leader, having been Prime Minister for seven of the Conservatives eighteen consecutive years in power.

John Major has now retired from the House of Commons and in 1999 published his political memoirs.

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Winston Churchill was a politician, a soldier, an artist, and the 20th century's most famous and celebrated Prime Minister. His father was Lord Randolph Churchill, a Nineteenth Century Tory politician. He was educated at Harrow and at Sandhurst Royal Military College, after which he saw service in India and the Sudan, and acted off-duty as a war correspondent.

Churchill left the army in 1899 to take up politics, but first travelled to South Africa as a journalist. Although taken prisoner by the Boers, he made a daring escape and returned to safety despite the price on his head. His consequent fame no doubt aided his success as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Oldham in 1900.

Churchill was instinctively independent, willing to work with any side agreeing with his goals. Thus his stand against protectionism led him to join the Liberals in 1904. As President of the Board of Trade in Asquith's Liberal government he set up labour exchanges and unemployment insurance. As Home Secretary in 1910 he improved safety in the mines and prevented the employment of child miners, though disappointed radicals by deploying troops in Wales during a miners strike.

In 1911 he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, and ensured the Navy was ready for the outbreak of war in 1914. However, he was blamed for failed Dardanelles Campaign in 1915, and was demoted in the coalition government. He resigned his post and went to the Front.

In 1916 Lloyd George appointed him Minister for Munitions, in which post he developed the use of the tank in warfare. In 1918 he took responsibility for demobilisation.

He returned to the Conservative Party in the 1920s and spent 5 years as Stanley Baldwin's Chancellor, but again fell out with his party. Unpopular and ostracised for a decade, his warnings from the backbenches of Fascist imperialism went unheeded. His influence, it was said, had fallen to zero. However, Chamberlain's policy of appeasement failed, leading to his resignation and to the vindication of Churchill's position. George VI then asked Churchill to form a government in 1940 at the age of 65.

Asking the House of Commons for its confidence in his small War Cabinet, he said "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat." His evocative and stirring rhetoric, employed in many famed speeches, is seen as representing the spirit of wartime Britain, and was essential to raising national morale. He was renowned as a great character and a great leader but was a paradoxical man. Possessed of astonishing vision, he also made disastrous mistakes. Nevertheless, he brought Britain to victory against Germany on the 8th of May, 1945.

Following the Labour landslide in the post-war 1945 election, a surprised Churchill found himself leading the Conservative Opposition. He then served four years as a peacetime Prime Minister. The second Churchill administration did not realise his hopes of ending the Cold War. In contrast to the stark choices of the second world war, he found the problems facing post-war Britain elusive and intangible.

Frustrated and in poor health, he resigned in 1955, aged 81. Following his death in 1965, Churchill's body lay in state for 3 days at Westminster Hall before his state funeral. 



CANNES

	 	 
Cannes is first and foremost discovering the selection of films and then the wait for the awards to be attributed.
But it is also a place where the future of cinema is prepared, where politics and artists, North and South, Art and Industry cross paths, brush against each other or meet.
It is our job to channel, organise these meetings so as to make them fruitful. This year, the priority is for Europe and, on an international level, the fight against piracy.
During the Day for Europe, on May 18th, 25 Ministers of Culture will discuss with Milos Forman, Stephen Frears, Jean-Claude Carrière and young artists "becoming a filmmaker".
And May 16th, the heads of major international studios meet to try to find an appropriate answer to the issue of piracy.

For the Festival must also be a special place for tailor-made meetings. The Film Village has become a large town in which you can wander until you have lost the idea of what you were looking for: we accredit 30,000 professionals 1,000 of whom are authors/directors, 4,000 distributors, 5,000 producers and 4,000 journalists.

In this capital of cinema, we have to build bridges between these different professions, continents and film generations.
This year, some 40 young filmmakers from all over the world are coming to the Festival to feast on film: in the Short Film Corner, they will be able to see their works and, thanks to the new network of producers (400 members), maybe find the partner they are looking for. The International Village will enable each of them to find their feet and cultural roots in their national pavilion, before blending once more into the common melting pot of the world of film.

These new initiatives come to strengthen the experiences of the Cinéfondation, the Résidence du Festival or the Caméra d'Or, by providing fertile soil which, although it is not enough to create a work, does go some way to encouraging its growth and discovery.
By provoking encounters, confronting differences and emphasising concert, the Festival fertilises the film industry so that all those who wish it may continue to make not only films, but construct an oeuvre.

Once the future has been glimpsed, one can return to the present in which we must, as ever, create the best possible conditions to host and celebrate such films.
The celebration of cinema is, above all, about shared pleasure: the pleasure shared in discovering a film in the presence of the cast and crew, which is of course a priceless and often overwhelming experience. But shared pleasure is also listening to the great masters when they accept to pass on their knowledge: the Film Lesson with Stephen Frears, the Music Lesson with Lalo Schifrin and, for the first time this year, an Acting Lesson. It is also the tributes paid by the Festival, each one tailor-made to fit the person it wishes to honour: Jean Luc Godard is to receive a surprise this year that you will discover once arrived.

Lastly, the celebration of film also means festive moments in which the barriers that enclose us in our professions and countries rise to make possible the most improbable and joyous meetings. Una gran fiesta to open the Festival, as only Almodovar knows how, and a beautiful party to celebrate the Award Ceremony in music on Saturday 22nd., over the whole Bay of Cannes. This year, the festive spirit should reach the same heights as the pleasure received from the films.

And now, since I've arrived at the closing ceremony, a few words about the near future. I'd just like to mention that for the 60th anniversary of the Festival in 2007, we are discussing celebrating the occasion with the Centre Pompidou, as it is their 30th birthday the same year.

And we are working with Bernard Brochand, the Mayor of Cannes, on a Festival Museum project, the first stone of which should also be laid in 2007. 

THE OBSERVER
Michael Moore's controversial polemic Farenheit 9/11 became the first documentary for nearly 50 years to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival last night.

The film, which contains scathing attacks on the business dealings of President George Bush as well as the first footage of American soldiers torturing prisoners in Iraq, beat off competition from more famous directors, including Wong Kar-Wai, Emir Kusturica and the Coen brothers to scoop top prize.

Moore, who was given a standing ovation by the Cannes crowd, told them: 'I'm completely overwhelmed by this. Merci.'

He added: 'The last time I was on an award stage in Hollywood, all hell broke loose.' Moore had been heckled when he spoke out against Bush in his acceptance speech after winning an Oscar for his previous documentary, Bowling for Columbine.

He dedicated his victory to his daughter and to 'all the children in America, Iraq and around the world who have suffered as a result of our actions.'

The film has been the subject of controversy following a decision by Disney not to distribute it during an election year.

The prizes were decided by a jury led by Quentin Tarantino and including actresses Tilda Swinton, Kathleen Turner and Emmanuelle Beart.


THE GUARDIAN
The French appeared to have delivered another blow to George Bush's war on terror by awarding the Palme d'Or to Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore's documentary about the US president's foreign policy and war in Iraq.

But it was a jury with just one French member and four Americans which gave the top prize at the Cannes film festival to a documentary for the first time since 1956.

Last year the Palme d'Or went to Elephant, an American film dismissed as irresponsible by critics in the US for its portrayal of the Columbine high school massacre: a topic also covered by Moore in the past. This year, it was won by a film which Disney refused to distribute in the US.

Accepting the award after a standing ovation, Moore said he hoped Fahrenheit 9/11 would now be shown across the US. Disney blocked the distribution of the film, made by its subsidiary Miramax, and Miramax is now trying to find someone alse to put the film out before the presidential election in November. "Perhaps this film will have a tremendous impact. I hope it will," Moore said, adding that he hoped Mr Bush would not choke on a pretzel when he heard the news.

"He has the funniest lines in the film. I am eternally grateful to him," he said of the American president.

"I want to thank Mr Bush, Mr Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld. I thought the love scene between Cheney and Rumsfeld brought a tear to my eye."

Moore denied he set out to make a political film and said Quentin Tarantino, the jury's president, told him the political message of Fahrenheit 9/11 did not influence its decision.

The three French films in the competition all won awards while 14-year-old Yagira Yuuya was named best actor for playing the eldest of four siblings growing up without their mother in the Japanese film Nobody Knows.

Maggie Cheung's portrayal of a drug addict trying to rebuild her life in Clean won her the best actress award.

The grand prize, the second place award, went to the South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook for his thriller, Old Boy.

French films won the directing and screenwriting prizes: Tony Gatlif won the director's prize for Exiles, while Agnes Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri won the screenplay award for Look at Me, a study of an overweight woman's self-image.

Moore won an Oscar two years ago for Bowling for Columbine, his documentary attacking gun use in America.

CANNES, France (Reuters) - Critics gave a rapturous reception to "Shrek 2" at the Cannes film festival Saturday, guffawing over the tale of a green ogre who finds true love.

"Thank you for that," DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said after the critics, often notoriously hard to please at Cannes, welcomed the follow-up to the worldwide hit for voiceover stars Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz.

With global appetite raging for animation movies, Katzenberg said work had already begun on Shrek 3 and Shrek 4.

And he was quick to boast that this was the first time in the 57-year history of Cannes that a movie and its sequel had both been in competition for the coveted Palme d'Or.

DreamWorks flew in the voiceover cast for the Cannes screening, where many of the biggest laughs and the most applause went to Spanish heart-throb Antonio Banderas for his riotous portrayal of Puss-in-Boots.

He was quite happy to take a dig at himself on screen for the sake of laughs coming thick and fast.

"We are practically spoofing everything. I am spoofing myself doing Zorro. But it's not cheap parody. It is very well done," he told reporters.

Eddie Murphy, who returns as the fast-talking donkey, admitted it was unnerving to make an ass of himself on screen -- especially as he could recognize his own gestures.

"When you are doing the voiceover sessions, they have a video camera recording what you are doing and the animators will take a gesture or a facial expression," he said.

"Every so often that donkey makes a face like I do. It is scary," he told reporters.

Mike Myers, who returns as the ogre with a heart, was asked why so many Canadians went to Hollywood.

 "We export three things -- comedians, hockey players and various strains of wheat," he said.

"We are on the borders looking in and making comments. We look a lot like them but we are the enemy within -- the body snatchers," he said with a big grin.

British star Rupert Everett, who plays a riotously over-the-top Prince Charming in Shrek 2, was charm itself, answering his questions in French to the delight of local reporters.

The film is packed with jokey pop and Hollywood references. One of the biggest cheers came when the camera panned up from a bed shared by Shrek and his princess, played by Cameron Diaz.

On the wall was a poster of "Sir Justin."

But Diaz quickly knocked down with a curt answer a reporter who asked if her boyfriend, pop star Justin Timberlake, had liked the film.

"That is a question for him and he is not here and I can't really answer that for him," she said, a fixed grin firmly across her face.

CANNES, France (Reuters) - Critics rank Michael Moore as one of the favourites to land the top prize at the Cannes film Festival after his blistering anti-Bush documentary won a standing ovation.

"Fahrenheit 911" is now firmly in line to be the first documentary to land the Palme d'Or since Jacques Cousteau and Louis Malle's marine epic "The World of Silence" in 1956.

The documentary, launched in a storm of publicity after a row over its distribution in a U.S. election year, is a relentless tirade against Bush's handling of the Iraq conflict and the "war on terror."

Moore would dearly love to see Bush defeated in November's election and critics saw the emotive documentary as an effective rallying cry for his opponents.

Screen International, which takes the festival temperature every day, put Moore up with French director Agnes Jaoui's "Look at me" on Tuesday as one of the leading contenders.

The magazine asks critics from as far apart as Israel, Estonia and Canada to pick their favourites so far at the festival.

The influential Variety trade magazine called the film "a blatant cinematic 2004 campaign pamphlet" and said Moore could convince disillusioned and disenfranchised Americans to vote.

"He might prove somewhat successful due to the emotionalism of his pitch," it said.

The Hollywood Reporter said: "What Moore seems to be pioneering here is a reality film as an election year device."

Moore, a masterful self-publicist in stirring up controversy over his documentaries, was welcomed by fans like a rock star when he took to the red carpet at the Palais des Festivals on Monday night.

Cult film American film director Quentin Tarantino is heading the Cannes judges who pick the winner on Saturday of one of the movie world's most treasured prizes after the Hollywood Oscars.

Moore's latest documentary first hit the headlines when the Walt Disney Co barred its Miramax film unit from releasing such a politically polarising work so close to an election.

But Moore confidently predicted to reporters "This film will be seen in the United States before the election -- have no fear of that."

Judging by the 20-minute standing ovation for the film at its world premiere on Monday, Moore could be onto another winner.

Two years ago, his anti-gun lobby documentary "Bowling for Columbine" was rapturously received by the critics, went on to gross $120 million (68 million pounds) and landed Moore an Oscar.

CANNES (Reuters) - The world's biggest cinema showcase is braced for an ambush by part-time French actors and stagehands threatening to spoil Cannes's annual cocktail of sun, celebrity and celluloid.

Fearing protests by entertainment workers demanding state unemployment handouts, France laid on 1,000 police to protect the film festival which was due to open on Wednesday night with customary red-carpet razzmatazz.

"The Cannes festival is a jewel of French culture which must be protected and it cannot be hampered or destroyed by protests of any kind," said Cannes Mayor Bernard Brochant.

Always mired in controversy, this year's Cannes Film Festival is no exception with the premiere of American filmmaker Michael Moore's movie "Fahrenheit 9/11," a tirade against U.S. President George W. Bush.

Since the Madrid train bombings two months ago, security concerns have risen sharply across Europe. But for Cannes organisers, the biggest headache could be their own industry.

Part-time actors and technicians -- who stopped several French festivals last year in a row over their benefits when out of work -- blocked for several hours the trucks carrying the Cannes movies from Paris to the Riviera.

Organisers of the festival, halted in May 1968 at the height of student-worker protests, were trying to work with trade unions by offering them a platform to air their views.

MORE MOORE

Moore, lauded two years ago for his anti-gun lobby documentary "Bowling for Columbine," will compete with makers of 17 other films from around the globe for the coveted Palme d'Or award.

The Walt Disney Co has barred its Miramax film unit from releasing Moore's anti-Bush movie, saying it did not want to put out a politically polarising film in a U.S. election year.

"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers," a biography of the British comedian starring Geoffrey Rush and Charlize Theron, has angered his family.

Sellers's third wife, Britt Ekland, called the casting of Theron "nonsense" and Sellers's son has objected also.

Cult film director Quentin Tarantino heads the judges for this year's festival where a third of the films come from Asia.

It also offers a hefty dose of Hollywood mainstream with films like the animation hit follow-up "Shrek 2."

Berlin, Venice and Sundance are small but perfectly formed festivals where art is everything -- Cannes, by contrast, is brash and glitzy. Movie moguls do mega deals and Hollywood sends in its big guns.

For actor Brad Pitt, Cannes 2004 offers the chance to promote the $200 million sword-and-sandals epic "Troy".

For Tom Hanks, it's his maiden voyage to Cannes where he will be publicising the Coen brothers' remake of the classic British comedy "The Ladykillers".

"There's not a lot of firsts you can have if you've been in the business as long as I have but I'm sure the first time at Cannes will be an extraordinary thing," he said.

Cannes pits intellectual cinema critics against showbusiness writers who mock each other.

But, as London's Times wrote: "Cannes remains just what history has made it: a silly, splendid, valuable microcosm of the entire film industry."

PARIS (Reuters) - The world's most glamorous film showcase is bracing for possible disruptions by out-of-work French actors and stagehands protesting a change to their unemployment benefits.
	

Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres Wednesday announced the creation of a temporary fund to help part-time entertainment industry workers in a bid to quell their anger ahead of the Cannes festival, which runs from May 12 to 23.

However the Communist-led CGT union, which represents the majority of workers in the sector, rejected the 20-million-euro ($24.3 million) fund as inadequate and pledged to step up its year-long protests.

"We can already say at this stage that the 2004 Cannes festival will be memorable," it said in a statement.

The Riviera resort, a magnet for Hollywood movers and shakers, is scheduled to play host this year to stars including Brad Pitt and Charlize Theron. Veronique Cayla, general director of the festival, said organizers were working with unions to prevent any recurrence of the type of protests which forced the cancellation of a spate of French music and theater festivals last summer.

"We are working on ways of giving them a platform," she told the daily Liberation. Security at the Palais des Festivals, the main venue for film screenings, will be particularly tight in the wake of the Madrid train bombings in March.

"We do not expect the Palais des Festivals to be taken by storm. But we can't control everything. Provocateurs and hard-liners can join this just cause and spoil the party which the festival should rightly be," Cayla said.

In a bid to defuse tension, Donnedieu de Vabres will travel to Cannes to keep up talks with union officials on the sidelines of official events.

"I am calling for everybody to show respect for the artists, for their output, for the public and simply for the pride and international reputation of our country," the minister told parliament during question time.

The Cannes film festival has weathered its share of skirmishes in recent years.

In 2002, U.S. delegates threatened to boycott the festival on charges that France was anti-Semitic and last year, relations with the United States were at a low ebb over France's opposition to the war in Iraq. The show went on regardless.

(REUTERS) The French Riviera resort of Cannes rumbled into gear Monday for its world-famous annual film festival, where a cast of thousands will gather over the next two weeks to celebrate the magic of the silver screen.

Actors, directors, distributors, journalists and assorted hangers-on began to flood into the Mediterranean city for a seemingly endless cycle of screenings, news conferences and parties that has made this the high point of the movie calendar.

"You can't miss the Cannes festival. All the players on the planet meet there, hook up, make film projects," festival chief Gilles Jacob said in a recent magazine interview.

The festival, which runs from May 15 to 26, is primarily a showcase for the kind of art films that otherwise risk being ignored at the box office. But the intellectual fare is tempered with old-fashioned Hollywood glamour.

Cannes veterans like British directors Mike Leigh and Ken Loach, Portugal's Manoel de Oliveira and Israel's Amos Gitai are among those bidding for the coveted Palme D'Or award.

Celebrities expected to walk up the red carpet include Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Woody Allen, Jack Nicholson and Ralph Fiennes. They promise to restore the celebrity count after a threatened actors' strike kept many stars away last year.

For young filmmakers, the festival offers the chance to become an overnight star.

Witness Bosnian director Danis Tanovic, a virtual unknown, who premiered his film "No Man's Land" in Cannes last year and went on to win the Oscar for best foreign language movie.

"Since May 12, 2001, the date my film was shown at Cannes, my life has changed," Tanovic has said.

For others, the festival can prove a risky gamble. Earn bad reviews from the hundreds of film critics gathered here, and you can be virtually sure the film will flop at the box office.

Tim Robbins said last year he never again wanted to present a movie he has directed at the hectic festival. " don't get why you'd want to subject your baby to this place," the American actor-director told Reuters.

Many Hollywood studios, wary of the festival's reputation for rewarding obscure foreign films, opt to screen their offerings out of the competition.

Among those hugging the sidelines this year are Barbet Schroeder's "Murder by Numbers," starring Sandra Bullock, and the animated "Spirit" by Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio.

Special treats will include a 20-minute snippet from U.S. director Martin Scorsese's eagerly-awaited "Gangs of New York," starring DiCaprio and Diaz, scheduled for release in December.

George Lucas will attend a screening of "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones" on May 16, the same day the blockbuster production hits U.S. multiplexes.

If the jury is anything to go by, however, the big winner of the festival could be an altogether offbeat production.

Headed by director David Lynch, famous for his surreal and disturbing movies, the jury features five other directors in addition to actresses Sharon Stone and Michelle Yeoh.

That should give a running start to competitors like David Cronenberg, whose "Spider" stars Fiennes as a schizophrenic, or the eccentric Aki Kaurismaki, offering a film about an amnesiac, aptly entitled "The Man Without a Past."

American filmmaker Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11," a scathing indictment of White House actions after the Sept. 11 attacks, won the top prize Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival.

"Fahrenheit 9/11" was the first documentary to win Cannes' prestigious Palme d'Or since Jacques Cousteau's "The Silent World" in 1956.

"What have you done? I'm completely overwhelmed by this. Merci," Moore said after getting a standing ovation from the Cannes crowd.

The grand prize, the festival's second-place honor, went to South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook's "Old Boy," a blood-soaked thriller about a man out for revenge after years of inexplicable imprisonment.

Moore was momentarily flabbergasted when he took the stage to accept the award, a big difference from his fiery speech against President Bush after winning the best-documentary Academy Award for 2002's "Bowling for Columbine."

"You have to understand, the last time I was on an awards stage, in Hollywood, all hell broke loose," Moore said.

The best-actress award went to Maggie Cheung for her role in "Clean" as a junkie trying to straighten out her life and regain custody of her young son after her rock-star boyfriend dies of a drug overdose.

Fourteen-year-old Yagira Yuuya was named best actor for the Japanese film "Nobody Knows," in which he plays the eldest of four sibling raised in isolation, who must take charge of the family when their mother leaves.

The directing and writing prizes went to French filmmakers. Tony Gatlif won the directing honor for "Exiles," his road-trip about a couple on a sensual journey from France to Algeria.

Agnes Jaoui and her romantic partner, Jean-Pierre Bacri, won the screenplay award for "Look at Me," their study in self-image centering on an overweight young woman who feels neglected by loved ones. Jaoui and Bacri also co-star.

"Fahrenheit 9/11" won the top award from sharply divided Cannes moviegoers, who found a solid crop of good movies among the 19 entries in the festival's main competition but no great ones that rose to front-runner status.

While "Fahrenheit 9/11" was well-received by Cannes audiences, many critics felt it was inferior to Moore's Academy Award-winning documentary "Bowling for Columbine," which earned him a special prize at Cannes in 2002.

Some critics speculated that if "Fahrenheit 9/11" won the top prize, it would be more for the film's politics than its cinematic value.

With Moore's customary blend of humor and horror, "Fahrenheit 9/11" accuses the Bush camp of stealing the 2000 election, overlooking terrorism warnings before Sept. 11 and fanning fears of more attacks to secure Americans' support for the Iraq war.

Moore appears on-screen far less in "Fahrenheit 9/11" than in "Bowling for Columbine" or his other documentaries. The film relies largely on interviews, footage of U.S. soldiers and war victims in Iraq, and archival footage of Bush.

Just back in Cannes after his daughter's college graduation in the United States, Moore dedicated the award to "my daughter and to all the children in America and Iraq and throughout the world who suffered through our actions."

"Fahrenheit 9/11" made waves in the weeks leading up to Cannes after the Walt Disney Co. refused to let subsidiary Miramax release the film in the United States because of its political content. Miramax bosses Harvey and Bob Weinstein are negotiating to buy back the film and find another distributor, with hopes of landing it in theaters by Fourth of July weekend.

Quentin Tarantino headed the nine-member jury that handed out prizes in Cannes' main competition. The other jurors included actresses Kathleen Turner, Tilda Swinton and Emmanuelle Beart.

Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul's "Tropical Malady" - widely regarded by Cannes audiences as a snoozer for its elongated scenes of a man wandering a jungle alone, with no dialogue - won the festival's third-place jury prize.

Another jury prize went to Irma P. Hall for her role as an elderly Southern woman who foils a casino robbery in the Coen brothers' crime comedy "The Ladykillers," starring Tom Hanks as the heist's ringleader.

Keren Yedaya's "Or," about a Tel Aviv prostitute in failing health and her teenage daughter, won the Golden Camera award for best film by a first-time director. The U.S.-born Yedaya, who grew up in Israel, gives lectures about the problems of prostitution for government officials and mental-health professionals.

Earlier Saturday, Senegalese filmmaker Ousmane Sembene's "Moolaade," an examination of the ritual of female circumcision that earned rave reviews, won the top prize in a secondary Cannes competition called "Un Certain Regard."

The 12-day festival's closing film - "De-Lovely," Kevin Kline's musical biography of Cole Porter - screened immediately after the awards. Kline and co-star Ashley Judd then hosted a beach concert featuring Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette, Natalie Cole and other singers from "De-Lovely" performing Porter tunes.

The festival was to wrap up Sunday with encore screenings of award winners and other key movies that played the festival, including a combined, four-hour version of Tarantino's two "Kill Bill" installments.

Papers on the 60th anniversary of D-day.



	 In Schröder's attendance, Germany's rehabilitation
  	
Katrin Bennhold, International Herald Tribune
	
June 07, 2004
CAEN, France It is perhaps the final act of rehabilitation. For the first time Germany joined the club of Allied nations to celebrate Europe's liberation from the grip of fascism more than half a century ago.
.
The unprecedented attendance of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder at the 60th anniversary of D-Day on the beaches of Normandy on Sunday has drawn the most symbolic line yet between the Germany that attacked its neighbors in World War II and today's Germany, whose freedom and democracy were also born on June 6, 1944. "It's not the Germany of those dark ages that I represent here today," Schröder said at the Franco-German ceremony at the Caen Peace Memorial that brought the ceremonies on Sunday to a close. "My country has returned to the fold of civilized nations. It traveled a long road to become a successful and stable democracy." At the same time the chancellor struck a humble tone, stressing that rehabilitation must never mean forgetting. "We Germans know we unleashed this heinous war," the chancellor told veterans and other visitors at the Caen Peace Memorial. "We recognize the responsibility our history has laid upon us."
.
President Jacques Chirac hailed the German presence as the healing of a wound and a celebration of European integration."The European idea, the projects that it incarnates, were actually born here, with the end of the Third Reich," Chirac said at the joint address with Schröder. "What we owe our dead is to give a sense to their sacrifice, to resolutely commit to the only path that will ensure peace in Europe: that of reconciliation between our two countries."According to an IFOP opinion poll, 88 percent of French people say that it was a good to invite Schröder; 11 percent said they were unhappy with his presence. Reaction among veterans ranged from wholehearted acceptance to deep unease.
.
Rémy Dreyfus was 25 years old when he landed as a parachutist behind German lines. Of Jewish origin, he fled occupied France to train with Britain's Special Air Service. Dreyfus is a staunch European and believer in Franco-German reconciliation, but he says he will never be at ease with German veterans at the ceremonies. "I draw the line at 75," he said. "I have no problem with Germans below 75, but I can't deny that I look at those above the age of 75 in a different way."
.
Schröder, who was born in 1944 just weeks before the invasion, is the first chancellor not to remember the war. His predecessor, Helmut Kohl, a teenager during the last years of the war, was not invited to the 50th anniversary in 1994, disappointing many German veterans.
.
Alexander Uhlig, the only survivor of a parachute battalion, regrets that the Germans weren't invited earlier. "I think it's good that the Germans are here this time," he said.
.
Schröder tread carefully, choosing the British cemetery in Ranville, with some 332 German graves, rather than the large German cemetery of La Cambe, where 21,500 German soldiers are buried, including SS troops.

   	 For the Germans, the war's ambiguities persist
  	
John Vinocur/IHT 
	
Monday, June 7, 2004
Politicus
 
PARIS In joining with leaders of World War II's victorious Allies in their commemoration of D-Day, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has referred to Germany's presence on the Normandy invasion beaches as marking "the final end" to the postwar period and the completion of "Germany's long journey to the West."
.
Alongside the chancellor's argument that the Allies liberated the Germans from Nazi tyranny, what this comes down to is a kind of political assurance that Germany has forever abandoned its contemptuous notion of a mercantile, soulless West and its equally contemptuous but territorially hungry view of the lands beyond its eastern borders.
.
Coming in the context of Schröder's current drive to win Germany a seat on the United Nations Security Council, a statement sounding like a guarantee of its comfortable anchorage in the acquisitive, nonromantic world of capitalism finds few doubters.
.
But concerning Eastern Europe, Schröder's willful reading of his invitation to the D-Day anniversary as "the final end" to the postwar period is a different matter. It does not correspond entirely to current events and, for the time being, may be a bit of an imposition on history.
.
Germany's relationship in 2004 with the country's two major neighbors to the east - or, perhaps most precisely, that of a significant number of Germans - involves harsh, palpable difficulties.
.
With backing from mainstream conservative and Social Democrat personalities, politically powerful groups of expellees from former German territories in the Czech Republic and Poland are mounting newly aggressive campaigns to regain their old properties and memorialize themselves as World War II victims.
.
A week ago, the Christian Democratic Union's candidate for chancellor in 2002, Edmund Stoiber, spoke out in support of Bavarian conservatives' refusal in the European Parliament to approve Czech membership in the European Union. The reason was because the Prague government has turned its back on reviewing decrees that allowed Czechs to take over properties seized from Sudetenland Germans in 1945.
.
At the same meeting, Peter Glotz, a former general secretary of the Social Democratic Party, said that German tact over the issue of wartime expulsions must mean that when Germans talk about "our wounds," it is without the constraints of "politically correct murmuring." This is the sense of a Center Against Expulsion that Germans from the former Sudetenland and Prussian territories want built in Berlin.
.
In Poland, where 57 percent of the population views Germany negatively, the juxtaposition of the country's new presence in the European Union and Schröder's now officialized German view of a World War II ending with the Germans' liberation rather than their defeat is more than just an awkward coincidence. For Czechs as well, this adjusted reading of history accompanies an attempt to revive the issue of ownership of seized property based on a new legal front that the expellees opened with the entry of the two former Nazi-occupied countries into the EU on May 1.
.
While Schröder was saying that D-Day signaled "the starting point for today's new Europe" and maintained that the EU was "the best guarantor of peace" in Europe, Stoiber was arguing that this wider EU, now taking in the countries of the former Soviet orbit, must be on the side of the German claimants. "Will the EU remain silent over this?" he asked. "Europe must ask itself such questions now - and we're going to ask them."
.
Assuming that it was not Schröder's intent to reopen the war's resolved territorial issues, he nevertheless faced the issue of calming enraged Poles and Czechs, while appearing not to disavow millions of Germans defining themselves as victims. The chancellor, after all, has now asserted that Germans were being liberated in 1944 and 1945, just when the expellees were leaving areas that have become parts of Poland and the Czech Republic. Die Zeit, the Hamburg-based weekly that reported the poll results on Polish attitudes, published a long article recently saying that a group of expellees, like those who invited Stoiber and Glotz to their convention in Nuremburg, were calling "the postwar order into question and awakening the Poles' old fears and resentments." German-Polish relations, the newspaper said, "are enormously damaged."
.
Unquestionably, through its recognition of the Oder-Neisse line, Germany has given up any claim on dealing with lost territory or its border with Poland. But Die Zeit reported that the German Finance Ministry recently wrote to a potential claimant that the Federal Republic "never renounced individual claims by Germans," and pointed him in the direction of the courts.
.
In response, a Polish commission has set $31.5 billion (reckoned as much too low by some Poles) as the amount Poland should seek from Germany for damage during World War II if new German claims go ahead.
.
Attempting to reassure the Poles, the German government has spoken of proposed legal action as private initiative having nothing to do with German policy. But German jurists are said to consider that since the Germans and Poles have never reached a specific arrangement on the properties, the claims are not without potential validity. Die Zeit talked to a Polish historian, Krysztof Ruchniewicz, about the wider meaning and context of the moves by the expellees, who he said were regarded by Poles not as victims of Hitler but as supporters of the Nazis from regions that backed Hitler from his earliest days.
.
Ruchniewicz was not surprised by the developments, the article said. The climate for it was prepared during recent years in which the Germans looked at themselves increasingly as victims.
.
"This started," Die Zeit wrote, "with Gunter Grass's short novel 'Im Krebsgang' in 2002, which involved the deaths of thousands of Germans on board the torpedoed ship Wilhelm Gustloff, then went on to books and TV documentaries on the Allied bombing of German cities and then to the Federation of Expellees' call for the construction of a Center Against Expulsion. In Warsaw's mind, this center was going to be visible from Berlin's Holocaust Monument - for Poles, an intolerable relativization of German guilt."
.
Within the Berlin leadership, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, whose German family left Hungary with the collapse of the Nazi occupation there, has been the most vocal in acknowledging the ambiguities of the rise of an increasingly aggressive body of self-declared German victims of World War II.
.
Like most of the left, Fischer maintains that "the fall of Nazism was a liberation - for Germany too, precisely." Yet when the issue of a Center Against Expulsion first came up two years ago, Fischer opposed its becoming a national project.
.
If it were built on German soil, he said then, "You've got the reasonable suspicion that a rewriting of history is resulting from it, with a victim-oppressor reversal in roles."
.
Fischer linked the destruction of Jewish culture with what he called the self-destruction of German culture, old German cities and German minorities in World War II. Debate about expelled Germans "as victims" was totally lacking, he said, in the sense that in the public mind in Germany it generally began only with the German retreat and the advance of the Red Army.
.
"If you talk about expulsions," he said, "you can't leave out what went before. Otherwise you get into a fully false debate that says 'the Germans were also victims.' That's relativizing historical guilt and it comes with a confrontational, distorted perception of history which reflects neither the truth nor our European interests. The real debate is, What did we do to ourselves?"
.
In the case of the Center Against Expulsion, a bit of the confrontational nature of the proposal has been deflected by suggestions that it could be internationally funded, located outside Germany to calm the anger of Germany's neighbors and focused on the fate of displaced populations throughout the world.
.
But that has none of the heat and grip of scores of thousands of properties and potential German claims lying beyond the final lines drawn by a war that effectively settled the place of Germany in eastern Europe almost 60 years ago.
.
Now, with Schröder saying that D-Day began the process of firmly tying Germany to the West and that his invitation to Normandy marked the end of the postwar period, the old issues of Polish and Czech anxieties about Germans' intentions are back in a new form.
.

War turned invasion's overall commander into a pacifist
  	
John S.D. Eisenhower IHT
	
Sunday, June 6, 2004
The 60th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, on the day known in common parlance as D-Day, was once again an occasion to pause and contemplate its significance. Like all Americans, I am proud of the achievements of my fellow soldiers but aware of the ordeal they underwent. To this day, I view those men with respect bordering on awe.
.
To me, as the son of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the general who commanded that invasion, it carries an added dimension. I find it difficult to believe, even after all these years, that my own father was such a historic figure. Sixty years of repetitive observances of D-Day have not dimmed my wonder.
.
The observance takes on additional meanings this year. For one thing, it is the last decade in which most of us veterans of that war will still be around. In addition, however, the observances are taking place in times of extreme danger for our country. That circumstance invites many people to compare today's scene with that of 60 years ago. I am asked time and again, "What would your father think if he were alive today?"
.
At this point, I must emphasize that I cannot with any confidence give an opinion regarding what my father would make of today's scene. He was unpredictable when examining any new problem because he always viewed it in its entirety, totally free of thumb rules and largely independent of tradition. More obviously, the world has changed drastically during the 43 years since my father left the presidency in 1961.
.
When the British and American landing craft plowed through heavy seas to assault the beaches of Normandy that dreary June morning, General Eisenhower - I'll call him "Ike" for convenience - had no time or inclination to contemplate the social, political and economic consequences of the hoped-for military success in Europe. His mind was full of other things: Were the landings successful? How far had the troops been able to push inland? How heavy were the losses? What is the condition of the artificial harbors and the beaches? It was an experience of the moment.
.
Yet those worries quickly passed. When I joined my father for a brief visit in London a week after D-Day, the experience of D-Day had virtually disappeared from his mind. The day's dramatic events, with their threat of disaster for the Allied cause but eventual triumph, were gone. D-Day was one event in a sequence of events that culminated in the destruction of the Nazi regime and the German war machine.
.
The experience of that 11-month campaign, plus Ike's later service as the first military commander of NATO six years later, produced profound effects on him, changing some of his convictions and confirming others. I would like to list some of them, not in the abstract but by the evidence of his later actions.
.
The most fundamental conviction that the period of Ike's command in Europe and the Mediterranean imprinted on his mind was the cruelty, wastefulness and stupidity of war. He saw at firsthand how war destroyed cities, killed innocent people (in which I include most of the participating soldiers), wiped out national economies and tore up the structure of civilizations. Its wastefulness cut him to the bone, and its specter never left him. As a result, as president he kept the military budget as small as was consistent with the safety of the nation. He expressed his convictions eloquently in April 1953, about three months after his inauguration as the 34th president of the United States:
.
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
.
"The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.
.
"It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population.
.
"It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals\u2026.
.
"We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed 8,000 people."
.
Not surprisingly, the war that included D-Day had made a pacifist of the man who bore the responsibility, its supreme commander.
.
As I consider the effect that D-Day and the war in Europe had on my father, I am struck by the degree to which it convinced him of the value of allies. Ike, in leading an army and air force of five million soldiers and airmen of all nationalities, realized full well that the United States, while providing the bulk of the materiel and manpower, could never go it alone. Though Hitler's Wehrmacht was weakened after five years of war, the vaunted and professional German Army still had a lot of fight left in it when the Anglo-American armada crossed the English Channel in 1944. Later in the campaign, the hedgerows, dense forests and formidable rivers such as the Roer and the Rhine, worked all to Hitler's advantage. The ability to switch German forces back and forth between the Russians in the east and the Western Allies in France, Belgium and Luxembourg gave Hitler's generals great power. They were still a formidable force to defeat.
.
To Ike, therefore, his British (and later French) allies were no luxury; they were absolutely necessary. But they were no toadies. Dealing with the strong-minded leaders of Britain and France - Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle respectively - was difficult. At times it was frustrating. But always it was rewarding. Ike viewed allies as invaluable assets, not only for their material contributions, but for their wisdom as well. Ike did not consider that giving in to their demands when necessary was any sign of weakness on his own part. Doing so was simply part of a great cooperative effort.
.
With his detestation of war as a means of settling international disputes, Ike applauded the formation of the United Nations in 1945, even though he had no hand in its formation. Leaving the army in 1948 for private life, he was recalled to active duty in early 1951 to organize the military forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization when the military threat from the east seemed to become imminent. In his stay in Paris, Ike developed a strong belief in NATO that he never lost.
.
It so happens that I was witness to one example of Ike's concern for the opinions and attitudes of his allies during his presidency. In September 1959, Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union served up an ultimatum to the Western allies to get out of West Berlin or else. Ike chose to negotiate while rejecting the ultimatum. In the course of the ensuing talks, a mix-up in signals in the State Department resulted in an unintended invitation for Khrushchev to visit the United States alone, not in the company of all the nations involved in the current crisis.
.
That unilateral invitation may or may not have turned out to be a good thing, but the incident illustrated Ike's concern that his allies - now Britain, France and the newly emerging West Germany - be assured that he had no intention of representing their interests in his forthcoming conferences with Khrushchev. So Ike took some of his personal staff and boarded a new Boeing 707 on its maiden voyage as Air Force One to visit Konrad Adenauer in Bonn, Harold Macmillan in Britain and de Gaulle in Paris. With all of them he conducted frank talks, and Ike's allies were reassured. He would have it no other way.
.
Ike totally disapproved of "preventive war," and that conviction was put to the test early in his presidency. Some time in the early 1950s the Soviet development of the hydrogen bomb and the means to deliver it caused many Americans, some of Ike's advisers among them, to advocate launching a preemptive strike against the Soviet Union while the United States still enjoyed a preponderance of atomic power and the means of delivering atomic weapons. It would be preferable, these people argued, to remove the Soviet weapons of mass destruction. No legal or moral justification was required. A few million Americans would be killed, of course, but a far fewer number than if we waited and allowed the "Evil Empire" (not Ike's term) to strike first.
.
Ike would have none of it. Throughout his presidency he combined a policy of maintaining a military deterrent to war while at the same time extending the hand of friendship. The uneasy peace between the United States and the Soviet Union - the cold war - continued for nearly 50 years. It was expensive and it was dangerous, but civilization survived.
.
A less apocalyptic event demonstrated to the world that Ike's rejection of force as an instrument of national policy applied to everyone - to America, to America's friends, as well as to America's potential enemies. In the later months of 1956, in the midst of a presidential election, Britain, France and Israel, two of them NATO allies, launched an attack against Egypt's Gamal Abdul Nasser after his seizure of the Suez Canal. The Egyptian action, admittedly, had been an international headache, but Ike refused to condone the use of force, even by his friends. He sponsored a vote of censure in the United Nations, and the governments of those three countries, under the pressure of world opinion, withdrew their forces.
.
This action on Ike's part did not imply rancor against the offenders. It was simply an expression of principle. This he demonstrated in the immediate aftermath of the episode. In the course of the brief fighting, Nasser had sunk ships enough to close down the Suez Canal. Ike and his experts immediately sat down to plan ways to ensure at least a minimum supply of heating oil to bring Western Europe through the winter of 1956-57.
.
While the recitation of these events seems remote from the D-Day we are commemorating, I offer them as offshoots of Dwight Eisenhower's experiences in the campaigns of 1944-45. Many of Ike's policies were different from those we see being followed today. But he was the first to admit that situations change, and the policies followed in one generation might be used as guides to future action but never rules. How he would view today's world scene, I repeat that I do not know.
.
But I wonder.

On cliff over Omaha Beach, a man who fought remembers
  	
John Vinocur NYT
	
Friday, June 4, 2004
Pointe du Hoc is a knife, stood on its edge, pointed into the sea. It looks lethal, a palisade of boulder and mean rocks where Normandy's green softness has reclaimed nothing. Battlefields: You could walk them from Gettysburg to Waterloo and go back to your car thinking of lunch. But not at Pointe du Hoc. The brightest morning roughens there, the wind working like a rasp, still scoring cruel edges on the sheer cliffs. On D-Day, the U.S. Army's Second Ranger Battalion had to climb the knife's blade through bullets and shells. In 1984, looking down to the sea from the viewpoint of the German machine-gun emplacements, imagination becomes superfluous. The emotions are all immediate and distinct: My God, they made it to the top; this is still a cruel place; it holds the mark of a killing ground.
.
Pointe du Hoc is special. For the most part, the pastoral blanket of Normandy covers over any sense of the fury, the dying and the scale involved in the thrust of 180,000 Allied troops into Europe on the 6th of June, 1944. The pastures are too lush, the land too rich with apple orchards and rose arbors. In Normandy, near the beaches, the war burned fast. There is no complaint, of course - the Allies rushed through the nearby countryside and were soon gone; 11 months after D-Day, Hitler's Europe fell. Occasionally, a speech (hundreds are scheduled this year) will resemble the regrown landscape and turn the invasion to whole glory, leaving the dead as a detail. Reality was something else. In the first 25 hours, the U.S. 1st Army had 6,603 casualties; two months later, the Americans had to use bulldozers to clear a passage through the 40,000 German corpses at Chambois to the south.
.
Normandy, its landscape healed, soothes mostly, and holds tightly to its emotions. They are there, although not much at Utah or Omaha Beaches, or in the invasion museums, where models of the engineering feats have the look of Erector sets, and the old uniforms seem like rock band gear from costume shops. The sense of war, the extraordinary bravery of the Allied armies, the numbers, the losses, the real suffering that disappears in time and commemorative oratory, are not marked out in any red guidebook of the emotions, but they are present if you look.
.
I went to the D-Day beaches for the first time 15 years ago, in May 1969, expecting no feelings at all. Europe seemed so rich and self-content that it was hard to believe that the United States had to come to help. World War II, just 25 years earlier, felt terribly long ago then; in 1969 there was too much war going between my own contemporaries, all of it bad, the just cause not having leaped the generational gap. I had just returned from Biafra reporting on a ghastly and lunatic war of starved children and big oil interests, and the news in the papers was of Hamburger Hill, the tag name for a place the U.S. Army was having trouble capturing in Vietnam. The stories made clear that there were grunts who did not want to go into the fire, and the accounts, I thought, were written with the sympathy of the times, and probably often read that way too.
.
I got to Pointe du Hoc mostly by accident then because the road was not well marked and seemed to peter out in the fields. The wind jumps up from the sea as you get closer, and the fields begin to roll and dip, cratered by the Allied offshore bombardment. At the edge of the cliffs, the wind is a smack, and D-Day becomes wildly clear: climbing that cutting edge into the bullets. The first men came up on rope, and then ladders belonging to the London Fire Department. The Germans, firing down at them, even rolling boulders over the precipice, killed more Americans in the first wave than those who got to the top.
.
The day I was there, a man paced around Pointe du Hoc as if he were taking measurements for a linoleum company. His name was Robert Fruling, he worked in a spare parts department in West Palm Beach, Florida, and he was looking around because he had come up the cliffs as a Ranger. I heard how he got hell for losing the radio he was toting, and how a bullet went through his helmet, kindly following a path that avoided his head. He talked about the place with a kind of chirpy good humor for a while and then he stopped. About 75 men of the 235 he came ashore with survived. "We got it, and we got it," he said, and turned away. He bent over shaking with sobs.
.
There is as much death as glory now at Pointe du Hoc, and somehow, in a recriminating 1984 Europe, a disenchanted one, the battlefield and D-Day seem more real than in 1969. Do we discuss going up the cliff? Not here. Pointe du Hoc offers its own conclusions, a battlefield never gone quite still.
.
The quiet lies elsewhere, its emotions strong. The American cemetery at Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer is a great lawn at the edge of the sea, white marble crosses and Stars of David against an open horizon. It is a graceful, light, uncomplicated place. I think of it as very American in the best sense: no phony piety, simple, easy. The graves are the message, and they are left alone: long rows, long rows, long rows. Unequivocal. The monument is inscribed with monument-inscription language, but minus the tremolo, it is right: "This embattled shore, portal of freedom, is forever hallowed by the ideas, valor and sacrifice of our fellow countrymen." At Cambe, near Isigny, away from the sea, and off a main road, there is a German cemetery. It is a very different place, a powerful one, not so simple, not so certain, one that is more of this than that other time. The headstones are low and dark, almost black, looking like Knight's Crosses. The grass is let to grow high, and it moves in the wind against the dark stones. The Germans executed scores of French hostages at Caen, nearby, the night of the invasion, but no one has ever touched, tried to vandalize, these graves. They have extraordinary dignity. As much as Saint-Laurent seems American in its emotions, as much as it seems to reflect the right war and its cost, La Cambe strikes me as German; it has real beauty, and a dark, melancholy strength.
.
How do you mark the graves of a defeated army, fighting for monstrous goals, on the land of a country it had conquered? "Here lie German soldiers," one inscription says. On a pedestal in the same dark stone, old parents huddle and grieve. And this, chiseled deep: "God has the last word."
.
This is the 40th anniversary of D-Day. The law of round numbers and memorial reflection probably mean that the next time people think about it much is in another 10 years. In spite of Normandy's forgetting meadows, the cliffs and the graveyards will not lose their strength, their terror, their message.








US and France: We still need each other

U.S.-France
 
NEW YORK On Sunday, President George W. Bush will stand at attention next to President Jacques Chirac of France at the American military cemetery near Omaha Beach. Thousands of Frenchmen and Americans will mingle on the site to remember, mourn and celebrate the young men who died in the Normandy landings 60 years ago.
.
While there are, today, some Americans who like to think that the French don't remember D-Day, that is far from the truth; they do remember, and they are grateful. I travel to France regularly and it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world - one that is inhabited by some of the most intelligent and, yes, complicated people in the world. On one subject, the French are united: they are consumed with anxiety (and curiosity) about the decline of the French-American relationship. Despite the hostility generated by the war in Iraq, they wish for the relationship to be better.
.
On the American side of the ocean, there is no such curiosity, much less anxiety. There is only a certain dismissiveness and this silent reproach: "They don't remember." That is both untrue and self-defeating. It is difficult to understate France's importance to Europe - and to us.
.
To repair the relationship, though, we need to understand how it unraveled. While the mistakes made by both our governments in the run-up to the Iraq war did grave damage, they are only part of the story. The United States and France have been moving apart in fundamental ways for a long time now.
.
As the world has changed - shaped by the end of the Soviet threat, the economics of globalization and the rise of terrorism - France, Europe and America have inevitably changed, too.
.
The election of Bush and the events of 9/11 intensified the pace of change in America. America's immediate focus became a global war on terrorism: absolute military domination was combined with the concept of pre-emptive war. Americans became more patriotic, and struggled with the reality that we were both invincible and vulnerable.
.
This was in stark opposition to what was going on in Europe. Just as we were becoming more warlike and unilateral, France and Europe were working toward European integration while trying to minimize conflict wherever possible.
.
Our economies were also diverging. While in the 1960s and 1970s we were on reasonably parallel paths, the American economy began to surge ahead of France's in the 1980s, the result of higher population growth, increased productivity and large investments in technology. America's interests also turned increasingly toward countries like China, India and Russia. The priorities of France, meanwhile, revolved more and more around European enlargement and its own role in Europe.
.
I had the privilege of serving as ambassador at a time when the French-American relationship was quite positive, despite serious problems with respect to Iraq and any number of other issues, from genetically modified foods to the death penalty. The military cooperation in the Balkans was excellent, the economic partnership was booming and the personal relationships between Chirac and President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine were solid.
.
Even then, though, one could sense that the relationship was evolving. When Vedrine referred to "American hegemony" and to the United States as a "hyperpower," Albright took it as criticism. In fact, it was more a combination of admiration, envy and fear, expressed by a sophisticated Frenchman. And all those fears came true when we marched into Iraq, and brought war to the outer borders of Europe.
.
Today, there is no such thing as old and new Europe; they are both the European Union, which has been evolving for 50 years. There is, however, a "new America," and it looks at Europe with a certain disdain because we believe that our main interests are elsewhere. To some extent, however, the same can be said for France. Yet America is beginning to realize that solitude, even for a global superpower, may not be the best policy. The Bush administration's request for UN assistance in Iraq and the cooperation with France in Haiti may be belated recognition of the reality that America needs the legitimacy conferred by the international community when it exercises its power.
.
I have seen France at its most tragic in 1940, and I have seen it at its best in later years. Although there will still be differences about Iraq and other issues, I know that France and America need each other strategically, economically, culturally.
.
And beyond that, there is the history buried in the cemetery of Omaha Beach. We need a relationship built on mutual respect as well as mutual interest. Perhaps it will be rekindled on Omaha Beach.

   	 A German childhood healed by GIs

Friday, June 4, 2004
CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts In the last days of April 1945, the Allied front was approaching my home town in southern Westphalia. Around us were the signs of a collapsing country: smoking ruins, battered German troops moving through the town, old men - including my father, whose World War I wounds had until then protected him from front-line duty - being rushed to the Ruhr area for a last-ditch defense
.
My life as a 10-year-old was not much different from the lives of the adults: bombed repeatedly inside and outside shelters, learning to appreciate ditches when free-roaming fighter planes shot at everything that moved on the ground.
.
It must have been the spreading sense of doom and possibly the impact of the ongoing propaganda about "Anglo-American terror tactics" that led my mother to conclude that a battle in the city would be worse than anything we had experienced so far. So we fled to the countryside, with the help of a pound of coffee, in a truck propelled by those amazing wood-burning engines of the time, two people always scanning the skies for planes.
.
However, when we arrived at our destination, an isolated forester's house with a broad view on a valley, matters quickly worsened. The retreating German army established a headquarters there while we, along with a dozen other women and children, crouched in the cellar, listening with growing concern to the hectic activity upstairs and the approaching rumble of artillery and tanks.
.
Suddenly there was a lot of shouting and running above us, and the Germans left, followed first by silence, then the clank of what were obviously American tanks. They stopped outside the house. Over the idling engines we heard the door to the cellar being thrown open. Would they now toss a grenade down, as we assumed Americans always did? We heard a person cautiously coming down the steps and stopping in front of our door. We remained totally silent, expecting something terrible to happen. Suddenly the door was pushed open, and the barrel of a rifle appeared, followed very slowly by an American helmet. The soldier under itquietly surveyed us, then smiled and said, "Hi." The war was over. We were alive.
.
Only later did I realize how the humane treatment of civilians by the U.S. Army, indeed their friendly behavior (defying in many cases General Dwight D. Eisenhower's orders against fraternization) not only undid the negative images of America created by Nazi propaganda, but also helped a generation of young Germans to grow up with a positive image of American soldiers.
.
In that forester's house I listened to the Americans talking with the grownups, through a teacher of English in our group, about what had been wrong with the Hitler regime. The Americans shared C-rations with us kids and established order in our town when it was threatened by chaos. When looters attacked our house I ran to the nearby U.S. Army headquarters for help, and an American soldier jumped in a truck with me, rushed to our place and dispersed the bandits by shooting in the air. Countless young American officers helped to restart towns all over Germany. That American troops remained throughout the cold war to protect us and to preserve a free Berlin solidified the positive image.
.
Strangely it was the images of Germans with tears in their eyes when American soldiers left Berlin in 1994 that flashed through my mind when I saw the horrible pictures of American soldiers mistreating and torturing prisoners in Abu Ghraib. Although suspicions about Guantánamo had already begun undermining the image of American military forces, the shock effect of those revelations on America's allies was and remains profound.
.
America's friends in Europe and presumably all over the globe now invest their hope in the corrective power and strength of democracy in the United States, which sacrificed so many thousands of its soldiers to uphold these very values on our side of the Atlantic 60 years ago.

The white star of freedom
  	
IHT
	
Friday, June 4, 2004
PARIS In Auschwitz, June 6, 1944, was a day like any other. Hitler's cattle trains were discharging their human cargo for mass destruction at the same hellish pace. The death toll in the gas chambers that day was higher even than the enormous losses suffered by the combined armies under General Dwight Eisenhower's command.
.
We had every reason to believe that the war was irrevocably lost, that the Red Army had been smashed, that England was fighting alone against the seemingly invincible forces of darkness. And America? It was so far away, so divided, so unprepared. How could it be expected to reverse the tide of doom?
.
It took weeks for news of the invasion, beamed by the BBC, to slip into the camp via the Polish resistance. There was also a rumor that the Russians had mounted an offensive on the eastern front. Oh, to hang on a little longer! I was 15 and I wanted to live.
.
We could tell from the growing nervousness of our guards that the weight of battle was shifting. They were herding us deeper into Germany. It was in a slave labor enclave of Dachau that I heard for the first time the silence of the night torn by distant explosions. Within hours we were evacuated again, ahead of the "enemy advance." These magic, intoxicating words were now openly murmured.
.
My final death march continued day and night, halting only for meager rations of bread and water. At dawn, on the third day, a squadron of Allied fighter planes, mistaking our column for Wehrmacht troops, swooped down to strafe us. As the SS-men hit the dirt, their machine guns blazing, their vicious dogs growling, a comrade near me shouted, "Run for it!" A group of us made a clumsy sprint for the trees. Only five reached the forest alive. We kept running, gasping for breath, until we collapsed. There was no sound of pursuit; just the thunder of our hearts and the long-forgotten music of chirping birds.
.
At night we began moving toward the western front. One bucolic afternoon, holed up in the hayloft of an abandoned Bavarian barn, I became aware of a hum, like a swarm of bees, only louder, metallic, unearthly. I peeped though a crack in the wooden slats. Across the field, a huge tank, leading a military convoy, lumbered my way. From somewhere to one side I could hear the firing of mortars. The tank's cannon turned and let loose a deafening blast. The firing stopped. The tank resumed its cautious advance.
.
I looked for the hated swastika. Instead I saw an unfamiliar emblem - a five-pointed white star. In an instant the unimaginable flooded my soul. After so many tortures and humiliations in the pit of the abyss, I was beholding the glorious insignia of the U.S. Army.
.
With a wild roar, I ran toward the wondrous vision, waving my arms. Suddenly, the hatch of an armored vehicle opened, and a face shielded by helmet and goggles emerged, swearing at me unintelligibly. At that instant I felt immortal, though to the startled GI my situation must have seemed desperate indeed. Pistol in hand, he jumped to the ground to examine me more closely, as if to make sure that the kid was not booby-trapped.
.
To signal that I was a friend, and in need of help, I fell to my knees, threw my arms around his legs, summoned the few English words my mother used to sigh while dreaming of our deliverance, and yelled: "God Bless America!" With an unmistakable gesture the tall American motioned me to get up, and lifted me through the hatch - into the womb of freedom.
.
Today, when a wave of anti-Americanism is sweeping the world, when GIs are accused of being amoral and sadistic, the survivor in me exclaims, "Never forget the courageous soldier and the compassionate army that once brought you life and liberty." But the jurist in me cautions, "Those responsible for the scandalous mistreatment of prisoners of war must be brought to justice."
.
I have learned from bitter experience that war is ugly and chaotic. In Iraq, its management has been undermined by serious errors of strategy and outrageous lapses of discipline. Small wonder that America's vigorous democracy is in the throes of a soul-searching debate on its thankless mission as liberator of the oppressed.
.
Yet, in the explosive Middle East, where the stakes are colossal for all concerned, its responsibilities are as vital as they are difficult. Were the United States to succumb to isolationist ghosts, it would disastrously weaken those striving for security, tolerance and progress in a terrorist-ridden world, when Al Qaeda is threatening to sow havoc on all continents.
.
At this critical juncture, when sovereignty is being transferred to Iraqis, responsible leaders on all continents, even those who opposed the war, must reach out for an international consensus and a common strategy to stabilize Iraq and combat global terrorism, in the same spirit of international and trans-Atlantic solidarity with allies and adversaries that won the peace after World War II and, ultimately, the cold war. Such, it seems to me, is the message and the warning of D-Day.

France   

	 Chirac's offer to Sarkozy: A poisoned chalice?
  	
Katrin Bennhold/IHT 
	
Friday, June 25, 2004
PARIS In the latest chapter of the simmering power struggle between France's two most closely watched politicians, President Jacques Chirac told his finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, that he was free to seek the presidency of the ruling party, traditionally seen as paving the way to the presidency.
.
The catch: Sarkozy has to give up his ministerial duties, according to sources close to Chirac.
.
It is yet another poisoned chalice dangling in front of Sarkozy, France's most popular minister, political experts said Thursday.
.
The proposal leaves the 49-year- old Sarkozy with a dilemma: quit his job at the Finance Ministry after barely three months, giving the impression that he puts his career before his country, or stay put and forgo the full-blown support of the financing and campaign machine that is the Union for a Popular Movement, or UMP, ahead of the next presidential election in 2007.
.
"This is very clever maneuvering," said Brice Teinturier, director of political studies at the Paris-based Sofres Institute. "Given how popular Sarkozy is, it would be very difficult for Chirac to oppose his candidacy, so he is trying to stifle his ambitions without saying it."
.
Blocking Sarkozy's candidacy would be politically touchy for several reasons, he said. Chirac's party suffered a humiliating defeat in recent local and European elections.
.
The current president of the party, Alain Juppé, was convicted in January of charges connected with illicit party financing a decade ago and is in the process of appealing.
.
Sarkozy is the most popular member of the government at a time when both Chirac and the prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, have seen their approval ratings slump.
.
The UMP's leadership contest is planned for an unspecified date in the second half of November.
.
The two men met Tuesday at the presidential Elysée Palace and had a talk that was described as "very cordial" by officials close to Chirac. A Finance Ministry spokesman declined to comment. While a decade ago Sarkozy was a protégé of the president, he fell out of favor in 1995 when backing Edouard Balladur in his failed challenge of Chirac for the presidency in 1995.
.
Since then, Sarkozy has made no secret of his ambition to one day reside in the Elysée Palace himself. When asked in a television interview last year whether he thought about being president when he shaved, he famously replied: "Not only then."
.
And yet, Chirac, who is 71, has been unable to keep Sarkozy out of government: He is too popular. Opinion polls routinely show that Sarko, as he is known by the French media, is the most popular minister in the country and even beats the president approval ratings. According to a poll by Ifop published this month, 49 percent of respondents prefer Sarkozy over Chirac, who garnered 41 percent support. "Sarkozy is very popular," said Bruno Jeanbart, head of political research at the polling company CSA in Paris. "If he runs for the UMP presidency, he can easily win it. Chirac clearly hopes that he won't run after all." The president knows firsthand how important the backing of a political party is in any presidential bid. In France, where private donations to support election campaigns are largely outlawed, the parties are the only source of financing for hopeful candidates. When Chirac won against Balladur in 1995, it was largely due to the support of the UMP's predecessor party, the Rally for the Republic.
.
Chirac's proposal bears risks for both sides, analysts say.
.
The president must avoid to be seen fearing his finance minister, so any attempts to put obstacles in his way must be subtle, Teinturier said. "If Sarkozy makes it look like he is forced out of government after winning the election, he could come out as the victim in the public eye," he said. It is not the first time that an apparently well-meant offer holds risks: After his successful stint as interior minister, Chirac asked Sarkozy to take over the Finance Ministry at a time of sluggish economic growth, high unemployment and unpopular structural reforms. So far that has done little to dent Sarkozy's popularity, though. His outspoken manner, often intruding on terrain traditionally considered the president's preserve, has irked Chirac more than once. He directly contradicted Chirac when, as interior minister last year, he endorsed the idea of affirmative action, a concept considered taboo in France's proudly egalitarian society. And he openly criticized the ban of Muslim headscarves in public schools.

Interview in The New Scientist
Saying no to Saddam  	 	
.

For refusing to work on Saddam Hussein's weapons programme, Hussain Al-Shahristani spent 11 years as a prisoner in the infamous Abu Ghraib jail. As Iraq struggles to rebuild, he was recently put forward as a candidate to head the interim government. He explains to Michael Bond why he declined. He is now calling for other scientists around the world to boycott research on all weapons of mass destruction
 
 

How well did you know Saddam Hussein?

I knew Saddam closely because he was head of the Atomic Energy Commission in the 1970s even before he became president.

What was he like?

I was never impressed by him. I knew that he was a vicious man who would not hesitate to send people to be executed when they had very minor differences with him. He never impressed me with any intelligence or insight. Sometimes I thought he made a fool of himself by commenting on scientific issues. At meetings he would mostly just listen to the scientific arguments and then make a decision on what should be done, but on occasions he would comment on subjects I thought he did not have much knowledge of. What was very clear to all of us was his authoritarian style and the way he tried to dominate everybody around him. He behaved as if he was above everybody else, as if he controlled everybody and everything. His word was final and no one else could take decisions.

When he became president of Iraq in 1979 he asked you to work on an atomic weapons programme. What happened?

I was the chief scientific adviser to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission when Saddam appointed himself president. He wanted to redirect our research activities from peaceful applications to what were referred to as strategic applications. I refused to work on the programme.

Was that an easy decision to make?

Fairly easy. It was clear to me that any weapons in his hands would be used against the Iraqi people. I could not find myself working on any military programme, particularly for Saddam. In taking that decision I knew what the consequences would be, but I didn't have much choice. The options were either to work with him and enable him to kill tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or to take a stand and pay the price. My religious convictions obliged me to choose the latter.

Yet many of your fellow scientists did agree to work on Saddam's weapons programmes
.

Yes, other scientists were forced to work on them. But of course they needed some convincing: some were arrested, tortured, kept in mental hospitals and so on, and eventually they were persuaded to go back and work on the weapons programme.

What happened to you when you refused?

I was arrested in December 1979. I was interrogated and tortured for 22 days and nights. In my case they were gentler because they did not want to leave any permanent bodily marks on me. They hung me from the ceiling by my hands, which were tied behind my back. They used electric probes on sensitive parts of my body and beat me. There were others in the torture chambers who were treated far worse. In one case I witnessed a guy having holes drilled into his bones with electric drills. The most painful thing in those torture chambers was to hear the screams of children being tortured to extract confessions from their fathers.

What did they do with you then?

I was sentenced to life imprisonment and taken to Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. I was visited by Saddam's step-brother, who came to my cell and expressed his disappointment in what they had done to me, and tried to persuade me to go back to my work. He told me there was a place for me at the presidential palace. I said I was not in a position to do so, both physically because I was half-paralysed after being tortured, and also because weapons research was not my specialty. Then he said that any man who was not willing to serve his country did not deserve to be alive. I said that it was our duty to serve our country, but that this was one service I could not do. At this point I was ordered to solitary confinement for 10 years. I was there from May 1980 to May 1990, on Saddam's personal orders.

Psychologically, how did you survive those years?

I tried to keep my mind busy. It was difficult. I made up mathematical problems which I then tried to solve. I spent time trying to remember scientific problems and mentally worked on developing them. Of course there was a limit to what I could do without paper and pencil, and without any reference books and so on. I wasn't allowed anything like that. I was deprived of any books, even a copy of the Koran, newspapers, even Ba'ath party newspapers, and radio. I was completely incommunicado. But I tried to keep my mind alive by going over whatever I knew.

How did you escape?

In those years in solitary confinement the guy responsible for my cell was a fellow prisoner in the service of the security officers. Nobody at this time was allowed to utter a word to me. This guy would come into my cell with a plate of food for me once a day and would not say anything. But one day he talked to me. He said: "Dr Hussein, I know all about you, the whole country respects you, if there is anything I can do let me know and I will do it." I thought it was a ploy by the intelligence officers to trick me. I thanked him and left it at that. But we grew to trust each other, and I planned my escape with him. One night in February 1991, after the invasion of Kuwait, when Baghdad was blacked out and there was an aerial bombardment of the city, we took one of the cars used by the security officers and, dressed in their uniforms, made our escape. We went into hiding in the north and then I left Iraq with my family and became a refugee.

Would you like to see more scientists around the world follow your example and take a stand against unethical practices?

Definitely. Scientists in particular have that moral obligation because people look up to them as the educated who know more than the average person. This puts a heavy burden on them to make sure their knowledge is used for the best of humanity and to serve mankind. I could not disagree more with any scientist who says his concern is his work and that the consequences of his discoveries are irrelevant. You have to think whether the results of your work will harm other people or help them. I don't think anyone with any sense of decency should allow himself or herself to be used as a tool to destroy other people.

Are there any areas of science that especially concern you?

I would like to seek this opportunity to call on fellow scientists around the world to refrain from working on weapons of mass destruction in particular. Such weapons will not enhance national security, but rather encourage rulers to be more aggressive and less compromising in solving international problems.

The west should take the lead in destroying any stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons in its possession and make sure that such weapons are also eliminated from the rest of the world. I would also like to see more progress made on nuclear disarmament in the coming few years.

Your decision not to work on a nuclear weapon stemmed, you said, from your religious convictions. Has your faith ever put you in conflict with your science?

On the contrary. Muslims were told by Prophet Mohammed that they should seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave. He also told Muslims that knowledge that is of no benefit to the people is useless knowledge. So we are encouraged not only to seek knowledge but also to make sure that the knowledge we acquire is of benefit to humanity. I do not find a conflict between my religious values and my science; on the contrary, I think it was my religious understanding to seek knowledge and make sure it is put to the good of humanity that made me take the stand I took.

What did you do in exile?

I devoted my time to helping fellow refugees. I chair the Iraqi Refugee Aid Council, which helps refugees who had to flee the country because of Saddam. I went back to Iraq on a humanitarian mission on 7 April 2003, two days before the fall of the regime in Baghdad. We took humanitarian supplies, food, medicine and water to Basra.

Since then we have moved to the central and southern parts of the country, discussing with the poorest communities their most urgent needs. We have carried out scores of projects helping local clinics obtain medicines, fixing the schools, repairing water pipelines, putting in street lighting and so on.

We are also supporting families that are headed by women, and rehabilitating former political prisoners who have been deprived of any education, training or job opportunities. We are looking at the most vulnerable groups in the society and trying to create opportunities for them.

What has it been like for scientists in Iraq since the end of the war?

It has been very difficult for the whole population, but perhaps more so for the scientists. Saddam forced the majority of the competent scientists, professionals and technologists to work on his military programmes, to develop his weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological and nuclear. After the fall of the regime all these activities ceased, so most of these scientists have been left without jobs, even though some of them may still be paid salaries. There isn't any real work for them. It is hard for a scientist to sit around and do nothing. There are no facilities for them to work in. A primary task in the reconstruction is to rebuild those facilities and engage these scientists in a way that would really benefit the country and serve the people. I am sorry to say that there has not been much progress on this front.

Why did you turn down the opportunity to be Iraq's interim prime minister?

I was not assured of the full cooperation of the major political parties. Without that cooperation it would be impossible to put together an interim government that would effectively prepare for and carry out general elections. Since preparing for the first fair and free elections in the country was my prime consideration for the interim government, I decided I could not accept that responsibility.

Do you see yourself getting involved in Iraqi politics sometime in the future?

I do not see myself taking part in political activity as such. But if, after the elections, I am asked by the National Assembly to take up a responsibility that I consider being of service to the country, particularly in developing science and technology for reconstruction, then I might consider accepting that.

Now for the $64,000 question: do you think there were any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when the war started last year?

For all practical purposes, most of the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and facilities were dismantled and destroyed in the second half of the 1990s. This doesn't mean they were all completely destroyed. I had the impression from talking to people who were working in Iraq in the second half of the 1990s that there were small quantities left: vials of germs and quantities of culture media that could be used to resume production of biological warfare agents. Of course there was the know-how and the political will if Saddam had been given the chance.
 
	  	


Polio in Africa

West and central Africa is on the brink of the largest polio epidemic in recent years, international polio experts are warning.

The case of a child being paralysed by the disease on 20 May in the troubled Darfur region of Sudan was confirmed on Tuesday. This prompted an alert from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which consists of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, Rotary International and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The polio case is the first in Sudan for three years. And the wild poliovirus is spreading rapidly in the region. Five times as many children in west and central Africa have been paralysed by polio in 2004 than during the same time period in 2003.

"There is no question that the virus is spreading at an alarming pace," says David Heymann, the WHO's representative for polio eradication. "The fact that the Sudan is now re-infected is concrete evidence of the need to support a massive immunisation response right across west and central Africa."

He stresses: "At the beginning of 2003, only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa were polio endemic. Today, however, Africa accounts for nearly 90 per cent of the global polio burden, with children now paralysed in 10 previously polio-free countries across the continent."

Fears of a major epidemic have been fuelled by the spread of polio from Nigeria to previously polio-free countries. In October 2003, three regions in northern Nigeria suspended their polio immunisation programmes amid rumours that the vaccine was laced with reproductive hormones and HIV as part of a western plot to depopulate Africa.


High season

Following tests in November 2003, two of the states subsequently re-started their programmes (New Scientist, 18 November 2003). But the state of Kano announced only in May 2004 that it was resuming the programme with vaccines it had sourced from Indonesia (New Scientist, 18 May 2004). It is the epicentre of the outbreak, says WHO.

The virus in Darfur has been shown to be genetically linked to the poliovirus type endemic in northern Nigeria. Experts are now worried that a major epidemic could break out as autumn - the polio "high season" - approaches, leaving thousands of children paralysed.

"What this adds up to is a virus and an epidemic that is gathering speed rather than slowing down at the end of the low season," says Bruce Aylward, a WHO polio expert, according to AFP.


Especially vulnerable
 

Less than half of the children in the region are immunised against polio and many other diseases. Experts are recommending that 22 African countries hold massive, synchronised immunization campaigns in October and November to reach 74 million children.

Since the suspension of the campaigns in Nigeria, 197 Nigerian children have been paralysed by polio.

Polio has already been exported from Nigeria to numerous other African countries and fears it could reach Sudan prompted the addition of the polio vaccine to an ongoing measles immunisation campaign in Darfur.

Children in Darfur are especially vulnerable to disease because of malnourishment and being displaced from their homes. Over a million people have been forced from their homes by internal conflict in Sudan.

About Bessie Smith: Bessie Smith was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After becoming an orphan at a young age, Smith began singing on the street when she was nine. In 1912, she was hired by a touring vaudeville show to work as a dancer. Blues singer Ma Rainey was a singer in the show, and trained and guided Smith.

After returning from tour, Smith became the leading singer at the 81 Theater in Atlanta Georgia, which was part of the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA). She also began touring on the TOBA circuit.

Smith's talent was recognized when in 1923 she recorded her first record, "Down Hearted Blues". It was a huge success, selling 780,000 copies. Smith continued to record throughout the 1920s with such musicians as Fletcher Henderson, Louis Armstrong, Joe Smith, and Benny Goodman. Along with regular recordings, Smith also continued to perform on the road. In 1929, she received a part in the film St. Louis Blues.

However, the effects of the Depression on the recording industry and Smith's heavy drinking affected her career. . She began working toward making a comeback and started performing in shows and clubs again.

While Smith had become most known for her blues style, she also began to achieve success as a jazz singer. In 1935, she sang at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and later appeared in the Stars Over Broadway. However, her comeback was cut short when in 1937 she was killed in an automobile accident. At the time of her death, Smith had recorded over 200 recordings.




BRUSSELS When European leaders decided two and a half years ago to call their latest grand treaty a constitution, the idea was to sell an easy-to-understand concept, create a sense of unity and inject a dose of pan-European pride into the otherwise yawn-inspiring process of Continental integration.
.
And while that strategy has given comfort to some citizens in France and Germany, it has backfired among others, especially in Britain, and risks scuttling the whole project. The term constitution has proved far more loaded and emotional than anyone might have guessed when it was born at a leaders' meeting in Laeken, Belgium, in December 2001.
.
"The word constitution has very special and heavy connotations in some countries," said Peter Ludlow, chairman of EuroComment, a Brussels research organization. "It's very important that politicians don't play it up to be more than it is."
.
After agreeing to a final version of the text here late Friday, the European Union's 25 leaders face a long, uphill struggle to ratify the document at home. Conspicuously, many are back-peddling on the initial language and are beginning to call it a constitutional treaty rather than a constitution.
.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain hinted Sunday that his country's referendum on the question might not be held until 2006.
.
"There's no need to rush it," he said.
.
The union has a history of failed referendums on EU-related issues, notably in Denmark and Ireland, and a single "no" vote means the constitution will not come into force.
.
In addition to Britain, Denmark and Ireland, which have confirmed plans for referendums, half a dozen others including Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain appear likely to hold one.
.
In a sign of how bitter and divisive the referendum campaigns may turn out to be, Robert Kilroy-Silk, a former television talk-show host and current leader of the U.K. Independence Party, compared Blair to Neville Chamberlain, the prewar British leader who famously claimed in 1938 to have secured "peace in our time" with Nazi Germany.
.
"It's appeasement," Kilroy-Silk said Sunday. "There's Tony, he's waving a piece of paper, saying, 'It's O.K., I've only given a little bit away of our sovereignty.'
.
"In fact," he said, "this is the beginning of the end of Britain as a nation state governing itself."
.
Given that, largely on Britain's insistence, the constitutional compromise reached Friday retains vetoes in all sensitive areas from taxation to foreign policy, how have perceptions come to differ so starkly from the reality? Pro-European governments have mainly themselves to blame, analysts say. As with so many aspects of European policy, politicians have largely failed to explain to voters the constitution's substance. While easily available on the Internet, the draft text is relatively hard to come by on paper. That vacuum has been skillfully exploited by anti-European parties; their success in the European elections eight days ago made plain that people can get excited about Europe if they are engaged.
.
Blair said Sunday that the referendum was going to present "a fascinating political battle." So far, it has been a losing battle. A poll published in The Sunday Express newspaper said 57 percent of respondents said they would vote no to the constitution; 28 percent said they would vote yes; and 14 percent were undecided. The poll was conducted Friday and Saturday, with 580 voters taking part and a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
.
Beyond the politics of the constitution, there is also a debate among lawyers and officials whether the document is really a constitution or whether it is technically a treaty. Lawyers for the European Council, which groups EU governments, successfully advised leaders earlier this month that the constitution begin with a list of the heads of state in the traditional format of a treaty between governments.
.
The document does read like a citizens' charter in some sections, with declarations about citizens' rights and a list of freedoms. "Equality between men and women must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay," the constitution says. Everyone has the right to health care and workers have the right to strike, the document says under the heading of solidarity.
.
But legally speaking, many of the rights listed in the constitution are nothing more than suggestions and cannot be enforced in national courts because those areas of law remain the prerogative of countries, not the union itself.
.
This mitigates the notion of a "a constitution for European citizens," the words that leaders used when they commissioned the writing of the document in December 2001.
.
The document approved Friday, which would replace the European Union's complex web of treaties, creates the posts of European Union president and foreign minister and establishes a voting system weighted for population. Leaders cocooned in Brussels for the negotiations were ebullient after reaching a deal. The Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, who was chairman of the talks, called the constitution "a great achievement for Europe" and "a great achievement for all Europeans." President Jacques Chirac of France said the constitution would allow Europe to be more efficient in making decisions and "clearly make its voice heard in the world."
.
Leaders failed, however, to pick a successor to Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, the EU's executive board. Ahern said Friday he would continue discussions with leaders but wanted to find consensus on a candidate before July.

With all that Ethel Waters has contributed to music and film, it is surprising that she is often forgotten. She was a talented blues singer whose unique style distinguished her from other blues singers and she was a jazz vocalist as well. Her talent extended beyond singing, when she became a dramatic actress who earned award nominations for her performances. What was most remarkable about Waters' performances was how she reconstructed the mammy character into one that challenged stereotypes.

Career as a Singer

Ethel Waters was born in Chester, Pennsylvania on October 31, 1896. She had a hard life in which she faced rejection from her mother and poverty. Waters' love of singing began as a child when she sang in church choirs but her childhood was cut short when at thirteen she married an abusive man, dropped out of sixth grade, and was divorced a year later. Shortly thereafter, she began working as a maid until two vaudeville producers discovered her while she was singing in a talent contest in 1917. She toured with vaudeville shows, and was billed as "Sweet Mama Stringbean" because of her height and thinness. In 1919, she left the vaudeville circuit and performed in Harlem nightclubs. Two years later she became one of the first black singers to cut a record on the Black Swan Record label with her release of "Down Home Blues" and "Oh, Daddy".

The record was a success and Waters went on tour and received great acclaim.  She toured with Fletcher Henderson and the Black Swan Jazz Masters.  The Chicago Defender and other newspapers gave the tour substantial notoriety.  The tour increased Black Swan's revenues, and made Waters a top performer who became known for her shimmies and soft style of singing. 

Waters' success was related to her style of singing. She could sing like other classic blues singers with plenty of passion and fire, but she had a unique approach. She was not a shouter but was able to hold the attention of the audience with her low and sweet voice.  According to Jimmy McPartland, who saw her in the 1927 show Miss Calico,"We were enthralled with her.  We liked Bessie Smith very much, too, but Waters had more polish, I guess you' say.  She phrased so wonderfully, the natural quality of her voice was so fine . . ."(1) Waters introduced a new style of the blues, one that was influenced by her grandmother who always told her "You don't have to holler so. God has very big ears. He can hear you even if you whisper."(2)  Just the opposite, her mother's preference was more in line with the Holy Rollers and the Baptists style. Waters' style was a combination of both these approaches. The result was one that was characterized by sophistication, refinement, moderation, only rare growls, and precise enunciation.

Waters' unique style contributed her ability to sing various styles of music. Like other classic blues singers, she could sing torches, pop songs from Tin Pan Alley, vaudeville, and musical theatre tunes. Her style encompassed the use of wide vocal ranges and upbeat rhythmic renditions that were similar to vaudeville singing. According to Clyde Bernhardt, a jazz musician who saw her perform in 1921 at the Chestnut Auditorium in Pennsylvania, she could do the blues, a fast-tempo jazz song, and a ballad and make it sound beautiful.

Because of her varied repertoire, she has also been categorized as a jazz singer. Her rhythm was closer to jazz than blues and in her later career she sang popular songs with a jazz approach. Jazz critic, Hugues Panassie wrote that Waters was a great jazz singer. He praises her clear voice, her extensive range, the ease in which she sings, and the perfect tone of every note. He also claims that her influence on female jazz singers is "almost as great as that of Louis Armstrong."(3) She influenced such great singers as Billie Holiday who took songs from her repertoire and recorded them as "Billie's Blues" and Sophie Tucker who paid Waters to sing for her privately so that she could study her style.  Other admirers included Mildred Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, the Boswell Sisters, and Eartha Kitt.

Waters' talent extended beyond musical style, she also had the gift of interpretation.  She set a new standard with her rendition of "Stormy Weather"at the Cotton Club in 1933.  Waters changed the original interpretation of the ending and gave it a dramatic conclusion.  Her performance was unforgettable and was the talk of New York.   Her interpretive talent would not go to waste.  As blues women began to fade in popularity, Waters was able use her interpretive ability to take advantage of acting opportunities on stage and screen.




Intelligent, dedicated, charismatic, and religious, Martin Luther King, Jr. had what it took to inspire the conscience of the American public. He appealed to the moral sense of Americans, and after years of leading blacks in nonviolent protest and direct action, his leadership helped to desegregate the South.

Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia to Alberta Williams King and Martin Luther King, Sr., a minister. At a young age King excelled in school and went on to skip ninth and twelfth grade. When he was fifteen he enrolled at Morehouse College. He graduated in 1948 with a bachelor in Sociology. That same year he began attending Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. Among his studies, he took a particular interest in Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy.


In 1954, King became the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Shortly thereafter, on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested after she refused to give up her seat to a white patron on a Montgomery city bus. Based on Parks decision to contest the arrest, the Montgomery Improvement Association was founded in order organize the boycott of the city buses. The members of the association elected King as president.

During the boycott, King received numerous threats and his home bombed. King and his family were not harmed. After more than a year, the boycott ended when the United States Supreme Court affirmed the District Court order to desegregate the city buses.

After successfully navigating the Montgomery bus boycott, King and other ministers founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which served to organize civil rights events throughout the South.

In 1959, King furthered his knowledge of Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy when he visited India. Upon his return, King moved to Atlanta, Georgia to co-pastor with his father at Ebenezer Baptist Church. While a co-pastor, King also stayed involved with the SCLC. In October 1960, King participated in the student sit-in movement. King was arrested and sentenced to serve time in prison. His sentence received nationwide media attention. After President Dwight Eisenhower decided not to intervene, presidential candidate John F. Kennedy got involved, and King was released.

King continued to participate in nonviolent protest. King, A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and other civil rights leaders organized  It took place on August 28, 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial. At the march, King gave his famous "I have a dream" speech. More than 250,000 blacks and whites gathered while the speech was televised.

In 1963, King became Time magazine's Man of the Year and he received the Noble Peace Prize in 1964. This was also an important year for the civil rights movement. As the movement had garnered widespread support, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.

After 1965, disenfranchisement with King surfaced among blacks that became impatient with his method of nonviolent resistance. During the Selma, Alabama march for voting rights, opposition became more prevalent when the marchers, led by King, marched across the Pettus Bridge but stopped when confronted by a barricade of state troopers. King and the marchers kneeled, prayed, and then turned around. Radical blacks believed that King should have handled the situation differently. Furthermore, as the black power movement became stronger and as Malcolm X's message of Black Nationalism became more accepted by Northern urban blacks, King increasingly became a controversial figure.

Despite the growing dissatisfaction with King's tactics, he expanded his focus to include opposition to the Vietnam War. However, King's disagreement with the war led to strained relations with the Lyndon Johnson administration.

King also began focusing on the poor of all races. In the spring of 1968, in the midst of planning the Poor People's March on Washington, King left for Memphis, Tennessee to lead a strike of city sanitation workers. It was there that he delivered his last speech, "I've been to the mountaintop." The next day, on April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel, he was shot. He was 39 years old. A few months later, on June 8, 1968, James Earl Ray was arrested in London, England. Ray pled guilty and was sentenced to ninety-nine years in prison. 




 VLADIKAVKAZVLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AFP) Armed clashes erupted near Russia's separatist republic of Chechnya overnight as rebels stormed police targets in neighboring Ingushetia in brazen attacks that killed almost 50 people and wounded dozens, officials said.

Ingushetia's interior minister, Abukar Kostoyev, was among those killed, the Interfax news agency reported. The incursion was the most spectacular military operation by Chechen rebels outside the war-torn republic in years.

Forty-eight people, both civilians and policemen, were killed in the fighting, Interfax quoted an official with the local police as saying.

"Among the casualties are 18 policemen and 28 civilians," the Ingush interior ministry's top spokesman Yakhya Khadziyev said. He added that another 30 people had been wounded in the fighting.

The bodies of two dead rebels had been discovered and were being identified, the official said.

An unidentified official with the local police earlier said some 30 people were killed in the fighting.

Clashes between rebels and law enforcement authorities broke out in at least three towns in Ingushetia, which houses tens of thousands of refugees who fled the fighting in Chechnya and where many Chechen rebels have taken shelter.

Some 200 rebels were involved in the clashes with law enforcement authorities, Interfax quoted an official with the Ingush interior ministry as saying.

The fighters targeted police stations, government buildings and checkpoints in the towns of Nazran, Karabulak and Sleptsovsk during the raid, which witnesses told AFP began around 10:00 pm (1800 GMT) Monday.

"They tried to take over the interior ministry and several of the regional police stations," Umar Sapraviyev, an official with Ingushetia's representation in Moscow, told Moscow Echo radio.

Many of the rebels, who apparently moved onto their targets from Chechnya and the neighboring republic of North Ossetia, shouted "Allah-u-Akbar" (God is greatest), Ingushetiya.ru news site reported, quoting witnesses.

Terrified residents spent the night cowering in their homes to sounds of automatic gunfire, mortars, grenade launchers, and helicopters flying overhead, witnesses told AFP.

"Many people are panicked and want to leave as soon as morning comes," one Nazran resident told AFP by telephone during the night. "Some say they may even go back to Chechnya."

At one of the police stations, the Nazran ROVD, 30 officers were killed, Ingushetiya.ru reported, quoting an unnamed police officer.

Witnesses reported seeing a military vehicle column come under gunfire a few minutes after entering Ingushetia from the neighboring republic of North Ossetia.

Many of the wounded were taken to Ingushetia's main hospital.

"Among them are civilians and representatives of law enforcement agencies... there are those who are severely injured," Interfax quoted an unnamed hospital official as saying.

The battles had died down by early Tuesday as the rebels withdrew, though sporadic fighting continued, news reports said.

The fighters did take control of at least one of the police checkpoints that are ubiquitous in Ingushetia, RIA-Novosti reported, quoting a camera crew with NTV television that was stopped at the post by masked armed men.

"They pointed guns at us and ordered us to get out of the car," the news agency quoted an NTV reporter as saying.

"They said they were rebels," the reporter said, apparently referring to Chechen separatists, who have been fighting pro-Moscow forces in the region since the start of the current Russo-Chechen war in October 1999.

The crew saw several bodies in military uniforms lying near the checkpoint. "It looked like they were manning the checkpoint and were shot by the rebels," he said.

Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov announced a three-day mourning period beginning on Wednesday, Interfax reported.

"This was aimed at destabilizing the situation" in the region, Zyazikov said.

Chechnya's pro-Moscow interior minister blamed feared Chechen rebel commander Shamil Basayev for the attacks and vowed a tough response.

"We have information that Basayev may have planned this operation and his men carried it out," Ali Alkhanov said. "We will take all measures to defeat them."

Russia poured tens of thousands of troops into Chechnya in October 1999 in what was supposed to be a lightning-strike anti-terror operation.

The Kremlin insists that the war has effectively ended and the situation in the ravaged republic has normalized. But a guerrilla war that claims lives on nearly a daily basis belies such claims.

	 
   QINGDAO, China (AFP) Twenty-two Asian foreign ministers met in China with the need for a regional energy policy high on their agenda because of soaring global oil prices.

They were to end their talks later in the day by issuing a so-called Qingdao Initiative -- named after the eastern port city where the gathering took place -- outlining strategies for supplying the energy-hungry region.

"Enhanced energy cooperation is necessary to safeguard Asian energy security and promote economic development in our countries," Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said at the opening of the meeting.

"Therefore, the Chinese government is actively pushing for the publication of the Qingdao Initiative," he said.

The Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), created two years ago on a Thai initiative, was being held outside Thailand for the first time, with the region's second-largest economy offering itself as an eager host.

With a roaring economy expanding nearly 10 percent in the first quarter, China has pushed up prices on key commodities in recent months and is now the world's second-largest importer of oil.

Despite China's voracious appetite, Wen sought to reassure that his country would have no crushing impact on the energy market.

"Since China has a large population and its economy has sustained rapid growth, its energy production and consumption have kept increasing," he said.

"We will mainly rely on the development of domestic resources and step up the development and utilization of coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear energy and various types of new energy," he said.

The Qingdao Initiative, addressing concerns like these, would mark an "important step forward" in energy security in the region, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri said.

According to the state-run China Daily newspaper, the ACD is proposing an energy forum to regularly discuss key aspects, such as developing better energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and infrastructure networks.

Han Wenke, an energy researcher at China's National Development and Reform Commission, told the paper such a forum was sorely needed.

"Although many projects are still in their conceptual stages, Asian countries have more and more recognized the urgency for establishing an organizational structure for cooperation in the power sector," Han said.

Long Yongtu, a former Chinese deputy foreign trade minister, said the rest of the world would not have to fear the emergence of a closed "Fortress Asia" in the energy markets.

"Regional cooperation in Asia is a cooperation open to the world," he told reporters. "We can't create a kind of regional group that is closed to the outside world."

Given growing Chinese clout, much of the conference has been spent soothing regional fears about what a strong China would mean for them.

"China will never seek hegemony," Wen said. "We will continue to value and support the Asia Cooperation Dialogue."

On Monday, on the sidelines of the ACD meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing met his colleagues from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is becoming increasingly jittery at the rise of their giant neighbor to the north.

"The Chinese side reaffirmed its support for ASEAN's role as the major driving force in East Asia cooperation," the ministers said in a release after their talks.

The lofty goal of the ACD is to "ultimately transform the Asian continent into an Asian community, capable of interacting with the rest of the world on a more equal footing", according to the Thai foreign ministry.






IHT, Mon June, 21.

 in Memphis, Tennessee, to the Church of God in Christ demonstrated, former President Bill Clinton is capable of soaring eloquence and visionary thinking. But as those who heard his deadening speech nominating Michael Dukakis at the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta well know, he is also capable of numbing, self-conscious garrulity.
.
Unfortunately for the reader, Clinton's much-awaited new autobiography "My Life" more closely resembles the Atlanta speech, which was so long-winded and tedious that the crowd cheered when he finally reached the words "In closing ..."
.
The book, which weighs in at more than 950 pages, is sloppy, self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull - the sound of one man prattling away, not for the reader, but for himself and some distant recording angel of history. In many ways, the book is a mirror of Clinton's presidency: lack of discipline leading to squandered opportunities; high expectations, undermined by self-indulgence and scattered concentration.
.
This memoir, published by Alfred A. Knopf, underscores many strengths of Clinton's eight years in the White House and his understanding that he was governing during a transitional and highly polarized period. But the very lack of focus and order that mars these pages also prevented him from summoning his energies in a sustained manner to bring his insights about the growing terror threat and an Israeli-Palestinian settlement to fruition.
.
Certainly it is easy enough to understand the huge advance sales for the book. Clinton would seem to have all the gifts for writing a gripping memoir: gifts of language, erudition and charm, combined with a policy wonk's perception of a complex world at a hinge moment in time, teetering on the pivot between cold war assumptions and a new era of global interdependence. Add to that, his improbable life story - a harrowing roller-coaster ride of precocious achievements, self-inflicted slip-ups and even more startling comebacks - and you have all the ingredients for a compelling book.
.
But while the CBS anchor Dan Rather, who interviewed Clinton for "60 Minutes," already compared the book to the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, arguably the most richly satisfying autobiography by an American president, "My Life" has little of that classic's unsparing candor or historical perspective. Instead, it devolves into a hodgepodge of jottings: part policy primer, part 12-step confessional, part stump speech and part presidential archive, all, it seems, hurriedly written and even more hurriedly edited.
.
There are endless litanies of meals eaten, speeches delivered, voters greeted and turkeys pardoned for Thanksgiving. There are some fascinating sections about Clinton's efforts to negotiate a Middle East peace agreement (at one point, he suggests that Yasser Arafat seemed confused, not fully in command of the facts and possibly no longer at the top of his game), but there are also tedious descriptions of long-ago political debates in Arkansas over utility regulation and car license fees. There are some revealing complaints about missteps at the FBI under Louis Freeh's watch, but there are also dozens of pointless digressions about matters like zombies in Haiti and ruins in Pompeii.
.
Clinton confesses that his affair with Monica Lewinsky was "immoral and foolish," but he spends far more space excoriating his nemesis, the independent counsel Kenneth Starr, and the press.
.
Part of the problem, of course, is that Clinton is concerned, here, with cementing - or establishing - his legacy, while at the same time boosting (or at least not undermining) the political career of his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. He does a persuasive job of explicating his more successful initiatives like welfare reform and deficit reduction, but the failure of his health care initiative, overseen by Hillary Clinton, is quickly glossed over, as is the subsequent focus of his administration on such small-bore initiatives as school uniforms and teenage smoking.
.
Clinton takes more responsibility in these pages for his affair with Lewinsky, his lies about that affair and the damage those actions inflicted on his family and his presidency than he has in the past. But he still spends a lot of time - like his wife did in her book - assailing rightist enemies for his woes over Whitewater, the Paula Jones case and impeachment. In the end, he says, what brought him and his wife back together was weekly counseling sessions and their shared determination "to fight off the right-wing coup."
.
In one passage, Clinton tries to characterize his impeachment fight as "my last great showdown with the forces I had opposed all of my life" - with those who had defended segregation in the South, opposed the women's and gay rights movements, and who believed government should be run for the benefit of special interests. He adds that he is glad he had "the good fortune to stand against this latest incarnation of the forces of reaction and division."
.
In comparison to these self-serving, often turgid attempts to defend his reputation, Clinton's account of his youth in Arkansas possesses a pleasing emotional directness.
.
His portraits of life in the raffish Hot Springs and the more sedate Hope (Arkansas towns that would became the polestars of his Janus-faced personality, what political guru Dick Morris once called "Saturday Night Bill" and "Sunday Morning Clinton") may lack the raw energy of his mother Virginia Kelley's reminiscences, set down in her 1994 book "Leading With My Heart," but he does provide the reader with some telling snapshots of his awkward childhood: a fat, self-conscious boy dressed in a new Easter outfit every year - including, one year, pink and black Hush Puppies and a matching pink suede belt; breaking his leg trying to jump rope wearing cowboy boots; devouring books about Geronimo and Crazy Horse at the local library.
.
Looking back on those days of living with a violent, abusive stepfather, Clinton writes like someone familiar with therapeutic tropes. He writes that seeing his stepfather angry and drunk, he came to associate anger with being out of control, and determined to keep his own anger locked away. He writes about experiencing a "major spiritual crisis" at the age of 13, when he found it difficult to sustain a belief in God in the face of his family's difficulties.
.
For the most part, the self-portrait that emerges from this book is not all that different a Bill Clinton from the one the public has already come to know: tireless, driven, boyish, self-absorbed and optimistic, someone riven by contradictions but adept at compartmentalizing different parts of his life.America's first baby-boomer president always seemed like an avatar of his generation, defined by the struggles of the '60s and Vietnam, comfortable in the use of touchy-feely language, and intent on demystifying his job. And yet the former president's 957-page account of his life, read in this post-9/11 day, feels strangely like an artifact from a distant, more innocent era.

IHT,june,20.
 
BRUSSELS The NATO summit meeting in Istanbul at the end of June will cap a month of high level international meetings that began with the D-Day commemorations. Iraq has been on the agenda of all of these, as it will be in Istanbul.
.
Our NATO summit meeting takes place only days before the Iraqi interim government assumes authority and responsibility for Iraq's future. It will be for that government to decide to what extent and in what form Iraq might call upon the international community, including NATO, for assistance.
.
Currently NATO is supporting the Polish-led division in Iraq, and many North Atlantic allies have troops on the ground in a national capacity. UN Security Council Resolution 1546 reflects the international community's resolve to support the interim government. It makes sense for NATO to discuss whether the allies could play a further role if asked to do so.
.
I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of such a discussion at the Istanbul summit meeting. However it is clear to me that the entire international community has a profound interest in ensuring that the new Iraq finds it feet. The price of failure is simply too high.
.
The same applies to the other key challenge we will also discuss in Istanbul, an issue which has been my first priority since taking office in January - helping to build a new future for Afghanistan. As in Iraq, we cannot afford to let Afghanistan fail.
.
NATO is already playing its part, mainly by helping to keep the peace in the capital. At Istanbul, I am confident that the heads of state and government, alongside President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, will confirm that NATO will expand its peacekeeping mission beyond Kabul by bringing more provincial reconstruction teams under NATO command. In doing so, they will illustrate NATO's effectiveness at building security where it is needed today - just as the alliance is doing in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean.
.
Afghanistan is not only an immediate challenge. It is also an example of the new kinds of operations this alliance must be prepared to face - largely unforeseen, far from our traditional areas of operation, and a test of our collective ability to contribute to peace when and where we must.
.
That is why in Istanbul I intend to put some fresh thoughts before the NATO leaders on matching our grasp with our reach. Should NATO own and operate certain key assets, beyond AWACS? Can we take a longer horizon for our force planning, which includes better preparation for new operations? What new steps can we take to make sure that our political commitments are matched by resources?
.
We must prepare the alliance for the future. Our heads of state and government will put into action a plan for NATO to acquire cutting-edge technologies to defend against terrorism. They will deepen NATO's partnerships with the strategically important regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. And they will endorse a change in our relations with the six Arab nations and Israel in our Mediterranean Dialogue toward substantive, practical partnership.
.
In Istanbul, I am confident that we will also open up, for the first time, a security dialogue with the broader region of the Middle East. This dialogue must be, and will be, a two-way street. Such a bridge of open consultation will only be strong if it is built and maintained by all the participants together. And if it succeeds over time in breaking down stereotypes and fostering trust, our Istanbul Cooperation Initiative has the potential to make a real contribution to enhancing our common security.
.
Istanbul marks another major step forward for the Atlantic alliance. It will confirm NATO's role as an indispensable peacekeeper in new theaters. It will enhance our ability to shape change and build peace through dialogue and cooperation. Istanbul will continue the modernization of NATO's capability to take on the most demanding missions of the 21st century.
.
While NATO's transformation continues, its fundamental purpose endures as a vital instrument for Europe and North America to defend peace, democracy and stability in, and increasingly beyond, the Euro-Atlantic area, now and into the future.
.
Jaap de Hoop Scheffer is secretary general of NATO.




IHT, JUNE,20.


TOKYO A powerful storm lashed western Japan with heavy rains and strong winds on Monday, grounding airplanes and forcing hundreds to evacuate their homes after leaving three people dead over the weekend.
.
The three drowned as the typhoon approached Japan's main islands, and two other people were missing. Seven people were injured Monday, according to the National Police Agency.
.
Early Monday, the Meteorological Agency classified the storm, called Dianmu, or "Mother of Lightning" in Mandarin Chinese, as "large and very powerful" and warned that it could dump up to 400 millimeters, or 16 inches, of rain on Osaka and the surrounding area over the next day.
.
But Dianmu gradually lost power and became a tropical storm, packing sustained winds of 108 kilometers, or 67 miles, per hour as it traveled northeast, the agency said.
.
At midday Monday, the storm was centered near Akashi, about 435 kilometers west of Tokyo.
.
Typhoons generally hit Japan during August and September, and it is rare for them to make their way across the archipelago in June. The public broadcaster, NHK, said that more than 100 flights had been canceled throughout western Japan and that ferry service across the region had been suspended. About 720 people had to evacuate their homes, while nearly 27,000 households lost electric power in western Japan. The National Police Agency said seven people were injured, mostly hit by flying objects or swept over in strong wind.In Owase, about 370 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, an innkeeper fell from a roof while fixing a television antenna and broke his wrists. A woman was hit by a flying tin roof panel and suffered a minor head injury.
.
On Sunday, police in Shizuoka, 150 kilometers west of Tokyo, found the bodies of two college students believed to have been swept out by rough seas during a beach barbecue on Saturday. A 32-year-old man died while sailboarding in high waves off southern Okinawa island. Authorities were looking for a Tokyo resident, Seiji Ikeda, 73, who disappeared after he went fishing south of Tokyo on Friday. They were also searching for a 19-year-old man reported missing in waters off western Wakayama.

    The launching of Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, was the most significant event during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. This scientific breakthrough was the greatest accomplishment of the century, assuring the American people that the US was superior in their technology as well as their defense weapons. Until Apollo 11, America was losing "the Space Race" to the Soviet Union.

    On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first satellite into space. A month later the Soviets launched Sputnik II containing the first living creature, a dog named Laika, thus pushing the Russians to a commanding lead in the beginning of an international space exploration battle.

    The United States began to panic. The Gallup polls found that half of all Americans believed the Soviets held the lead "in the development of missiles and long-distance rockets (Bates)." By early 1958, more than a third of Americans thought that the Soviets "could wipe out most cities in the United States in a matter of a few hours with their new rockets and missiles" (Bates). One out of three Americans also expected the outbreak of World War III by the early 1960's. President Eisenhower remained calm throughout the whole panic although he faced attacks on the US's military system and the "deficient" education system. Life magazine devoted five issues to the "Crisis in Education," arguing in one article that the spartan Soviet system was producing students better equipped to cope with the Space Age. Books such as "Why Johnny Can't Read", explaining Americans' ineptness in education, reached the top of the bestseller list.

    Ten years later, the Americans launched their first manned mission to the moon in Apollo 11. Apollo's crew consisted of Commander Neil Armstrong, pilot Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin Jr., and pilot Michael Collins. The space craft consisted of a lunar module, called the "Eagle", and the command module and service module, which linked together to form "Columbia" (the command service module). Two hours and thirty-three minutes after takeoff, the spacecraft broke free from earth's orbit and began circling the moon. Each orbit of the moon took two hours. The lunar module and the command service module separated, sending the two astronauts in the LM to the lunar surface at the Sea of Tranquility, leaving the third pilot in lunar orbit in the command module. The Eagle landed on the moon 102 hours, 45 minutes, and 4 seconds after launching from earth; on July 20th. Armstrong emerged from the spacecraft first and released a surface television to record mankind's first steps on the moon. A plaque affixed to the leg of the lunar landing vehicle, signed by President Nixon and the three crew members, read "HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON JULY 1969 AD WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND." Scientific studies were performed, and soil and rock samples were acquired by the astronauts during this first "moonwalk." After roughly two and a quarter hours, the men returned to the lunar module and returned to earth, splashing into the Pacific Ocean on July 24th.

    With this eight-day lunar trip, the Americans triumphed over the Soviet Union in the space race by walking on the moon. This event proved to be one of the biggest steps in America's efforts to rebuild confidence in the US's scientific and militaristic abilities.






IHT, June,20.

LONDON The guitar strains of Buddy Holly's "It's So Easy to Fall in Love" jangled through a London auditorium last week as Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer, introduced the company's iTunes online music service to Europe.
.
The recording industry, which resisted selling music via the Internet until it got jilted by consumers, now embraces iTunes and a bevy of other legitimate services. It sees them as the best hope for fighting file-sharing, which provides no-cost access to millions of recordings at the click of a mouse.
.
Swirling around the new competition in digital music are questions about who owns what, when and where on the Internet, and how - or even whether - they should pay for it.
.
How the music business resolves such questions is likely to set the pattern for the distribution of movies and other media, analysts say, as high-speed Internet access spreads and mobile phones provide continuous access.
.
"Music was the first entertainment industry to go into that dark file-sharing tunnel, so we've taken all the early bruises," said Dan Whiley, business development director at Universal Music eLabs. "Maybe we're first out of the tunnel, and maybe our solutions will set some precedents for other industries which depend on copyright and intellectual property."
.
The competition among online music services pits the titans of the technology world against each other, including Jobs at Apple and Bill Gates at Microsoft, but ordinary Web surfers probably hold the keys. Getting them to fall in love with these new offerings may prove anything but easy.
.
Consider people like Afua, a 22-year-old Londoner who uses Internet file-sharing services to discover new music. She said she had heard about the legitimate online sites but was skeptical about their appeal.
.
"Why would I pay for something I can get for free?" she said, adding that her 18-year-old sister and her friends, being short on cash, are even more avid users of file-sharing networks.
.
"The younger generation is incredibly computer-literate," she said.
.
The fact that young people today see a four-year age gap as an entire generation says a lot about the pace of technological change in the digital era.
.
In roughly that amount of time, the music industry went from its highest-ever sales to one of its worst slumps as it tried to protect the CD instead of embracing the Internet. Global sales of recorded music fell to $32 billion in 2003 from $40 billion in 1999, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries, as buyers defected first to sites like Napster, then to peer-to-peer services such as Kazaa.
.
"Young people have grown up expecting online music to be free," said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Jupiter Research in London. "That isn't going to change overnight. But European consumers finally have a choice of compelling, competing services."
.
Apple's introduction of iTunes in Britain, France and Germany last week, more than a year after it opened for business in the United States, was the highest-profile event yet for the nascent European market in legitimate online music services.
.
It was preceded in Britain by the start of a legal version of the once-notorious Napster in May. Napster has said it will expand to the Continent later this year. Meanwhile, Sony plans to start its Connect service in Britain, France and Germany this month.
.
A British company called On Demand Distribution, or OD2, which was co-founded by the singer Peter Gabriel in 1999, was the pioneer among European online services. While it has no consumer presence of its own, it is the backbone for a number of online music sites fronted by better-known brands like Coca-Cola and Microsoft's MSN.
.
With bigger American rivals entering its turf, OD2 has been looking for a financial backer. People close to the company say a partnership, or even an outright sale, could be announced as soon as Monday.
.
Another company that is expected to enter the European online music market this year is RealNetworks, which operates the Rhapsody service in the United States and provides audio- and video-playing software. Matthew Graves, a spokesman, said, "As an international company, we're always looking for opportunities."
.
The music industry federation estimates that there are now more than 50 online music retailers operating in Europe, out of a total of more than 100 worldwide, though most of those in Europe are powered by OD2.
.
But competition and choice bring new complications. Analysts say the rivals could turn off consumers with an array of incompatible technologies and sometimes incomplete product offerings.
.
Jobs, for instance, has rebuffed overtures to make iTunes compatible with competing audio formats, as Apple seeks to drive sales of its sleek iPod portable music player. The marketing appeal of the iPod has helped iTunes grab an early lead in the U.S. market, and it claims about 70 percent of the market for legal downloads.
.
But in Europe, as in the United States, Apple enters a market where Microsoft has a strong position. Its Windows Media 9 software is used by OD2, Napster and other services and is compatible with more than 70 portable music players now on the market - though not the iPod.
.
MSN offers a retail music site in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, using OD2's "digital jukebox" offering; it is expanding into Belgium and Spain this summer. Although MSN is building on its own site in the United States, it has no plans to do so at the moment in Europe, said Geoff Sutton, the MSN general manager in Europe.
.
"They have the rights, and that's obviously attractive," he said of OD2.
.
Microsoft this year lost an antitrust case in the European Union over the inclusion of its Media Player jukebox software in Windows to the detriment of rivals like RealNetworks and Apple. The company is appealing the decision.
.
Analysts say that if the rivals choose to battle it out over formats and technology - rather than solve their differences by cross-licensing - they risk losing the bigger struggle against piracy.
.
When consumers download illegally from the Internet, they do not have to choose among competing formats, after all. And their actions are not controlled by "digital rights management" software, which the legitimate services employ to enable consumers to download a purchased track while limiting the number of times it can be copied onto CDs or portable devices.
.
Charles Grimsdale, chief executive of OD2, said last week at a news conference that he thought interoperability with Apple would be negotiated within "12 to 18 months."
.
Sony, meanwhile, backs its own competing technology. Though it has said it will start Connect in Europe by the end of the month, the introduction will be low-key, and Sony will delay the introduction if it means "compromising on quality," said Gregor Erkel, Sony Europe's director of online music services. He said Sony planned to tailor its offerings for the French, German and British markets, where domestically focused music can sometimes make up as much as 40 percent of sales.
.
Marketing and pricing could prove equally tricky. The lack of a pan-European system for collecting and distributing royalties to artists delayed the start of the online services, particularly to smaller Continental markets. It also has kept prices higher than in the United States, though they are falling as competition heats up and Apple arrives with an offering of 99 euro cents, or $1.20, per downloaded track.
.
But iTunes, rivals note, requires a credit card for payment, which could be a barrier to acceptance in places like Germany, where relatively few people use them. Some rivals accept payment in a variety of ways, including billing to customers' mobile phone bills.
.
Mobile phones also present possibilities for distribution of music, particularly as advanced new wireless networks are brought on line across Europe. Already sales of ring tones for mobile phones, which chime away to the melodies of hit songs, are a significant business.
.
Mobile downloading of actual recorded music is a business still in its infancy. But impulse buying of individual tracks might seem like the perfect market for European mobile phone users, who often seem as enamored of their handsets as they are of their favorite musicians.
.
Mobile downloads will remain relatively expensive, analysts say, as fees will have to cover not only rights paid to recording companies but also the cost of a data "call" - which with current GPRS, or general packet radio service, networks can take four minutes or more.
.
That would be one obvious example of the digital "convergence" that technology soothsayers have promised for years. But it could be only a start, if the digital music ventures now under way serve as a model for other media.
.
Sony, for instance, is looking at a variety of video and mobile services that could be used in conjunction with Connect, Erkel said. "This is only the nucleus," he said.
.

The invasion of Panama in 1989 was known as Operation JUST CAUSE. Its key objectives were the capture of Manuel Noriega and the establishment of a democratic government. Noriega was the Panamanian leader who US officials had indicted on drug trafficking charges.1 With the transfer of the Canal Zone from US to Panama approaching, the US government wanted to make sure Panama was in the hands of people they could control. Many believe that Noriega's illegal operations were known long before, but it had not been in the interest of the US to get rid of him. However, when he suddenly withdrew his support, the US pressed charges.2    

     First, a military coup was tried but failed. On December 20, 1989, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, an aerial bombardment burst upon Panama's sleeping cities. In this surprise and forceful attack, the US military hit 27 targets in densely populated areas. Thousands of Panamanians, especially those in poor slum areas, were killed, injured, or lost their homes. This was unlike a typical military action where civilian areas were avoided.  At the time, it was the largest US military action since the Viet Nam War.

    Media coverage of the invasion was marked by significant misrepresentation.  Destruction caused by the military was underreported.   The US media tended to interview upper middle class, English-speaking Panamanian whose lives had not been disrupted and destroyed by the attack and siege of the country.3  According to them, the operation was a success and of great benefit to Panama.  The US government was happy that the rich white elite was back in control.  It has been overthrown by Omar Torrijo, Noriega's predecessor. This small group of people was much more ready to cooperate with the US officials in their best interests.

    Upon his capture, Manuel Noriega was sentenced to 40 years in a US federal prison for drug racketeering, money laundering and drug trafficing.



 
ROME In the days and weeks leading to the Italian Parliament's August recess, a battle raged in Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's governing coalition that posed the greatest threat yet to his hold on power.
.
The near-collapse suggested that Berlusconi's three years in office, the very accomplishment he boasts of most, had dulled his luster and worn thin his onetime invulnerability.
.
Coalition partners hungry for more clout after relatively strong showings in June's local elections were also fed up with years of undelivered promises. Italians tired of economic slumps and his international gaffes wanted to see some change.
.
Yet many analysts say that Berlusconi's present stint, the longest in Italy's postwar era, represents in itself the greatest change and contribution to a country marred by ceaseless government turnover. The prime minister's uncanny survival instincts and political acumen have granted Italy a taste of relative stability.
.
"Stability is an important value," said Roberto D'Alimonte, a professor of political science at the University of Florence. "And there is some virtue to the chance of voting on an incumbent prime minister. It increases accountability."
.
But critics refused to give high grades for attendance alone. They cast Berlusconi as a disappointing student, too often distracted from his homework by poorly behaving friends and a host of extracurricular activities. He even had to resort to last-minute cramming to squeak through to summer recess.
.
Berlusconi indeed seemed anxious to get to summer break. After skillfully quashing lingering gripes in his coalition and using risky confidence votes to push through pension and budget reforms, he told reporters, "Now I can go on vacation in peace."
.
Confidence votes ensure discipline from disgruntled coalition partners because a loss forces the collapse of the government. So many political analysts saw those successful efforts to rush legislation onto the books as a sign of Berlusconi's desperation.
.
"Berlusconi was running out of time; he had to deliver," D'Alimonte said. "Confidence votes are a shortcut." The Italian opposition argues that Berlusconi, who is a media mogul and the country's richest man, wasted too much of his first years in power dwelling on his own personal interests rather than tackling difficult social reforms.
.
They claim that Berlusconi passed a dearth of important legislation until last month's flurry of activity and charge that he was too preoccupied with enacting laws to help him slip out of legal troubles or expand his business empire.
.
"We spent most of these three years dealing with tailor-made bills," said Paolo Gentiloni, a center-left member of Parliament. "The result is that his business is in really good shape, but the country is not."
.
Berlusconi's supporters contend that those laws benefit all. They point out that they have passed the first substantial reform to Italy's schools in ages, have pushed ahead on many enormous public works projects and reformed the country's rigid labor markets.
.
"We have a lot of results that other governments have not achieved," said Paolo Bonaiuti, Berlusconi's spokesman.
.
But a deep division in Berlusconi's coalition between those who want to help their electoral bases in the country's wealthy north or poorer south has paralyzed Berlusconi's far-reaching campaign promises.
.
"There is a gap between his political force and electoral plan," said Angelo Panebianco, a political science professor at the University of Bologna, who added that a bickering coalition was nevertheless better than a collapsed one.
.
Italy has had more than 50 governments since World War II, and tiny parties wield disproportionate amounts of power inside fractious and fragile coalitions. That leads to constant appeasement and little social reform, which many say is at the heart of the country's current economic problem.
.
There is hope that this government's stability could eventually help create something closer to a manageable two-party system.
.
Yet D'Alimonte warned: "Stability is not good per se. You have to use it to make good laws." Berlusconi's advisers said they had done just that, and cited what they call a positive influence outside Italy's borders. Berlusconi has forged close relationships with Presidents George W. Bush of the United States and Vladimir Putin of Russia, and he claims to have put Italy back on the map of geopolitical importance with his staunch support of the war in Iraq.
.
"He has been revolutionary in foreign policy, pro-U.S. in Iraq and pro -Israel. That's an interruption in a longer Italian continuity," said Giuliano Ferrara, a friend of Berlusconi's who edits Il Foglio, a conservative newspaper. "He introduced personality and a no-shame-of-money approach to politics." But Ferrara acknowledged that the prime minister's ownership of television channels, publishing houses and advertising firms created an anomalous conflict of interest that, when compounded by a series of international gaffes, exposed a less flattering aspect of that personality.
.
In three years Berlusconi has compared a German member of European Parliament to a Nazi and invited the New York Stock Exchange to invest in Italy because it had beautiful secretaries. He has disappeared from the political scene to get a face-lift, and reappeared in the pages of his wife's authorized biography as "not a man ready to confront reality."
.
While his supporters discard those examples as trivial, they admit his coalition travails have proved more serious. This summer all three of his major partners threatened to quit as the economic deficit ballooned.
.
But Berlusconi, the consummate wheeling-and-dealing mediator, found a compromise that gave his government a new lease on life.
.
Not everyone was so sure how long it would last. "What we're seeing," said Gentiloni, the Parliament member, "is the power of what we Italians call 'General August': He overcomes all political turmoil because everyone wants to go on vacation. The problems will be back and more serious in September."

Iran and North Korea continue work, despite months of diplomatic pressure
 
KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine American intelligence officials and outside nuclear experts have concluded that the Bush administration's diplomatic efforts with European and Asian allies have barely slowed the nuclear weapons programs in Iran and North Korea over the past year, and that both have made significant progress.
.
In a tacit acknowledgment that the diplomatic initiatives with European and Asian allies have failed to slow the programs, senior administration and intelligence officials say they are seeking ways to step up unspecified covert actions intended, in the words of one official, "to disrupt or delay as long as we can" Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
.
But other experts, including former Clinton administration officials, caution that while covert efforts have been tried in the past, both the Iranian and North Korean programs are increasingly self-sufficient, largely thanks to the aid they received from the network built by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the former leader of the Pakistani bomb program.
.
"It's a much harder thing to accomplish today," said one senior American intelligence official, "than it would have been in the '90s."
.
Khan's efforts have also worked against the Bush administration in North Korea. A new assessment of North Korea has come in one of three classified reports commissioned by the Bush administration earlier this year from the American intelligence community.
.
Circulated last month, the report concluded that nearly 20 months of toughened sanctions, including ending a major energy program, and several rounds of negotiations involving four of North Korea's neighbors had not slowed the North's efforts to develop plutonium weapons, and that a separate, parallel program to make weapons from highly enriched uranium was also moving forward, though more slowly.
.
The desire to pursue a broader strategy against Iran's nuclear ambitions is driven in part, officials say, by increasingly strong private statements by Israeli officials that they will not tolerate the development of an Iranian nuclear weapon and may be forced to consider military action similar to the attack against a nuclear reactor in Iraq two decades ago if Tehran is judged to be on the verge of making a weapon.
.
In contrast, North Korea's neighbors are seeking stability first and disarmament as a longer-term goal, diplomats from the region say.
.
"The evidence suggests that Iran is trying to keep all of its options open," said Robert Gates, the director of central intelligence under President George H.W. Bush.
.
Gates recently headed a detailed study of Iran that was critical of what it called the administration's failure to engage the country.
.
"They are trying to stay just within their treaty obligations" while producing highly enriched uranium, said Gates, "and I think they can go with a weapon whenever they want to."
.
Over the past few weeks, five senior officials from the administration and Asian and European nations, with varying access to the intelligence about the Iranian and North Korean programs, were interviewed about the status of those programs. Not surprisingly, their judgments about the progress the two countries have made were not always in accord.
.
The new report on North Korea, which has circulated among senior U.S. officials and been described to some allies and to The New York Times, appears to have been written far more cautiously than the National Intelligence Estimate that erroneously described advanced weapons programs in Iraq. It describes in detail vast gaps in American knowledge. For example, it acknowledges that the whereabouts of North Korea's stockpile of more than 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods has been a mystery since early 2003, but also concludes that the North has had plenty of time to reprocess the rods into enough fuel for six to eight additional weapons. North Korea is judged to have two to six weapons already. For its part, Iran has begun to assemble the necessary ingredients and perhaps the same crude, Chinese-origin bomb design that the Khan network sold to Libya - and may be just a few years away, intelligence experts have said. Taken together, the intelligence conclusions pose both security and political challenges for President George W. Bush.
.
Bush has said he would not "tolerate" either country becoming a nuclear power, ignoring, at least publicly, the near certainty that North Korea has already reached that status. But he has never defined that term, or set deadlines for progress. He is already under attack by the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John Kerry, for allowing both countries to spring forward in their programs while the White House concentrated on the one member of the "axis of evil," Iraq, which turned out to have virtually no evidence of a continuing program.
.
Bush has said little about the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs in recent months, in sharp contrast to his regular recitations about the danger posed by Iraq in the period before the war last year.
.
"It's very frustrating," said one former official who left the Bush administration recently and who believes that the administration has failed to draw clear "red lines" beyond which North Korea would not be allowed to expand its arsenal. The official noted that Bush and his aides have been talking as if North Korea and Iran would follow the model of Libya, which disarmed earlier this year in an effort to reintegrate its economy with the West. But, the official argued, Iran does not need to do that because it has robust trade with Europe, and North Korea still receives considerable aid from China.
.
On July 31, Iran announced that it was resuming the production of centrifuges needed to produce highly enriched uranium, though it said it was still "suspending" actual enrichment activities. While the United States has threatened to take the issue to the UN Security Council, it has yet to win support from many allies.
.
North Korea has publicly rejected a new U.S. initiative to allow international aid to flow gradually to the country in return for speedy disarmament and giving inspectors the right to examine any suspected site.
.
Several of Bush's aides have said they expect little concrete progress before the presidential election. The Iranians appear to be betting that Kerry, if elected, would talk directly to their leaders.
.
The New York Times 
Rice says world watches Iran
.
The U.S. national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said Sunday that the world finally was "worried and suspicious" over the Iranians' intentions and was determined not to let Tehran produce a nuclear weapon, The Associated Press reported from Washington.
.
Rice also said the Bush administration had seen a new international willingness to act against Iran's nuclear program. She credited the changed attitude to the Americans' insistence that Iran's effort has put the world in peril.

Nuclear proliferation
 
While unexpected, the decision by the Bush administration last month to oppose inspections and verification as part of the Fissile Materials Cutoff Treaty is not surprising. Since taking office, the administration has taken a number of steps that have undermined the ability of the United States and the world community to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
.
But given the fact that Bush agrees with most analysts that the greatest danger facing the United States is a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of a rogue state or terrorist group, his actions are counterproductive and defy good sense.
.
The fissile materials cutoff would ban the production of enriched uranium and plutonium, the two ingredients used for setting off a chain reaction nuclear explosion. It was designed to reinforce the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and impose restraints on the three nuclear powers which are not parties to that treaty.
.
By refusing to establish an inspection regime for the fissile materials cutoff, the Bush administration has thwarted a 10-year effort by the international community to lure Pakistan, India and Israel into accepting some oversight of their nuclear production programs.
.
The Nonproliferation Treaty strikes a grand bargain among the five declared nuclear powers and the rest of the world that the non-nuclear states will not develop nuclear weapons, in return for which the nuclear powers will reduce and eventually eliminate their own nuclear weapons.
.
Since coming into office, the Bush administration has undermined this reciprocal arrangement in a variety of ways, despite the fact that it could make America safer and more secure.
.
First, instead of eliminating nuclear weapons, the Bush administration is seeking funds to develop two new nuclear weapons, a low yield "mini-nuke" and a robust nuclear earth penetrator or "bunker buster." Second, because the development of these new weapons will require testing, the administration has refused to submit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for ratification and has instead sought funds to ready the Nevada test site for future testing. In its proposed 2005 budget, the administration has requested $6.8 billion for conducting research and expanding U.S. nuclear capabilities.
.
This is twice the amount the U.S. spent in this area a decade ago.
.
Third, since these new nuclear weapons are in reality first-use weapons, the administration has revised its nuclear strategy. In its December 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, the administration made clear that it would be prepared to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states, including launching preemptive attacks with nuclear weapons against nations that were close to acquiring nuclear arsenals.
.
This new strategy may well have led North Korea and Iran to accelerate their own nuclear programs.
.
Fourth, while arguing that other nations cannot withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Bush administration itself withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and has actually deployed a national missile defense system in Alaska. Although this system is designed to combat an intercontinental missile threat from North Korea, it has already provoked Russia to increase its nuclear capabilities and may well provoke China to do the same.
.
In addition to undermining the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Bush administration has weakened America's own nonproliferation efforts. For example, it has decreased funding for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction initiative that has deactivated more than 6,000 nuclear warheads in the former Soviet Union.
.
Moreover, while the administration signed a Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia that commits both sides to reduce the number of operationally deployed nuclear weapons to between 1,700 and 2, 000 by Dec. 30, 2012, it plans to keep another 3,000 nuclear weapons in storage, refuses to include new verification mechanisms in the treaty, and has not agreed to compliance beyond 2012.
.
Preventing Iraq from acquiring nuclear weapons or passing them on to a terrorist group like Al Qaeda was a primary justification for a war that has caused thousands of American casualties and cost the American taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars.
.
Yet in its approach to nonproliferation, the administration is doing things that increase the dangers of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.

ATHENS After years of suffering the skeptics and all their "never on Sunday" jokes about Greek efficiency, the organizers of the Summer Olympics in Athens say that everything needed for the Games is ready - or just about.
.
It happened just under the wire, but marble-clad subway stations are open, the trains are running, miles of new highways and overpasses are finished, security cameras are in place, stadium seats are finally installed and thousands of police officers and soldiers are on patrol. Bomb-sniffing dogs have completed their sweeps of most of the 37 sports venues, some of them architectural wonders that were messy construction sites only a few weeks ago.
.
"I think people should give us a break," said Mayor Dora Bakoyannis, whose employees are still working overtime planting trees, cutting curbs for the handicapped and washing down statues for Friday's opening ceremony.
.
While some Greek officials have expressed a sense of defiant pride at their frenzied rush to the finish, the last-minute preparations for the Games have created a few security headaches for an event that could provide a tempting target for terrorists.
.
Athens is a city of 4.5 million people and thousands of tourists, and large crowds are expected to gather not only for the Olympics but also for dozens of smaller outdoor cultural events planned by the city. While Giorgos Voulgarakis, the minister of public order, has said Greece has prepared itself as well as humanly possible against potential threats, the last-minute completion of many Olympic sites has prompted some worry.
.
The government has also quarreled with the American company Science Applications International, which was hired to provide an elaborate security system to spot suspicious activity and give early warnings if chemical, biological or nuclear weapons are detonated. The two sides are now involved in a dispute over what the contract entailed. The system relies on a grid of surveillance and tracking devices, including a blimp full of cameras and recording devices that now floats above the city, to collect, integrate and analyze data for use by the police and Greek military. Problems with the system's communications software delayed its full implementation, which in turn kept the 4,000 people in Greece's command and control center from having hands-on practice with it until last week. The late finish of many of the Olympic sites also delayed the installation and testing of security equipment.
.
The system became fully operational after the software issues were resolved on Aug. 1, according to a spokesman for the Public Order Ministry. Last Friday, the various Greek ministries that are supposed to respond to any incidents were still ironing out "last-minute issues," the spokesman said.
.
Athens has had seven years to pull the Games together, but the Greek government, the city and the original organizing committee dawdled until the International Olympics Committee gave them a stern warning in 2000.
.
A burst of energy brought progress on many of the infrastructure improvements that Athens had promised for the Games. But the general impression conveyed by the construction stops and starts was of barely controlled chaos.
.
For a while it seemed the Greeks were trying to jinx their own efforts.
.
Animal welfare groups objected to the roundup of stray dogs. Environmentalists said the new projects would waste water and energy. Labor unions were peeved at not getting the same $3,000 bonuses offered to police officers and soldiers. Prostitutes claimed the police were picking on them, and people who did not like security cameras claimed they were being spied on.
.
Even Bakoyannis, the mayor, who had grown accustomed to the constant carping of her constituents, was taken aback when "feminists" attacked her for saying that Athens badly needed a facelift.
.
In the end, the government threw fiscal caution to the winds, authorizing massive amounts of overtime and bonuses for workers to finish the projects and promise to stay on their jobs until the Games end on Aug. 28. When television broadcasters asked for different lighting, security officials wanted more soldiers and other athletic groups suggested add-ons and changes, the Olympics organizers agreed and plowed ahead.
.
"We didn't say 'no' to anybody," said Fanni Palli-Petralia, the deputy culture minister in charge of the government's Olympics efforts. "Whatever was asked, we did." She said she could not say how much the whole effort would end up costing. "But it will be huge," she said.
.
Other government officials have said that cost overruns, extra overtime pay and unexpected security costs had already pushed the Olympics total past $7 billion. Privately, some officials said they feared the final cost of putting on the Olympics might surpass $10 billion.
.
In the past three weeks alone, authorities have opened up a subway line, four subway stations, suburban rail stations, a pedestrian bridge, parking garages, superhighways and tunnels. As a result, Athens is no longer a dowdy, down-at-the-heels capital. Trees, plants and grass have been planted - or left strategically in pots on city squares - and flattering lighting has been set up at sites like the Acropolis.
.
"It's not so green as we wanted," Palli-Petralia acknowledged. "We wanted to have big trees, and they are not so big now. But they will grow."
.
In their relief at having gotten this far, many Olympic officials said that Greece had proved itself to those outside skeptics who doubted it could make up for all the lost time.
.
"People believed the Greeks are never disciplined," said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the president of the national Olympics organizing committee. With preparations nearly finished, she said, "I feel fortunate and satisfied and proud."
.
Her exuberance is a sign of how much Greece has invested, if belatedly, in the Olympics, said Theodore Couloumbis, director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy.
.
"These Olympics will be decisive in terms of finalizing our transition to self-esteem," he said. "No more insecurities, which in turn create this kind of bravado that says, we are the best, we are the chosen, we are surrounded by enemies and everything that is wrong is the result of a conspiracy in Washington or New York. Finally, we can create the impression we are a normal European country."
.



JERUSALEM The Israeli military opened the border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt on Friday, permitting an estimated 2,000 stranded Palestinians to return home for the first time since July 18.
.
Israel kept the crossing closed during that time, saying it was concerned about a possible attack. Palestinians stranded at the terminal on the Egyptian side of the border included pregnant women and some who had gone for medical treatment in Egypt.
.
The first group of stranded travelers arrived in Gaza early Friday, according to news reports. Nihad Abu Jazar, 22, a third-year student at Cairo University, had waited for 21 days to cross the terminal. Jumping off the bus, Abu Jazar fell into the arms of her relatives, tears streaming down her face.
.
She said she was forced to violate Islamic custom by being constantly in the presence of men. She said she almost broke down several times and returned to Cairo. "But every time I convinced myself that they might open any time, and to be honest I don't have enough money," she told The Associated Press.
.
The travelers spent the first week sleeping on the ground, Abu Jazar said. Later, the Egyptians and charity organizations brought basic supplies, including mattresses. But there were not enough toilet facilities, and people were forced to stand for hours waiting to use the facilities.
.
Palestinians, foreign governments and human rights groups had raised concerns about the worsening conditions on the border, where three pregnant women had suffered miscarriages in recent days.
.
The Israeli army said Thursday that it had been "in permanent contact with international humanitarian organizations" during the closure. Israel had offered to open an alternate crossing, but the proposal was rejected by Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, both saying it would violate existing border agreements with Israel.
.
During the closure, hundreds of Palestinians slept outdoors on the ground near the Rafah terminal, while others waited at hostels or returned to Cairo. Earlier this week, Egypt warned of a humanitarian crisis.
.
Israel Army Radio said the crossing would be open for extra hours Friday and Saturday to allow travelers to return home as quickly as possible.
.
The Haaretz newspaper's Web site reported that U.S. pressure forced Israel to reopen the crossing. Under terms of interim peace accords, Israel controls the crossings between the Palestinian territories and neighboring countries.
.
Meanwhile, Israel is pursuing a plan to link Jerusalem and the largest settlement in the West Bank, Maale Adumim, the settlement's mayor was quoted as saying on Thursday.
.
Benny Kashriel, the mayor of Maale Adumim, told the Maariv newspaper that government ministries were working to expand the settlement westward and effectively connect it to Jerusalem, about four miles away. Such a move would go against the Middle East peace plan, which calls for a freeze on Israeli settlement activity. Maale Adumim is sensitive because it is so large and so close to Jerusalem. The Palestinians want a future capital in east Jerusalem, but Arab neighborhoods in that part of the city are increasingly surrounded by Jewish settlements.
.
This week, Israel's Defense Ministry confirmed a separate plan to build 600 more homes in Maale Adumim. The U.S. State Department responded by urging Israel to stick by its pledge to halt settlement expansion. On Thursday evening, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told the U.S. envoy Elliott Abrams that Israel was not planning to connect Maale Adumim to Jerusalem, the Israeli media reported.
.
In another development, Israel will permit some Palestinian police in the West Bank to resume carrying weapons in public for the first time in more than two years, The Associated Press reported, citing Israeli officials.

Failure to handle drug issue alleged
 
Less than three weeks before the Olympics in Athens, the chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee has harshly criticized the leadership of the U.S. track federation for failing to admit the seriousness of the drug problem in the sport. He also warned that after the games, the Olympic committee would take a much harder look at the sport.
.
As the scandal from the U.S. investigation of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative continues to shake track and field, Jim Scherr, the chief executive of the USOC, said he was disturbed that the drug-related issues had dominated pre-Games attention and taken it away from athletes who rarely find the spotlight.
.
Six athletes entered the Olympic track and field trials in Sacramento, California, having been charged with doping violations by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. And during the Olympic trials, it was revealed that three athletes had tested positive for banned substances before competition began.
.
Two runners who qualified for the U.S. Olympic team, Torri Edwards and Calvin Harrison, are in the midst of their drug-hearing procedures, and Marion Jones is under investigation but has not been charged.
.
Scherr said he recognized that the anti-doping agency, which is an independent agency, controlled the drug testing.
.
But based on the proliferation of positive tests, he said in a telephone interview Monday, the leaders of track "either haven't done enough or have been negligent and/or have somehow slipped on that responsibility."
.
Scherr said he believed that USA Track Field was not sending the right message to athletes, coaches and agents about the use of performance-enhancing drugs.
.
"There has to be an attitude and leadership among the influencers and powerful people in the sport that it's simply not acceptable," Scherr said. "Those among that group of track and field did not take the issue as seriously as they should have or as soon as they should have."
.
Craig Masback, the chief executive of USA Track Field, defended his federation's handling of the issue.
.
"Clearly our view is that, one, we take responsibility, and two, if a single athlete tests positive, it's a serious problem," Masback said.
.
In June, before the Olympic trials, Masback identified the problem as a "small subculture" of cheaters. On Monday, he cited the small number of positive tests. According to the doping agency, 11 of the 22 athletes penalized this year are in track and field.
.
"This is not a track problem alone, it's a sports problem in America," Masback said, adding that the federation had outlined 10 steps to fulfill its zero-tolerance policy. Those initiatives include drug education for members, the creation of a whistle-blower program and the institution of more punitive measures. But only the anti-doping agency can penalize an athlete.
.
Based on current results, Scherr said, zero tolerance has not been very effective. Scherr sent a strong message to USA Track Field about putting athletes on relay teams who either have trials pending or could represent a risk of retroactive suspension after the games for a drug charge.
.
"USA Track Field needs to be careful in communicating with coaches, when somebody is under some sort of process, that perhaps that person should be kept off to the relay until the process is settled," Scherr said.
.
"We wouldn't recommend that directly to them; it is something we would hope they would take into account from their experience."
.
The way USA Track Field handled the case of the sprinter Jerome Young incensed the Olympic committee, the international track community and world anti-doping leaders and led to the creation of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
.
Young was found guilty of a doping offense in 2000, then was exonerated on appeal by a USA Track Field arbitration panel. He ran in qualifying rounds of the gold-medal-winning 1,600-meter relay team at the Olympics that year in Sydney. Citing privacy rules, USA Track Field did not divulge his name to the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body.
.
Last month, the world body overturned the Young decision, barred him retroactively for two years and recommended that his relay teammates be stripped of its medals.
.
In 2003, the USOC threatened to decertify USA Track Field for its lack of cooperation in the Young case. The year before, the committee made the same threat, demanding that the federation improve its financial reporting and drug testing facilities.
.
As for decertification, Scherr said, "I can't say that's where it's heading, but the situation will be looked at by our board, and there will be serious discussion with the leadership."
.
The New York Times






E-mail, text messaging and Internet access from mobile phones were little more than futuristic ideas and overhyped promises at the time of the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
.
But the recent European soccer tournament gave a glimpse of how much the wireless world has changed since then and what next month's Olympics in Athens might bring.
.
About 680,000 foreign visitors roamed onto the Vodafone mobile network in Portugal over the four weeks of the Euro 2004 competition there in June and July, and more than two million voice calls and 5.9 million text messages originated on cellphones in and around the Lisbon stadium.
.
On July 4, the day of the final match between Portugal and Greece, voice calls increased 600 percent and text messaging by 1,500 percent over the previous day, Bobby Leach, a Vodafone spokesman, said.
.
The Athens Olympics will attract far more spectators - about five million over 17 days, compared with 1.2 million over 23 days in Lisbon - causing some to question the ability of cellular networks in Greece to handle the unprecedented volume.
.
Never before will so many people have brought so many mobile phones to such a limited space. People are more dependent than ever on wireless devices to stay in touch, arrange meeting places, find hotels or check schedules.
.
There is a psychological dependency as well. Michael Hulme, a professor at the University of Lancaster in England who has conducted studies on the role of mobile phones in people's lives, said spectators had a high incentive to make calls. With the ability to describe an event in real time, "we become celebrities within our own production, and the mobile phone is our production tool," he said.
.
As dependency grows, so do expectations. Business people who attend conferences such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, are familiar with overwhelmed networks that end in dropped calls. But after 12 years of steady improvement in European GSM networks, many people now see cell service the same way they see electricity: They expect it to work, no matter what demands are placed upon it.
.
For the Sydney Games, the telecommunications carrier Telstra said it handled a total of 10 million calls, which amounted to an extra 1.5 million minutes of traffic daily from about four million visitors. As much as 10 percent of calls did not get through, but Telstra considered its performance a success.
.
Because of the added variable of increasingly popular phone e-mail and Internet traffic for this Olympics, however, "in many respects it is unknown territory," said Reg Coutts, an independent consultant who worked at Telstra's mobile unit before the Sydney Olympics.
.
Coutts said that the dominant mobile technology in Athens, called GPRS, did not easily accommodate increases in use, "and there is a real risk that it might not be able to handle traffic demand."
.
During the Olympics:
.
Samsung will supply the Athens Organizing Committee and VIPs - about 14,000 people - with a mobile phone for real-time scoring, event timetables and logistics, said Jay Choi, Samsung's Olympic technology director.
.
Cosmote Mobile Telecommunications, an official Olympic sponsor, plans to showcase its third-generation mobile service, introduced in May, which offers video calls and Internet browsing at 10 times the speed of GPRS.
.
A multilingual "tourist guide" cellphone service from Cosmote, using voice-recognition and location-based technology, will give users details about restaurants, beaches, archaeological sites, museums, theater shows, transportation schedules and emergency phone numbers.
.
Cosmote said it was working in close cooperation with Vodafone Greece and TIM in Greece, as well as mobile operators outside the country, to ensure a smooth flow of mobile traffic and said it anticipated no problems.
.
It has invested more than E50 million, or $62 million, to upgrade its mobile phone infrastructure in Athens, the surrounding Attica region and the five other Olympic cities in time for the Games.
.
Within the Olympic stadium, the Cosmote network capacity will be increased as much as 15-fold, the company said. Five new base station control centers, a mobile telephony center and a GPRS customer service center are also being added.
.
 





Leadership in Paris
 
PARIS No other European country fascinates Americans as much as France does. It is a morbid interest, no doubt, usually inspired by annoyance or fury at France's resistance to American rectitude, expressed in condescending comment on France's assumed backwardness - or, in the preferred epithet of the Bush administration, its "irrelevance."
.
But if France were irrelevant, of course, no one would bother.
.
The French earned anger last year for blocking United Nations Security Council approval of the American and British invasion of Iraq. Iraq will undoubtedly provide next year's argument as well, since uprisings and disintegration in that country are sure to continue. A re-elected George W. Bush or a newly elected John Kerry will redouble the national stake in the losing game; both now seem committed to that.
.
President Jacques Chirac of France is written off by Washington as adamantly against further European implication in America's Middle Eastern adventure. Hence American interest in his replacement, and in the challenge offered Chirac by Nicolas Sarkozy, the economics minister. He is the ambitious son of Hungarian immigrants, a lawyer rather than a product of the established French "grandes ecoles" system, which serves as a feeder to government posts.
.
He recently visited the United States, wangled an interview with Secretary of State Colin Powell, and conducted himself with the press, as he does at home, as the man about to take over France.
.
This excited much interest among Americans, who had never heard of him before. But Sarkozy somewhat damaged his presentation as the cosmopolitan European by insisting on speaking English, which he doesn't do very well.
.
Sarkozy excited conservatives by suggesting that he is a great admirer of American ways of economic management, lauding the American entrepreneurial spirit and suggesting that France has a lot to learn.
.
As France's newly appointed economics minister, however, he has supported state sponsorship of "national champions" in industry, sought an easing of European rules on balanced budgets, and in other respects disappointed the American Enterprise Institute and The Wall Street Journal.
.
Although he currently is vastly popular among the militants of the presidential party, the UMP, which he is expected to try to take over, Sarkozy will not become president, at least not in 2007.
.
His aggressive ways may erode his youthful charm during the three years that remain before the scheduled presidential election. His enemies, Chirac first among them, have time to act. He lacks gravitas, the seriousness and maturity that the French have in the past expected in their presidents. He speaks in the popular idiom and, to some ears, with a trace of foreign accent.
.
Despite much concern in France over the economy and the prospects of a European Union with 25 members, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin may prove a sounder political bet for the long run. Most commentators in France would seem to disagree, but some share my view.
.
In his cautious way, Raffarin has managed to put through significant reforms in the national health system and the retirement regime of government functionaries, as well as decentralizing the administration. His conservative predecessor in the first Chirac presidency, Alain Juppé, tried similar reforms and provoked something like a popular revolt.
.
The daily newspaper Le Monde has campaigned against Raffarin for some time, and the Socialist Party demands his replacement because the government parties lost badly in regional and European elections this spring. The people have repudiated the government, it argues.
.
The left wants very much to return to the parliamentary system of the Third and Fourth Republics, which they believe more authentically democratic. It argues that as the government has been defeated on regional issues and in the election for the European Parliament, Chirac should call new national elections.
.
The left is hoist by its own petard. It, as well as a part of the right, wanted, and in 2002 got, a reduction in the presidential term from seven to five years, a fundamental constitutional change. If France had stayed with the old seven-year presidential term, meant to produce nonconcordant terms for president and Parliament, which is elected for five years, the left would have a better case to make.
.
Under the old Constitution, a government's electoral defeat or severe setback was expected to cause the president either to call for a new Parliament - and resign if it failed to support him - or appoint a nonpartisan prime minister and cabinet.
.
That Gaullist assumption has been defied by both of Charles de Gaulle's successors, François Mitterrand, a Socialist, and the post-Gaullist Chirac. They preferred to run no personal political risks. The result is that the present government will last until its term is up, and American hopes that Paris might return to "relevance" will have to be postponed, once again.

A role for artists
 
NEW YORK A nation's artists and musicians have a particular place in its social and political life. Over the years I've tried to think long and hard about what it means to be American: about the distinctive identity and position we have in the world, and how that position is best carried. I've tried to write songs that speak to our pride and criticize our failures.
.
These questions are at the heart of this year's presidential election: who we are, what we stand for, why we fight. Personally, for the last 25 years I have always stayed one step away from partisan politics. Instead, I have been partisan about a set of ideals: economic justice, civil rights, a humane foreign policy, freedom and a decent life for all of our citizens. This year, however, for many of us the stakes have risen too high to sit this election out.
.
Through my work, I've always tried to ask hard questions. Why is it that the wealthiest nation in the world finds it so hard to keep its promise and faith with its weakest citizens? Why do we continue to find it so difficult to see beyond the veil of race? How do we conduct ourselves during difficult times without killing the things we hold dear? Why does the fulfillment of our promise as a people always seem to be just within grasp yet forever out of reach?
.
I don't think John Kerry and John Edwards have all the answers. I do believe they are sincerely interested in asking the right questions and working their way toward honest solutions. They understand that we need an administration that places a priority on fairness, curiosity, openness, humility, concern for all America's citizens, courage and faith.
.
People have different notions of these values, and they live them out in different ways. I've tried to sing about some of them in my songs. But I have my own ideas about what they mean, too. That is why I plan to join with many fellow artists, including the Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, REM, the Dixie Chicks, Jurassic 5, James Taylor and Jackson Browne, in touring the United States this October. We will be performing under the umbrella of a new group called Vote for Change. Our goal is to change the direction of the government and change the current administration come November.
.
Like many others, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, I felt America's unity. I don't remember anything quite like it. I supported the decision to enter Afghanistan and I hoped that the seriousness of the times would bring forth strength, humility and wisdom in our leaders.
.
Instead, America dived headlong into an unnecessary war in Iraq, offering up the lives of our young men and women under circumstances that are now discredited. We ran record deficits, while cutting and squeezing services like after-school programs. We granted tax cuts to the richest 1 percent (corporate bigwigs, well-to-do guitar players), increasing the division of wealth that threatens to destroy our social contract with one another and render mute the promise of "one nation indivisible."
.
It is through the truthful exercising of the best of human qualities - respect for others, honesty about ourselves, faith in our ideals - that we come to life in God's eyes. It is how our soul, as a nation and as individuals, is revealed. Our American government has strayed too far from American values. It is time to move forward. The country we carry in our hearts is waiting.

The Yukos affair
 
NEW YORK Last week the Russian government took steps to seize and sell the prize asset of Russia's largest oil company, Yukos, toward payment of the company's nearly $6.8 billion in back taxes. This Yukos asset, Yuganskneftegaz, is a production facility that accounts for 70 percent of Yukos' reserves and produces roughly 60 percent of all Yukos oil - a production level about the same as Indonesia's.
.
This and other recent developments - including the arrest last week on multiple murder charges of the company's largest shareholder, a close friend of Yukos's chief executive - make clear that Yukos's existence as a viable company is in jeopardy. Despite Yukos's offer Wednesday to sell its gas subsidiary Rosplan - things are not looking good.
.
This is all more than a little surprising, because President Vladimir Putin told reporters just last month during a visit to Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, that "Russian officials, the government and economic officials of the country are not interested in bankrupting a company like Yukos."
.
Investors in Russia were ready to take those words to the bank. After all, if Vladimir Putin said he didn't want to see a bankrupt Yukos, then the oil giant wouldn't face bankruptcy. Right?
.
But Yukos is now facing bankruptcy.
.
Russia watchers remain interested in the long and winding Yukos saga for two reasons. First, Yukos pumps about 1.7 million barrels a day, or about 2 percent of the world's oil. Its actions produce ripple effects well beyond Russia's borders. Second, the fate of Yukos's chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, currently in prison on tax evasion and fraud charges, may offer insight into Russian tax reform and Putin's intentions toward the so-called oligarchs.
.
Is the Kremlin sending a powerful message to Russia's business elite to stay out of politics? Is Putin hoping to nationalize the energy industry again? Will loyal supporters be rewarded with valuable assets, such as control of major companies at bargain-basement prices?
.
In other words, is the Yukos case just about Yukos? The answer appears to be no. Putin and several of his advisers have stressed, publicly and privately, that several oligarchs have not paid sufficient taxes on the assets they picked up in the fire-sale privatizations of the 1990s. While the government's next moves are not likely to be as spectacular as the high-profile arrests and subsequent asset-stripping at Yukos, the Kremlin will probably continue to revisit the asset valuations of major Russian companies in an effort to reassert state control over such extractive industries as oil, gas and metals.
.
There is another, more interesting, question: Given that the Kremlin is pushing Yukos directly toward bankruptcy, why did Putin say publicly last month that the bankruptcy of Yukos was not in the government's interests? Why would he publicly signal one intention and then do the opposite, particularly in a case watched so closely by international investors?
.
Putin's claim that he would not interfere with the judiciary in the bankruptcy case isn't credible. The Kremlin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest and Putin was directly involved in the timing and charges filed. Even key ministers - most recently, Finance Minister German Gref - have publicly acknowledged that the charges against Khodorkovsky were, at least in part, political.
.
So what are we to make of the gap between Putin's statements and his government's actions? There appear to be three possible explanations.
.
First, Putin's statement last month may have allowed Khodorkovsky to believe he had more leverage than he really had to negotiate his way out of his legal and financial troubles. Thus, he decided to hold out for a deal to keep Yukos mostly intact - a deal insufficiently favorable to the Kremlin, and, in the end, Putin decided that bringing him toward a deal acceptable to the Kremlin was not politically expedient.
.
The second possibility is that Putin genuinely didn't want Yukos to face bankruptcy but didn't have the power to prevent it. The Kremlin's security services faction wanted a shot at picking up Yukos' assets in what would amount to a rigged bankruptcy auction, and perhaps a new cadre of shadowy oligarchs were simply able to outmaneuver the president.
.
The third scenario is that Putin never intended to allow Yukos to remain intact but made the conciliatory comment in a cynical attempt to talk up the Yukos share price. In the process, Putin would reward the loyalty of friends and supporters, who would stand to earn significant profits through timely investments in Russian stocks.
.
The markets, of course, prefer the first scenario. Investors want to believe that Putin means what he says and that his statements dovetail with his actions. Blaming Khodorkovsky for the ruin of Yukos investors means that Putin, at least, can be trusted. This theory does not, however, explain why the Kremlin intended that a majority of Yukos production be sold off at 10 percent, or less, of its value. Even with no deal with Khodorkovsky in place, the Kremlin could still have sold Yukos assets at auction, or even to the state, at a reasonable market price - with relatively little adverse market perception.
.
The second scenario - that Putin's power is checked by others in the Kremlin - is the most troubling for the markets, suggesting as it does that unknown forces are making market-relevant decisions and will have significant influence on Russia's future business climate.
.
But this also seems unlikely, given Putin's considerable consolidation of power over the past three years - through his increased influence in Parliament, his direct authority over state power through the creation of super-governors and super-ministries, and his control of Russia's broadcast media.
.
The third scenario, unfortunately, rings most true. It tars Putin and his government with corruption, something market watchers have been loathe to contemplate. But it is worth remembering that Russia's former prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov - known as "Misha 2 Percent" for the amount he allegedly skimmed from business deals in which he involved himself - remained in power and close to the Kremlin for almost all of Putin's first term, far longer than observers expected.
.
Unfortunately, of all the plausible explanations, the most likely scenario is that the Russian president sought to influence the market. That suspicion will likely give international investors pause as they consider whether or not to invest in Russian energy projects.
.
If friends of the Kremlin want their 2 percent of a company that pumps 2 percent of the world's oil, they will probably get it. The Yukos affair certainly seems headed in that direction. But the pall that such a suspicion casts over investor confidence in the Kremlin's willingness to create a level business playing field could wind up, in the long run, costing Russia's economy far more.

US Airways passengers who left Logan Airport in Boston 20 minutes late were delayed further when their Washington-bound plane made an unscheduled stop in Albany, New York, and picked up President George W. Bush's twin daughters.Jenna and Barbara Bush were among 38 passengers stranded Saturday after an Albany-to-Washington flight was canceled because of maintenance problems. The airline decided to send the plane from Boston to pick up the daughters and 22 others on the flight. A US Airways spokesman said the airline diverted the flight under a policy designed to accommodate passengers on canceled flights when possible. He said the fact that the Bush twins were among them had nothing to do with the decision.

CANBERRA Over the last couple of years Norma Khouri and I have found ourselves performing at Australian literary festivals. During book-signing sessions, I would look wistfully at the long queues waiting for an endorsement from the hand that wrote "Forbidden Love."
.
Described as a true story, the book (published in the United States, to much less notice, under the title "Honor Lost") tells of Dalia, Khouri's closest friend in Jordan, who was stabbed to death by her bigoted Muslim father after she fell in love with a Christian soldier. The haunting cover photograph of an Arab beauty peeping mysteriously from behind a chador seemed to encapsulate the author herself - a brave, soulful Arab woman campaigning with all her heart against Muslim honor killings.
.
Having sold more than 200,000 copies here, "Forbidden Love" has by Australian standards been a runaway bestseller, and Khouri has become a star. It's not hard to see why. She's a compelling performer, and her book had all the ingredients of a romance novel in chador, but with the extra cachet of truth.
.
Now "Forbidden Love" has been withdrawn from sale. Norma Khouri's elaborate dual fabrication started to unravel when a Jordanian women's rights advocate, Amal al-Sabbagh, became suspicious of the book's topographical inconsistencies, cultural gaffes and whiffs of ideology. She and her colleagues uncovered scores of errors, including, they said, the nonexistence of Dalia and her punitive father. Back in Australia, a journalist fluent in Arabic was also puzzled by Khouri's rudimentary grasp of her native tongue.
.
Malcolm Knox, a Sydney journalist, began an inquiry that led him to the neat brick duplexes of Chicago's Southwest Side. There he found Khouri's mother, Asma Bagain, and learned that Khouri herself had moved from Jordan to the United States at age 3. Further digging uncovered a sad trail of inventions, duplicities, domestic squabbles and evaporated dreams. Married to a John Toliopoulos, who, reports say, is being sought by the FBI after being accused in a real-estate fraud, Khouri decamped in 1999 without leaving a forwarding address.
.
In Australia, these revelations have provoked soul-searching, particularly among the literati. Why did we, known for wry cynicism, prove so susceptible to her fictions? Did she realize that this country has long been a Mecca for literary frauds?
.
One of our most cherished modern poets, Ern Malley, was actually a brilliant spoof devised by two conservatives who wanted to ridicule the fatuities of 1940s literary trends. In recent times, Australian literary hoaxes have been motivated by the desire to manufacture stories that conform to marketable fashions. In 1995, Helen Darville won a swag of literary awards for a quasi-historical novel about the Holocaust in the Ukraine that gained extra force from her assumed identity as Helen Demidenko. A real-life Serbian immigrant, Streten Bozic, found it easier, however, to get published as an Aboriginal named B. Wongar. A Sydney taxi driver, Leon Carmen, produced a heartfelt memoir called "My Own Sweet Time" written in the guise of an Aboriginal woman called Wanda Koolmatrie.
.
It is understandable why Norma Khouri might imagine Australia to be a congenial place to remake herself. Our melting pot of migrants has offered plentiful opportunities for those who want to shuck off old identities.
.
But Australia has a tradition of trenchant investigative journalism with a taste for unearthing dodgy pasts. So how do we explain the tardiness of Norma Khouri's exposure?
.
The answer is that everyone was disarmed by her palpable sincerity. Observers couldn't help being moved by her visceral anguish and her ardor to rectify the wrongs of Jordanian women. Sometimes, it seems, a new identity can be taken up with the force of a conversion. For people trapped in shabby pasts, a new persona can offer liberating as much as predatory opportunity.
.
Khouri's imposture doesn't mean that she lacks literary ability. Had "Forbidden Love" been a novel, there would have been little fuss, for it is a good read. Successful charlatanism is, after all, a type of artistry that demands great psychological insight and empathy - qualities that don't go amiss in a writer. The test will come when Norma Khouri decides to write her own real-life memoir, not as a Jordanian exotic but as a girl from the Southwest Side of Chicago.

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (Reuters) - The World Court said Friday it would rule on the legality of Israel's West Bank barrier next month in a case underlining a stalemate in peace efforts after more than three years of violence.

The International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, will render its judgment on the legality of the West Bank network of fences and walls in a public hearing on July 9, one of the most high-profile rulings in its 58-year-history.

Israel says the barrier has been built to keep Palestinian suicide bombers out of its cities. Palestinians call the structure -- which cuts deep into the West Bank in places -- a land grab that would thwart their dream of a viable state. The court held hearings on its legality in February.

The network snakes into the West Bank in some sections and in others runs close to the "Green Line" boundary between Israel and the West Bank before the 1967 Middle East war. Plans call for the barrier to stretch about 420 miles, with 115 miles built so far.

The United Nations' top court said it would hand down an "advisory opinion." Such a ruling is nonbinding, but Israel fears the General Assembly, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is strong, could use it to lobby for sanctions against the Jewish state.

"After all the legal affidavits that have been presented to the international court, and since the wall is being built on occupied land, we expect that the court will condemn it," Palestinian Communications and Information Minister Azzam al-Ahmed told Reuters.

"We also expect that the court will demand that Israel demolish what has been built," he said.

A dozen countries including Jordan, Cuba, South Africa and Saudi Arabia, gave oral testimony on behalf of Palestinians in February. The Israeli government boycotted the hearings, saying the case was political and beyond the court's jurisdiction.

"The reason why Israel built the fence -- the suicide bombers -- unfortunately ... still exists," Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman David Saranga said.

"The fact that it took the court so long to decide, shows that as opposed to what the Palestinians and other countries said, that (the issue) is so urgent, the court apparently doesn't think it is so urgent," he said.

Although they have criticized the barrier's route, the United States and European Union declined to appear at the hearings in February, saying they fear a court ruling could complicate peace efforts.

The case stems from a Palestinian request -- backed by the United Nations General Assembly -- to decide whether Israel is legally obliged to tear down its barrier. (Additional reporting by Allyn Fisher-Ilan in Jerusalem and Mohammed Assadi in Ramallah)

ENNIS, Ireland (Reuters) - Thousands of troops, police and protesters took up positions across a swathe of western Ireland on Friday ahead of the arrival of President Bush for a summit with the European Union.

Bush was due to arrive at Shannon airport at around 1500 EDT, amid local outrage at the measures taken to secure his safety, while much of the population is deeply unhappy over hosting him while U.S. troops are occupying Iraq.

"Fury and fear as town is turned into a fortress," read the headline in the Irish Examiner, quoting the mayor of Shannon as saying the town's residents were being made into a potential target for a terrorist attack.

"President Bush is coming...at the price of our civil liberties and free movement of people in their own place," complained local newspaper The Clare Champion.

But an Irish police spokeswoman said that by early afternoon on Friday there were no problems with traffic or protesters, as over 4,000 police and 2,000 troops patrolled with armored vehicles, water cannon and helicopters in brilliant sunshine.

Ireland, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU until the end of the month, is hosting the summit at the 16th century Dromoland Castle, which has been completely sealed off by the unprecedented security operation.

Bush will be accompanied by Secretary of State Colin Powell, Commerce Secretary Don Evans, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, and possibly U.S. Trade Representative Bob Zoellick.

The EU side will be headed by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, European Commission President Romano Prodi, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten, Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy, and Transport and Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio.

TIGHT SECURITY IN TURKEY

The U.S. team is due in Ireland only for around 18 hours before heading on to Istanbul, Turkey, for a NATO summit. Security was also tight there after bombs in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, killed four people on Thursday.

The EU-U.S. summit, which formally starts at 11.00 a.m (1000 GMT) on Saturday, is set to focus on political links between the two sides, rather than the economic links which form the mainstay of relations between the two huge trade partners.   

It is the first such summit since the EU expanded last month to take in 10 new countries, raising its population to 450 million, and the first since EU leaders agreed to adopt a constitutional treaty for the bloc a week ago.

EU diplomats say the bloc wants to use this new-found unity, in sharp contrast to the divisions which split its members in the run-up to last year's Iraq war, to show the U.S. side that it is a major political actor and not just a trade bloc.

To back this up, the two sides will agree joint statements on a range of primarily political issues, such as Iraq, the Middle East, counter-terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, as well as on economic questions.

But there will also be a meeting of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, bringing together chief executives of some of the largest companies from both sides of the Atlantic, and the two sides will sign a cooperation agreement between the European Galileo and U.S. GPS satellite navigation systems.

In 2003, the EU exported goods worth 220 billion euros ($267 billion) to the United States, importing 151 billion euros' ($183 billion) worth. Two-way foreign direct investment between the partners was worth over 1.5 trillion euros in 2002. ($1=.8245 Euro)

HAVANA (Reuters) - An independent Cuban journalist walked out of prison to become the sixth ailing government opponent freed after a crackdown on dissent last year, opposition sources said on Thursday.

Manuel Vazquez Portal, 52, who suffers from respiratory problems, was one of 75 dissidents sentenced to an average of 19 years in prison after daylong trials in April 2003.

"He arrived home around midnight and looked well," said Laura Pollan, wife of still-imprisoned Hector Maseda.

Academic Roberto de Miranda, 62, who had been sentenced to 20 years behind bars, was also released on Wednesday. He suffers from a heart condition.

The first of the six was released in April and all were conditionally freed for health reasons.

Last year's crackdown, considered the harshest in decades, provoked an outcry from numerous governments, Pope John Paul, and other prominent people.

Communist authorities accused the 75 opponents of working with the United States to overthrow President Fidel Castro's government, a charge they denied.

The repression led to a dramatic deterioration of Cuba's relations with the European Union, which continues to demand all 75 prisoners be freed.

In a separate case, four other dissidents were unexpectedly released this month after being held for more than two years without trial.

But another 16 government opponents have been jailed since April, according to veteran human rights activist Elizardo Sanchez.

Amnesty International reported this year that there were 88 prisoners of conscience in Cuba.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A North Korean warning that some of its leaders wanted to test a nuclear device overshadowed six-way talks Friday aimed at resolving the North's nuclear crisis, with a U.S. official saying there had been no breakthrough.

"We are far from agreement," the official in Beijing said.

U.S. officials said the comment about a nuclear test, made in a two-hour meeting between Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly and North Korean negotiators in Beijing Thursday, resembled those from Pyongyang in the past.

It raised doubts even faint progress could be achieved as the third round of talks among North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China ended their third day. The previous rounds ended with agreement only to meet again.

The U.S. official, speaking to reporters in the Chinese capital, confirmed the North Korean delegation raised the issue of a nuclear test, but not as a threat.

"They did say something to the effect that there were some persons not identified in DPRK (North Korea) that want to test a nuclear weapon and presumably might do so," the official told reporters.

"It was put as a sort of statement intended, I guess, to interest us. It was not phrased as a threat. But we made clear that we would certainly not welcome any such thing and we believe that any such thing would be a very unwise choice."

The U.S. official stressed there had been no breakthroughs.

"Looking at the last two days, I would say there's some good, some bad, some a little ugly but not as much as been the case in the past. The results would have to be described as mixed so far. There are no breakthroughs."

China said a consensus had been reached a freeze would be the first step to the denuclearization of North Korea.

"This round of talks already has reached some results -- a fundamental political consensus exists that a nuclear freeze is the first step toward denuclearization and corresponding measures should be adopted," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue told a news conference.    Continued ...

ASADABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Two U.S. Marines were killed and one wounded when their patrol was ambushed during an operation against Islamic militants in eastern Afghanistan, military officials said on Friday.

The Marines were killed in Kunar province, which borders Pakistan, on Thursday evening, said military spokeswoman Master Sergeant Cindy Beam.

She said the wounded Marine was hurt by gunfire, but she said she did not know how the two were killed.

The attack happened in a mountainous district called Naray close to the border with Pakistan, residents there said. They said they saw the bodies of the two Marines and they appeared to have been shot with AK-47 assault rifles.

Mohammad Zaman Malang, a top military commander in Kunar's capital Asadabad, said the Marines came under fire as they were moving through a valley.

"They were going up on foot and were fired on with heavy and light machineguns," he said.

Malang said the U.S. patrol called in air support and U.S. aircraft dropped bombs, but it was not clear if any attackers were hit. He said the planes were again circling on Friday.

He said the ambush could have been the work of militants loyal to a fundamentalist warlord, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the Taliban or al Qaeda, all of whom are active in the area.

The deaths took to 59 the number of U.S. personnel killed in combat in Afghanistan since U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban for sheltering Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda after the September 11 attacks in 2001.

The Taliban and their allies have declared a holy war against U.S.-led forces and clashes have mounted as September elections, which the militants have vowed to disrupt, approach.

This month, a U.S. soldier was killed and two were wounded when their vehicle was hit by an explosion in the central province of Uruzgan.

Four U.S. special forces soldiers were killed in action in the southern province of Zabul in late May, in one of the worst losses for U.S. forces since the overthrow of the Taliban late in 2001.    Continued ...

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For the first time since the start of the war in Iraq, a majority of Americans now say the U.S.-led invasion was a mistake, according to a USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll released on Thursday.

Amid continuing violence in Iraq and questions about the justification for the war, 54 percent of the 1,005 Americans polled said it was a mistake to send U.S. troops into Iraq, compared with 41 percent who held that view three weeks ago.

The findings mark the first time since Vietnam that a majority of Americans has called a major deployment of U.S. forces a mistake, USA Today reported on its Web site.

In addition, the poll found that for the first time a majority also said the war in Iraq has made the United States less safe from terrorism.

Fifty-five percent said the war has increased U.S. vulnerability, compared to a December poll in which 56 percent said the war made the United States safer.

The war's original justification was to stop Iraq deploying weapons of mass destruction. None have been found.

President Bush has also said the Iraq mission would make America safer by bringing democracy to a key country in the Middle East.

In Iraq on Thursday, insurgents killed about 100 people in a wave of attacks across the country aimed at sabotaging next week's transfer of power to an interim Iraqi government.

Despite Americans' changing attitudes toward the war, the poll found Bush in a statistical dead heat with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Among likely voters, Bush edged out Kerry 48 percent to 47 percent. Three weeks ago, Kerry led 49 percent to 43 percent.

In the new poll, 60 percent of respondents said they believe the Massachusetts Democrat could handle the job of commander-in-chief, but most Americans indicated they trust Bush more in that role, 51 percent to 43 percent.

The survey, conducted Monday through Wednesday, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Thursday accused President Bush of telling "an artful and important lie" soon after the Sept. 11 attacks to set the stage for war on Iraq.

"Beginning very soon after the attacks of 9/11, President Bush made a decision to start mentioning Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein in the same breath in a cynical mantra designed to fuse them together as one in the public's mind," Gore said in a speech at Georgetown University Law Center.

Gore, a Democrat who lost to Bush in a White House race ultimately decided by the Supreme Court despite winning the popular vote in 2000, cited the recent report by the Sept. 11 commission saying no credible evidence existed of a link between the Iraqi leader and bin Laden.

He said Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney continue to argue for a connection between bin Laden's al Qaeda network and the deposed Iraqi regime because it supports their push for war in Iraq and justifies "some of the new power they've picked up from the Congress and the courts" since the 2001 hijack attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.

"As a result, President Bush is now intentionally misleading the American people," Gore said. "Indeed, Bush's consistent and careful artifice is itself evidence that he knew full well that he was telling an artful and important lie -- visibly circumnavigating the truth over and over again as if he had practiced how to avoid encountering the truth."

In an hour-long address punctuated by polite laughter and applause, Gore also accused the Bush administration of working closely "with a network of 'rapid response' digital Brown Shirts who work to pressure reporters and their editors for 'undermining support for our troops."'

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will consider using unique biological data about individuals such as fingerprints and facial features to tighten immigration controls as part of its counter-terrorism policy, government officials said Wednesday.

The move would be in line with measures in many other countries, including the United States, which has begun fingerprinting and photographing most visitors from abroad in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Japan has decided to introduce passports with chips containing so-called biometrics information next year, and would look into whether to make use of such data in screening foreign visitors, the officials said.

Calls for tighter immigration controls have gained momentum since revelations last month that al Qaeda might have attempted to build a network in Japan.

Japanese police arrested several foreigners in May in an investigation into the activities of a French national with links to al Qaeda who entered Japan on a false passport in 2002 and stayed for over a year.

But Tokyo has not made any decisions yet, given concerns that stricter immigration controls might turn off tourists thinking about visiting Japan and due to criticism by some human rights groups that the use of biometrics was a violation of individual rights.

"Biometrics may lead to a strengthening of surveillance of society," said Makoto Teranaka, secretary-general of Amnesty International's Japan branch.

"There must be utmost caution in how such information is gathered and how it is used," he said.

A working team of officials, including those from foreign and justice ministries, plan to start discussions on the issue later this month, officials said.

"We are aware of the debate over private information and the potential impact on our tourism policy," said an official at the Cabinet Office.

Japan has set up a goal to double the number of tourists to Japan by 2010 -- about 5.73 million foreigners entered Japan in 2003 -- to turn around its huge deficit in tourism.

In 2001, the latest year for which official figures are available, Japan had a $23 billion deficit on tourism, with Japanese travelers spending $26 billion abroad, while visitors to Japan spent $3 billion.

ROME (Reuters) - Mariolina Moioli dreams of bringing civilization to Italy's chaotic streets.

That means the end of an era for carefree 14-year-olds who for generations have been allowed to drive scooters without so much as a permit or a driving lesson.

The sight of adolescents buzzing around on their scooters is as quintessentially Italian as pizza and pasta -- as are the daily reports of teen-agers killed after speeding along the Tiber or running a red light in Rome's hectic traffic.

"We're not going to save the world, but it's something," said Moioli, explaining a plan to teach "good behavior" on the roads as part of the preparation for the introduction of a "mini-license" for under-18s wanting to drive scooters. Hundreds of thousands of teen-agers now face the prospect of having to park their beloved Vespas starting July 1 or pay a fine of more than $600 if they are caught without the mini-license.

Currently anybody is allowed to drive a scooter with an engine of 50 cc from the age of 14 without a license.

"It's about behavior and values, about respect for life, how to behave with others, basically how to drive in a civilized way," said Moioli, director general of the Education Ministry.

But 17-year-old Giovanni De Angelis and many fellow teen-agers are crying foul.

"It ridiculous. For more powerful motorbikes maybe it makes sense but not for the smaller ones. And maybe for 14-year-olds -- if they're so small they can't even reach the handle bars."

De Angelis will not be taking the exam himself, he added with a shrug, because his scooter has been stolen.

"It's been chaos, at least they should give a bit more time," he said.

Motor organizations also complain that there has been insufficient time to complete the courses and the tests.    Continued ...

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. plans to scale back spending on films, although it aims to remain a Hollywood staple, Chief Executive Michael Eisner and other executives said on Thursday.

"We are reducing our investment in our film businesses," Eisner said in a small meeting with investors and a Wall Street analyst that the company Webcast.

Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs told the investors that a slate of 13 to 16 films per year for the Disney, Hollywood Pictures and Touchstone labels, produced good results since executives were forced to be selective in the movies they make and market.

"We found there is no direct correlation between spending more and making more in terms of our returns," Chief Operating Officer Bob Iger said.

"We would like to spend less, be more focused, spend more on Disney-branded properties and what I call franchise model pictures" like "Pirates of the Caribbean," he said.

"If we are going to invest in entertainment, I think there are better ways to spend our money than live-action (films), but we are going to continue to invest substantially in it," he said.

Disney's Miramax division also produces films, and Iger said the focus on fewer live-action films could affect negotiations with division chiefs Bob and Harvey Weinstein. Disney has the option to extend their current contract from 2005 to 2009.

"The desire of the company long term is to invest less in live-action movies, and in order to do that, there's got to be some give here and there, and that is sort of where the rubber might meet the road in terms of any future relationship" with the Weinsteins, he said in the meeting with Deutsche Bank's Doug Mitchelson and investors, monitored via Webcast.

FEW PLACES FOR NEW PARKS

Iger also said Disney did not see many more places to build major traditional theme parks around the world beside the one under construction in Hong Kong and a park in Shanghai that Disney is actively considering.

"But we are looking at other concepts," he said, referring to the success of the Disney cruise line pointing to "small parks, weekend concepts" as other possible projects.

Eisner said that he was still looking for the next "chapter" of growth for the company. "I think it is around technology," he said, adding that he was "pretty sure" Disney would stick with creating movies, television and other content rather than exhibition or distribution. He also said the company was focused on international expansion.    Continued ...

LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Just as his "Fahrenheit 9/11" opens nationwide, several filmmakers are readying documentaries aimed at debunking Michael Moore, and a new film festival is being planned that will feature such works as well as other documentaries well to the right of Moore's films.

Scheduled Sept. 9-11 in Dallas, the American Film Renaissance, as the festival will be known, has just been announced by co-founder Jim Hubbard, who said it is bankrolled primarily by some "big-time conservative donors."

Hubbard currently is negotiating to show two films critical of Moore.

The first is "Michael Moore Hates America," made by newcomer Michael Wilson and funded partially by Brian Cartmell, who made a small fortune when he sold his Internet domain registration company, eNic, to Verisign. The feature film, made for $200,000 and featuring appearances from Penn Jillette and John Stossel, among others, is looking for a theatrical and DVD distribution deal.

The second is the bigger-budget effort "Michael & Me" that was made by talk-radio star and soon-to-be TV host Larry Elder. The 90-minute documentary takes on Moore's 2002 anti-gun documentary, "Bowling for Columbine," Elder said.

"My film is a defense of those who own guns and of the Second Amendment," said Elder, whose "The Larry Elder Show" from Warner Bros. Prods. starts Sept. 13 on CBS affiliates in most major markets.

Elder said that he borrows liberally from Moore, including a "Bowling"-like animated segment that has Elder interviewing an obviously tense Moore. "He's sweating and sweating to the point he's reed thin, then he pulls out a gun and shoots me."

Moore didn't agree to an interview for either Elder's movie or Wilson's. "I did ambush him at a book signing in Santa Monica, and that's in the film," Elder said. "I asked him how many times Americans used guns for defensive purposes. He had nothing. No blooming clue."

For Moore's part, he said he's familiar with the title "Michael Moore Hates America" but doubts the movie even exists, beyond the trailer that can be seen on the Internet.

"You're being duped by the kooky right," he said. "I've been waiting to see this movie. It sounds like great science fiction."

Moore said he hadn't heard of Elder's film "Michael & Me."   


As for the festival, Hubbard said that about 10 films are confirmed, and he'll cap it at about two dozen. Film reviewer Michael Medved is a confirmed guest as is Lionel Chetwynd, whose Showtime movie "DC 9/11," starring Timothy Bottoms as President Bush, will be shown.

"I'm itching to show that anywhere I can," Chetwynd said. "Like with all cable films, you want to keep it out there as long as you can to get it in front of as wide an audience as possible."

Hubbard and wife, Ellen, both attorneys, co-founded the festival in the spirit of competition. Boycott efforts, like the one from the group MoveAmericaForward.org that is asking exhibitors not to show Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11," "are for the weak," Hubbard said.

"We want everyone to see Michael Moore's film," he said. "We also want everyone to see 'Michael Moore Hates America.' Conservatives complain about institutional bias in Hollywood. They need to stop whining and get out there and produce."

"Documentaries," added filmmaker Wilson, "are not 'Lions of the Serengeti' anymore. In this politically charged climate, they're skewed to an agenda, be it Michael Moore's or mine."

Not all films screened at the American Film Renaissance will invoke Moore. Patrick Wright's documentary, "Is It True What They Say About Ann?" focuses on Ann Coulter, the Fox News pundit.

And the war on terror also is expected to be a dominant theme at the American Film Renaissance.

"Liberal Hollywood has basically ignored the subject," filmmaker Jason Apuzzo said. His entry to the festival is "Terminal Island" and stars his wife, Govindini Murty, with a cameo from Irvin Kershner, director of "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Never Say Never Again." Kershner, who Apuzzo noted does not share the same politics as Apuzzo and Murty, nevertheless mentored the couple in the making of their film.

"Conservative messages don't have a chance in contemporary Hollywood," Apuzzo said. "But there's another side in Hollywood. We are small in numbers but passionate."

"Terminal Island" is a black-and-white feature film about a woman being stalked by a Muslim terrorist who is himself being stalked by a bounty hunter.

"When you shop a script like this around," said Murty, "studio execs say, 'Is this about Muslim terrorists? We don't want to touch it."'

So why have a couple of lawyers from Texas created a film festival? "I've always been interested in the cultural and political messages in film," Jim Hubbard said. "To be frank, whenever there is such a message, it's liberal. For 40 years the left has had a near monopoly, and we're going to counter that."

 MEXICO: Sanyo official freed in Mexico after ransom paid. 
 Sanyo official freed in Mexico after ransom paid.

 TIJUANA, Mexico 1996-08-19
 
 A "tired but apparently unharmed" Japanese electronics executive was freed by kidnappers on Monday after they received $2 million in unmarked $100 bills, government officials said. 
 After nine days in captivity, Mamoru Konno, president of a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sanyo Electric Co., was found in the basement of an unoccupied building in this northern Mexican city just before 4 a.m. local time. 
 Jose Luis Anaya Bautista, State Attorney General of Baja California, told a news conference the end of the abduction was a two-day ordeal in which the ransom was handed over with no apparent guarantee Konno would be released. 
 He said on Saturday night an officer of Mexico's State Judicial Police drove a Sanyo company vehicle to the La Jolla section of Tijuana where he met two of the alleged kidnappers and handed over an envelope containing $2 million in unmarked $100 bills. 
 At 10 p.m. on Monday night authorities received a call from the kidnappers directing them to an area in the La Mesa district of Tijuana where they found Konno "tired but apparently unharmed" in the basement of a disused building, he said. 
 Anaya said police were looking for six suspects, all believed to be Mexican nationals. 
 "I was pleased to be able to talk to Mr. Konno and to tell him how happy we are to have him back with us safe and sound," Anaya said. "He was very grateful to us for having helped him." 
 Konno was seized on Aug. 10 as he was travelling home to San Diego from a company party and baseball game in Tijuana. 
 He was the first high-ranking foreign executive kidnapped in Mexico in recent years and his abduction fuelled fears that criminals may target some of the thousands of foreign executives who work in factories along the Mexican-U.S. border. 
 Sanyo North America President Moto Haru Iue said: "I express my sincere appreciation for all who helped bring about (Konno's) safe return. Mr. Konno is in good health and relieved it's over." 
 But underscoring some of the doubts that have emerged since the kidnapping about the safety of working in Mexico, he said he did not know if Konno would return to work at the Tijuana plant. "We will have to consider security first," he said. 
 Kidnappings are on the rise in Mexico, fuelled partly by the December 1994 peso crisis and the subsequent deep recession, which threw more than a million people out of work. Experts say amateur and professional criminal gangs, former and current policemen and leftist rebels of the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army are among the main suspects. 
 Konno's release will remove a cloud over the visit to Mexico, set to begin on Tuesday, by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Hashimoto will visit three other countries during a 10-day tour of Latin America. 
 During the ordeal, Mexican police in Baja California had said they were not involved in any efforts to free Konno, saying they had been officially notified by Sanyo of his abduction.

 MMK says all in place for 1996 dividend. 
 VIENNA 1996-08-20
 
 Leading European cartonboard manufacturer Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG (MMK) said on Tuesday it was committed to paying out a dividend for 1996 after scrapping its dividend last year. 
 "The dividend for 1996 has already been secured through payments that have come into the parent company," chief executive Michael Groeller told journalists after presenting the company's first-half earnings. 
 Groeller declined to say how big the dividend would be but said that "our shareholders will be satisfied." 
 Earlier this year investors were miffed when MMK reported an 18 percent jump in 1995 group pre-tax profit to 430 million schillings but decided to scrap its dividend after paying out 14 schillings in 1994. 
 MMK decided to forego a 1995 dividend after profits at the holding company were wiped out by a write-down in Germany, where its FS Karton AG unit suffered significant losses.

 Portuguese bond report. 
 LISBON 1996-08-20 
 
 Bonds were nudging higher but liquidity was very thin on a day when the Treasury rejected all bids at its five-year bond sale. 
 Traders said the market was going to remain on hold until after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later on Tuesday. 
 "There is no desire to do anything in either futures or cash," said one trader. 
 Traders said that the Treasury decision was a clear sign that it was not prepared to accept any increase in yields.   
 Bidded yields had been expected to be higher than the previous sale on July 25 because of uncertainty over the FOMC and the fact that end-users were out of the market. 
 They said demand at the auction only totalled 36 billion for the 20 billion escudos of paper on offer. 
 The escudo was also calm.

 FRANCE: GAN up sharply on CIC report. 
 GAN up sharply on CIC report. 
 PARIS 1996-08-20 
 
 State-controlled insurer GAN jumped up to 6.4 percent on the Paris bourse after a newspaper said savings bank group Caisses d'Epargne was preparing a firm bid for GAN's CIC banking subsidiary. 
 At 1112 GMT, GAN was up 6.7 francs or 5.33 percent at 132.4 francs per share after trading as high as 133.8 francs. 
 Volume however was a thin 7,007 shares. 
 La Tribune Desfosses reported on Tuesday that Caisses d'Epargne, which announced its interest in CIC's upcoming privatisation on August 1, was ready to make a "firm offer" for the regional banking group, of which 67 percent is on sale.   
 Analysts noted Caisses d'Epargne had not publicly contested GAN's book value for CIC of 14.1 billion francs for 100 percent. 
 That would avoid a book loss on the sale for GAN and would mean the state did not have to recapitalise CIC, they said. 
 Analysts said there was also market speculation that Caisses d'Epargne had been persuaded by the state to make an offer for CIC to prevent it going to foreign buyers. 
 Such a move would also mean Caisses d'Epargne using its own funds, which would please commercial banks which want to see the savings bank weakened, they said. Caisses d'Epargne has a monopoly on the popular pass-book Livret A savings account.

 GENEVA 1996-08-20 
 
 The United States reacted angrily on Tuesday to India's formal veto of a nuclear test ban treaty and said it would work to bypass New Delhi's opposition and have the treaty adopted and signed anyway. 
 After a meeting at which India confirmed its veto, U.S. disarmament ambassador Stephen Ledogar accused it of being "insincere" in its arguments against the test ban, telling reporters: "The real reason is that the current government in New Delhi wants to maintain the nuclear weapon option."   
 Earlier, India's Arundhati Ghose told the international Conference on Disarmament that her country could still not accept the treaty text, which it first vetoed in a negotiating committee last week. 
 India, one of three nuclear "threshold states", says that the treaty should include a time-bound commitment by the five declared nuclear powers for total nuclear disarmament. 
 Ledogar said the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was never meant to be a nuclear disarmament pact until India decided last year that it should be so. 
 He said the United States and other supporters of the treaty would act "in the next few days" to either have the draft treaty introduced to the U.N. General Assembly for signature late next month or would convene an international signature conference outside U.N. auspices.

 NETHERLANDS: Pakhoed sees rise in H2 ordinary net. 
 Pakhoed sees rise in H2 ordinary net. 
 ROTTERDAM 1996-08-20 
 
 Dutch tank storage and shipping group Pakhoed NV said on Tuesday it expected net profit from ordinary operations in the second half of 1996 to be "clearly higher" than in the same period of 1995.   
 Pakhoed posted a first-half net profit of 4.6 million guilders, down from 61.4 million in the year-ago period. 
 This year's figure included a 54.3 million guilder extraordinary charge because of the sale of the Furness subsidiary and a restructuring of Pakhoed's Rotterdam tank storage operations. 
 "Apart from the costs in relation to the final transfer of Furness we don't expect further extraordinary charges in the second half-year of 1996," the firm said in a statement. 
 It added its leading positions in logistics and distribution would be a strong basis for further earnings development.   
 Pakhoed said the reorganisation would cause substantial cost reductions at the units concerned. In addition, the sale of Furness and the previously announced takeover of U.S. chemicals distributor Univar Corp would have an important effect. 
 "Royal Pakhoed has taken several important measures aimed at implementing the strategic objectives and which will have a substantial effect on Pakhoed's results for 1996 and will put Pakhoed in a much better position for the future," it said. 
 Pakhoed offered $19.45 per Univar share in June. It said it now owned 97 percent of all Univar shares and said the deal had a total value of 521 million guilders.   
 The company used standby facilities to pay for the Univar takeover but said it intends to carry out a refinancing operation in the autumn of this year. 
 "A study is currently under way to determine the extent and conditions of the refinancing, also depending on the financial divesture of Furness and the determination of the goodwill involved in the acquisition of Univar," Pakhoed said. 
 Earlier this month, it said it had reached a tentative agreement on selling Furness to industrial investment firm Hollandia Industriele Maatschappij NV.

 "We have managed to cut our workforce by around 14 percent over the past year. The bulk is behind us but we will continue with the rationalisation," director Walter Hatak told a news conference. 
 "We aim to shed five percent of (existing) staff annually while replacing one percent," he added.

 Italian energy group Eni said it had sold more than 20 million ordinary shares, or some five percent, in its oilfield services arm Saipem. 
 Eni said in a statement it had reduced its stake in the company to 75 percent but did not say exactly when the shares were sold on the Milan bourse.   
 "The sale of the Saipem stock forms part of Eni's strategy of enlarging the share of (Saipem) on the market and thereby increasing its liquidity," the Eni statement said. 
 The Saipem shares were held by Eni units Agip, Snam and Sofid, the statement said. 
 Saipem shares have surged since the start of the year, trading at 6,630 lire at the time of the Eni announcement against a year low of 3,390 lire recorded on January 16.

 Australian Alan Bond jailed for three years. 
 PERTH, Australia 1996-08-20 
 
 Failed Australian businessman Alan Bond was sentenced to three years in jail on Tuesday for fraud involving the French impressionist painting, La Promenade. 
 The Western Australia District Court sentenced Bond after a jury last Friday found him guilty of four fraud charges, brought by the corporate watchdog the Australian Securities Commission, which carried a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail.   
 Bond, who became a national hero in 1983 for winning the America's Cup yachting trophy, had appealed for a non-custodial sentence. His lawyer argued that a jail term could kill him. 
 But Judge Antoinette Kennedy said she was satisfied Bond's "health problems could be monitored within the prison system". 
 Bond was found guilty of improperly using his position as director of his former corporate flagship, Bond Corporation Holdings, to allow his private company to buy Edouard Manet's La Promenade from Bond Corp for A$2.5 million (US$1.9 million), when its value was at least A$12 million. 
 Bond's Dallhold Investments Pty Ltd sold the painting a year later at auction in New York for A$17 million.

 PARIS 1996-08-20 
 
 Algerian security forces killed five Moslem rebels on Sunday night near Algiers and one person was wounded when a bomb exploded on Monday in a coffee shop in the northeastern town of Tizi-Ouzou, Algerian newspapers said. 
 The newspaper Liberte said the five rebels were killed at Sidi el Kebir, near the capital, and security forces seized weapons. 
 Le Matin said the coffee shop bomb was the second attack on a coffee shop in central Tizi-Ouzou, 90 km (55 miles) from Algiers. 
 A rash of bomb attacks against restaurants and coffee shops in Algiers and other towns in July killed more than 20 people, according to Algerian reports. 
 The government-appointed watchdog body, Human Rights National Observatory (ONDH), was quoted on Monday by el Watan newspaper as saying about 1,400 civilians have been killed in the past two years in bomb attacks, including booby-trapped cars, blamed on Moslem guerrillas. 
 An estimated 50,000 people, mostly Moslem militants and security forces members, have been killed in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.

 Swedish engineering group Atlas Copco said on Tuesday that the stronger crown had a nine percent negative hit on its earnings in the first half of 1996. 
 But, reporting a 12 percent rise in first-half profit after financial items, the company forecast earnings for the full year would still be higher than in 1995 even though demand was expected to remain unchanged.   
 "Demand for the full year 1996 is expected to remain unchanged compared to 1995 levels, and earnings are expected to improve," the company said in a statement. 
 "Market conditions are, however, still uncertain," it added. 
 Atlas reported a 12 percent lift in profit after financial items to 1.57 billion crowns. 
 This profit included a gain of 342 million crowns related to the sale of VOAC Hydraulics and restructuring costs of 225 million crowns within the indsturial technology business area. 
 Sales for the half year rose six percent from a year ago to 12.37 billion crowns and orders received increased three percent to 12.98 billion crowns. 
 "The strengthening of the Swedish crown had, however, a negative effect of nine percent," the company said.

 OMV 96 forecast based on weak polyolefins. 
 VIENNA 1996-08-20 
 
 Austrian oil and chemicals group OMV AG said on Tuesday its forecast for flat full-year earnings was based on a conservative outlook for polyolefins in the fourth quarter. 
 Finance director Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer told a news conference that polyolefin prices in the first half were already well below year-ago levels, squeezing refining and plastics margins. 
 He forecast worse was to come in the fourth quarter. 
 "We expect to match our 1995 result, allowing for a significant deterioration in polyolefins in the fourth quarter," Ruttenstorfer said. 
 "If the downturn does not happen there will be room to improve our full-year result," he added. 
 In 1995, OMV posted a record pre-tax profit of 2.09 billion schillings and earnings before interest and tax of 2.19 billion. 
 Ruttenstorfer estimated polyolefin revenues were down by about one billion schillings in the first half of 1996. 
 "We have undertaken a range of measures to compensate...cutting costs and increasing sales volume by 23 percent," he said. -- Janet McBride, Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254

 GERMANY: German cocoa buyers take back seat in summer lull. 
 German cocoa buyers take back seat in summer lull. 
 HAMBURG 1996-08-20 

 German chocolate manufacturers have shunned cocoa markets during August after taking cover at around the 1,000 stg a tonne levels seen in London futures last month, traders said. 
 "Futures are trending higher and a strong sterling versus the mark is another deterrent," one said. 
 "The past few weeks have been the dullest in years." 
 London September was up six stg at 1,020 at 1030 GMT. 
 Industry was reasonably covered and not worried about price rallies while high summer temperatures discouraged chocolate consumption and some plants remained shut, traders said. 
 Market speculation focused on an Ivory Coast harvest around 800,000-900,000 tonnes, which could bring a deficit of around 150,000-250,000 tonnes in the 1996/97 season. 
 "That's why I think the current consumer attitude might be dangerous given that fourth quarter prices may well be a few hundred sterling higher," another trader said. 
 "But it would be a creeping increase and there is also a danger of a price collapse if the Ivory Coast suddenly comes up with record volumes and qualities," he said. 
 Ivorian beans were quoted at 2.30 marks per kg for Aug/Sept compared with 2.17 marks in late July while the fourth quarter 1996 and first quarter 1997 price of 2.33 was up 0.09-0.11. 
 The cocoa butter ratio was marginally higher at 2.78 for 1996 dates, implying a 6.50 marks outright price for Aug/Sept and 6.45 for fourth quarter, liquid, ex-works. 
 The first quarter 1997 ratio of 2.72 implied a mark price of 6.40.

 Italy antitrust gives go-ahead to Marconi deal. 
 ROME 1996-08-20 
 
 The Italian antitrust watchdog on Tuesday gave the green light to state company Finmeccanica to press ahead with plans to sell its Alenia unit's 50 percent stake in Mac-Alenia Marconi Communications. 
 Finmeccanica said in June it planned to sell the stake for 247 billion lire to its equal partner in the joint venture, Marconi SpA -- a unit of U.K. group GEC, 
 Mac-Alenia Marconi specialises in civilian and military radiocommunications and telematics. 
 The anti-trust said in its weekly statement that the deal would not substantially alter the sector concerned.

 AUSTRALIA: Budget hopes boost Australian stocks at open. 
 Budget hopes boost Australian stocks at open. 
 SYDNEY 1996-08-20 
 
 The Australian share market continued its climb at the opening on Tuesday with buying interest fuelled by expectations of a tight Federal budget from Treasurer Peter Costello later today. 
 The All Ordinaries index rose 13.2 points to 2,274.7, while September share index futures rose 11 points to 2,287, a 12.3 point premium to the underlying index. 
 The buoyancy of Monday afternoon had spilled over, with solid buying interest pushing the bourse to its highest level in nearly four months, brokers said. 
 "What people want from the budget is still pushing it. They expect Costello to be firm," said a Sydney broker. 
 With opening volume levels well up on recent starting levels, buyers had clearly jumped down from the fence they had occupied for the last week. 
 "Buyers from yesterday are still about and they have given it a bit of a go," the broker said. 
 The big banks remained in favour as did cylical stocks such as transport shares Brambles and Mayne Nickless. 
 Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about 14 to four, while about 41 percent of shares traded remained steady.

 FRANCE: FIRS maintains 1996/97 French beet yield estimate. 
 FIRS maintains 1996/97 French beet yield estimate. 
 PARIS 1996-08-20 

 French sugar intervention board FIRS said on Tuesday it held its 1996/97 beet sugar yield estimate of 9.40 tonnes per hectare, from 9.87 in 1995/96 following results of the second beet test by manufacturers. 
 "The test shows a slight improvement but it confirms the 1996/97 campaign will not be exceptional. It would be premature at this stage to change our estimate and we will wait for the results of the third test before eventually adjusting the figures," a FIRS analyst told Reuters. 
 Sugar manufacturers' association SNFS said on Monday the test carried out on August 12 showed sugar weight per hectare fell by 10.2 percent to 6.210 tonnes from 6.916 in last year's second test. 
 This represented a decline of 15 percent from the five-year average of 7.340 tonnes. 
 The number of beets per hectare fell to 101,500 from 109,600 but sugar content rose to 17.48 percent from 16.33 percent. 
 "The second test shows that drought stress is persisting and that a higher sugar content is not making up for a lower number of beets per hectare and a lower root weight," the analyst said. 
 She said the test figures were the lowest when compared to yearly averages since 1991 and five-year averages for 1981-85, 1986-90 and 1991-95. 
 In June FIRS predicted the sugar crop would drop to 3.9 million tonnes from 4.2 million in 1995/96, assuming a decline in area of 9,000 hectares to 420,000 ha. 
 Analyst have said the second test showed no significant crop improvement because the survey was conducted just as badly- needed rainfall hit the growing areas. The third test to be carried out on August 26 should reflect the rain's positive effect, they said. --Dominique Vidalon, Paris newsroom +331 4221 5432

 SWITZERLAND: India confirms nuclear test ban veto. 
 India confirms nuclear test ban veto. 
 Philippe Naughton 
 GENEVA 1996-08-20 
 
 India told the Conference on Disarmament on Tuesday that it could still not accept a draft nuclear text ban treaty, preventing its formal adoption in Geneva after more than two years of negotiations. 
 At a meeting called to examine the final report on negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), Indian ambassador Arundhati Ghose was fiercely critical of a text that she said was unbalanced and violated India's sovereignty. 
 She confirmed that India, which blocked the treaty last week, would veto its transmission to the U.N. General Assembly in New York for signature at the end of next month. 
 "Our opposition to that text continues," Ghose told the conference. "We would not, therefore, agree to it being forwarded to the UNGA in any form by this conference." 
 Her remarks were greeted with anger by India's neighbour and long-time foe Pakistan. "Today, the mask of the smiling Buddha has been torn off, revealing the face of the goddess of war," Pakistani ambassador Munir Akram told the conference. 
 "Pakistan would regret any procedure that would circumvent the Conference on Disarmament, the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum," he added. 
 Yet supporters of the treaty, which include all five declared nuclear powers, hope to bypass India's veto in Geneva and have the treaty signed anyway at the General Assembly. 
 The Conference on Disarmament, or CD, takes all decisions by consensus of its 61 member states. But if the treaty text were presented to the General Assembly in the form of a co-sponsored resolution, it would need only a simple majority of the 185 member states to be adopted -- although opponents of the treaty could also propose amendments to it. 
 It was not clear whether Ghose's remark that the treaty could not be forwarded to New York "in any form" meant the CD would not be able even to transmit the negotiating report to the General Assembly. 
 That report clearly says there is no consensus on the text, but Western diplomats said that since it refers to the text it would be procedurally easier to introduce the treaty in New York if the report was forwarded. 
 If not, a co-sponsored resolution could be more difficult to introduce if the treaty were still to be open for signature from the end of September. 
 India's main problem with the treaty is that it does not commit the five declared nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- to a timetable for full nuclear disarmament, and instead encourages the divide between nuclear "haves" and "have nots". 
 After rejecting the treaty on those grounds, New Delhi was further angered when the draft text demanded that India was among those that signed up to the treaty before it could enter into force. 
 India, along with Pakistan and Israel, is one of three "nuclear threshold states" that have the capability to swiftly build nuclear weapons. New Delhi exploded a nuclear device in 1974, but has not undertaken any nuclear tests since then. 
 Ghose told the CD that New Delhi had led the call for a test ban treaty as far back as 1954, but the Geneva negotiations had ignored their mandate to negotiate a universal, balanced test ban. 
 She was particularly critical of the text's clause on entry-into-force, saying: "It is unprecedented in multilateral negotiations and international law that any sovereign country should be denied its right of voluntary consent on adherence to an international treaty."

 SPAIN: Spain's Petronor refinery shut until Monday. 
 Spain's Petronor refinery shut until Monday. 
 MADRID 1996-08-20 
 
 Petronor, part of the Repsol group, said its refinery in Spain's Basque Country had closed on Monday as expected. 
 Workers called a strike, the sixth this year, from 1500 GMT Monday until 0400 GMT on Monday, August 26. 
 The plant takes about 12 hours to regain full production after a stoppage, the spokesman said. It should therefore  be back to full strength around 1600 GMT next Monday. 
 The refinery has a capacity of 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) but usually refines an average of 200,000 bpd. 
 It will compensate for some of the lost production -- perhaps around half -- by increasing output after the strike, the spokesman said. 
 Other refineries in the Repsol group have also contributed to covering Petronor's shortfall in past strikes.

 BELGIUM: Fourth suspect in Belgian scandal appears in court. 
 Fourth suspect in Belgian scandal appears in court. 
 NEUFCHATEAU, Belgium 1996-08-20 
 
 A Belgian court will decide later on Tuesday whether to formally charge a fourth suspect in a Belgian child sex scandal in which two eight-year old girls have died and at least four others were abducted. 
 "The decision will be this afternoon," said Clement de Clety, lawyer of Brussels businessman Jean-Michel Nihoul who has been detained and faces charges of criminal association. 
 About the charge, de Clety told reporters that the only point was that Nihoul knew Lelievre and Dutroux. 
 "(Nihoul) just gave (them) his car for two or three days to repair it and to pass it on to the technical control authorities. These are the only concrete points in the file, nothing more," de Clety said. 
 Convicted paedophile Marc Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre were formally charged last Friday after police rescued two abducted young girls from a house owned by Dutroux in the southern town of Charleroi. 
 Dutroux led police on Saturday to the buried bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo who died of starvation early this year after being kidnapped in June 1995. 
 Dutroux's wife Michelle Martin was charged on Monday with being an accomplice in the abduction and illegal imprisonment of children. 
 Belgian media said earlier on Tuesday that the Dutch boyfriend of Nihoul's ex-wife had also been arrested. But court sources said the charges against him had been dropped and that he had just been questioned.

 HONG KONG: Hong Kong stocks modestly higher in morning trade. 
 Hong Kong stocks modestly higher in morning trade. 
 HONG KONG 1996-08-20 
 
 Hong Kong stocks were modestly higher in Tuesday morning trade, with gains in the utility and property sectors aiding the general tone of the market, analysts said. 
 The Hang Seng index rose 24.09 points to 11,237.57. Turnover was HK$817 million after the first hour of trade. The Hang Seng properties sub-index added 17.26 points to 21,062.19 and the utilities sub-index rose 76.98 points to 9,547.78. 
 "There is still going to be buying in property counters ahead of their reuslts," said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities. "There is a lot of focus on Hutchison and Cheung Kong which are the most imminent." 
 Shares in Hutchison Whampoa rose HK$0.50 to HK$47.90 and Cheung Kong (Holdings) was steady at HK$56.25. Both companies are due to release their interim results on Thursday. 
 In the utilities sector, China Light rose HK$0.30 to HK$32.80 and Hong Kong Telecom was up HK$0.10 at HK$12.90. "The utilities had been left well behind by the market," said one trader. 
 However, analysts said gains in the market were likely to be capped ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting later on Tuesday. "As the market heads towards the 11,300 level we are still going to meet some resistance," said Rossiter. 
 "The market is likely to be quiet waiting for the FOMC meeting. If there is no change in interest rates, the market should be able to move higher," the trader said. 
 H-shares succumbed to profit-taking after three consecutive winning sessions. The index of Hong Kong-listed mainland China companies fell 12.18 points to 823.34. 
 Shares in Yaohan International Holdings rose HK$0.10 to HK$0.87 after the company said it plans to privatise its loss making unit Yaohan Hongkong Corp Ltd. Shares in Yaohan Hongkong fell HK$0.02 to HK$0.35. 
 Cheung Kong Infrastructure fell HK$0.05 to HK$12.55. The company reported net profit of HK$347.2 million for the first half of 1996.

 NEPAL: Nepal textile mills end strike against tax hike. 
 Nepal textile mills end strike against tax hike.
 KATHMANDU 1996-08-20 
 
 Nepal's textile mills, closed for three weeks in protest against an increase in sales tax, re-opened on Tuesday after the government agreed to review a tax proposal, a senior industry official said. 
 "We will open the factories as the government has agreed to consider some of our policy-related demands," Mahesh Lal Pradhan, president of Nepal Textile Industries' Association (NTIA), told Reuters. 
 More than 200 textile plants closed last month, throwing 20,000 people out of work, after the government raised the sales tax to 15 percent from five percent. The industry wants the government to restore the old rate. 
 Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who is also Finance Minister, had assured the entrepreneurs that he would take care of the interest of factory owners, Pradhan said. 
 Factory owners said the sales tax hike had made Nepali products costlier than textiles imported from India or Tibet. Cheaper textiles were also smuggled in from India, they said. 
 Pradhan said the government had also agreed to make the valuation of imports realistic and take strong measures against smuggling.

 Gains were likely to be limited, brokers said, as market activity was still fairly thin although the peak week for Japanese corporations' summer vacations was over. 
 At 0019 GMT, the 225-share Nikkei average was up 44.21 points or 0.21 percent at 21,150.62. In the futures market, however, the key September futures, were down 50 points at 21,120. 
 "The Nikkei will probably try for the 21,207 level, which is one-third of the way up from its (recent) lows, and after that it may eye the 21,400 to 21,500 level," one broker added.

 BANGLADESH: Traders resent move against used car imports. 
 Traders resent move against used car imports. 
 DHAKA 1996-08-20 
 
 Bangladeshi traders on Monday took issue with a government plan to restrict imports of used cars in its drive against pollution and said it could push up prices. 
 "It's absolutely wrong to put the blame on used imported cars. All re-conditioned Japanese vehicles... are sure to have anti-pollution devices as per Japan's export rule," said Abdul Haque, president of the Bangladesh Re-conditioned Vehicles Importers and Dealers Association. 
 The re-conditioned cars constitute nearly 90 percent of Bangladesh's total car imports. 
 Huque told a news conference the government served notice last month it was going to limit the age of used imported cars to three years, arguing the vehicles are polluting the environment. Currently, importers are allowed to bring in five-year- old used cars. 
 "We are importing the cars that have in-biult anti-pollution devices and are safe," Haque said. 
 He said the government also imposed Value Added Tax (VAT) at a rate of 15 percent on sales of the cars, effective July this year. 
 He warned that the price of re-conditioned cars in local markets might be "doubled or trippled" because of such moves. 
 Bangladesh reduced import duty on car imports to 45 percent from 50 percent in fiscal 1996/97 which began on July 1. The country imported nearly 30,000 re-conditioned cars, mostly from Japan, in 1995-96. 
 The government earned 3.0 billion taka ($71.4 million) as tax revenue from car imports last year.

 CHINA: China issues rules on shipping links with Taiwan. 
 China issues rules on shipping links with Taiwan. 
 BEIJING 1996-08-20 
 
 China has issued a set of regulations governing direct shipping links with Taiwan, the Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday. 
 The regulations take effect today, although Taiwan still bans direct shipping links between the two sides.   
 "The regulations...are meant to promote cargo and passenger transport between the two sides of the Straits and accelerate the development of direct mail service, trade, and air and shipping links across the Straits," Xinhua said. It gave no further details. 
 Hong Kong's Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po newspaper said on Tuesday that the southeastern Chinese cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou would be the first ports to be opened to direct shipping links with Taiwan. 
 The conditions were ripe for establishing direct shipping links between the two sides, the newspaper said. 
 An official of the Ministry of Communications declined to comment on the reports, saying only that China would make a statement through the official media in future. 
 Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the Chinese civil war and fled to the island in 1949.

MEXICO: Recovery excitement brings Mexican markets to life. 
 Recovery excitement brings Mexican markets to life. 
 Henry Tricks 
 MEXICO CITY 
 
 Emerging evidence that Mexico's economy was back on the recovery track sent Mexican markets into a buzz of excitement Tuesday, with stocks closing at record highs and interest rates at 19-month lows. 
 "Mexico has been trying to stage a recovery since the beginning of this year and it's always been getting ahead of itself in terms of fundamentals," said Matthew Hickman of Lehman Brothers in New York. 
 "Now we're at the point where the fundamentals are with us. The history is now falling out of view." 
 That history is one etched into the minds of all investors in Mexico: an economy in crisis since December 1994, a free-falling peso and stubbornly high interest rates. 
 This week, however, second-quarter gross domestic product was reported up 7.2 percent, much stronger than most analysts had expected. Interest rates on governent Treasury bills, or Cetes, in the secondary market fell on Tuesday to 23.90 percent, their lowest level since Jan. 25, 1995. 
 The stock market's main price index rallied 77.12 points, or 2.32 percent, to a record 3,401.79 points, with volume at a frenzied 159.89 million shares. 
 Confounding all expectations has been the strength of the peso, which ended higher in its longer-term contracts on Tuesday despite the secondary Cetes drop and expectations of lower benchmark rates in Tuesday's weekly auction. 
 With U.S. long-term interest rates expected to remain steady after the Federal Reserve refrained from raising short-term rates on Tuesday, the attraction of Mexico, analysts say, is that it offers robust returns for foreigners and growing confidence that they will not fall victim to a crumbling peso. 
 "The focus is back on Mexican fundamentals," said Lars Schonander, head of researcher at Santander in Mexico City. "You have a continuing decline in inflation, a stronger-than-expected GDP growth figure and the lack of any upward move in U.S. rates." 
 Other factors were also at play, said Felix Boni, head of research at James Capel in Mexico City, such as positive technicals and economic uncertainty in Argentina, which has put it and neighbouring Brazil's markets at risk. 
 "There's a movement out of South American markets into Mexico," he said. But Boni was also wary of what he said could be "a lot of hype." 
 The economic recovery was still export-led, and evidence was patchy that the domestic consumer was back with a vengeance. Also, corporate earnings need to grow strongly to justify the run-up in the stock market, he said.

 USA: Chrysler plans new investments in Latin America. 
 Chrysler plans new investments in Latin America. 
 David Lawder 
 AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 1996-08-20 
 
 Chrysler Corp. Tuesday announced $380 million in new investments for South America, including assembly plants for pickup trucks and diesel engines in Brazil and the expansion of a Jeep plant now being built in Argentina. 
 Chrysler, which is cautiously trying to rebuild its international presence, said the projects in Brazil were worth about $315 million, and the expansion in Argentina was worth about $65 million. 
 Roughly one third of the total investment, or about $126.6 million, will come from Chrysler's suppliers, who will play a major role in the automaker's low-risk global growth strategy, Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said. 
 "We don't intend to make risky investments just to be a major player in emerging markets," added Thomas Gale, Chrysler's executive vice president of international operations. "We're quite content to grow at a steady pace in regions where we see solid opportunities." 
 Eaton said the investments will boost Chrysler's sales in the Mercosur free-trade zone, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
 But the company's limited production capacity will allow it only to grab a small portion of the Mercosur market away from rivals General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, he said. 
 "We are targeting very specific market segments," he said. "We don't have any interest or desire to offer a vehicle for every possible application." 
 The new Brazilian plant, which will be Chrysler's third limited-production facility in South America, will assemble the automaker's all-new Dakota compact pickup truck for sale in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the countries in the Mercosur free-trade zone. 
 In Argentina, Chrysler said it will add production of about 6,000 Jeep Cherokees a year at a plant now under construction in the Cordoba province. The plant is already scheduled to build about 14,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees per year starting next April, and Cherokee output will begin in 1998. 
 A site for the Brazilian plant will be selected by year-end and vehicles will roll off the assembly line starting in mid-1998, Chrysler said. Production, however, will be modest, with 12,000 trucks in the first year and an ultimate capacity of 40,000 units annually. Employment will start at 400 people. 
 The trucks at first will be largely assembled from "complete knock-down" kits shipped from the United States, but the automaker intends to meet the Mercosur trade bloc's 60 percent local content requirement after three years. 
 Chrysler has not decided whether to market the Dakota under the Dodge brand name or under one of its other brands. The automaker now uses the only Jeep and Chrysler brand names outside the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
 The $315 million Brazil investment also includes a new diesel engine plant to be built by Detroit Diesel Corp.. 
 The $10 million facility will supply the company's Italian-designed VM Motori four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines for use in the Brazilian Dakota as well as in Jeep models built in Argentina. Chrysler installs about 40,000 of the engines annually into minivans and Jeep Grand Cherokees sold in Europe. 
 Others suppliers supporting the Chrysler by opening plants in Latin America include Dana Corp., Johnson Controls Inc., Lear Corp., Lear Corp. United Technologies Corp. and PPG Industries Inc., Chrysler executives said. 
 Eaton said total annual vehicle sales in the four-country Mercosur region will increase from about 2 million units currently to about 2.5 million by the end of the decade. 
 "We think this is a major growth area," Eaton said. "It's politically and economically a stable region, we think with particularly rising consumer buying power." 
 Including a small plant in Venezuela that assembles Cherokees and Neon small cars from kits, the investments announced Tuesday bring to $735 million the total financial commitments Chrysler and its suppliers have made in South America, the company said. 
 Chrysler stock rose 25 cents to close at $28.875 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

 USA: CompuServe reports loss, cutting work force. 
 CompuServe reports loss, cutting work force. 
 Susan Zimmerman 
 COLUMBUS, Ohio 1996-08-20 
 
 CompuServe Corp. Tuesday reported a surprisingly large $29.6 million fiscal first-quarter loss, blaming a decline in the number of subscribers to the No. 2 online service and spending on a new family-oriented service and improvements. 
 CompuServe predicted a second-quarter loss but said earnings would improve in the second half of the fiscal year. 
 "We are taking steps to revitalise CompuServe," said Chief Executive Bob Massey. 
 The company said it would cut 150 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, as part of a cost-cutting programme expected to save $30 million on an annualized basis. 
 The Columbus, Ohio-based company said that as part of the cost cuts it would sell its Spry Inc. unit, whose Web browser trails far behind similar products made by Netscape Communications Corp. and Microsoft Corp. 
 The loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, in the company's fiscal 1997 first quarter ended July 31 compared with last year's quarterly profit of $26.8 million, or 36 cents a share. The results included a pretax charge of $17.7 million, or 13 cents per share. 
 CompuServe last month said it expected to post a loss for the quarter, but the actual loss was greater than Wall Street expectations. 
 The company reported revenues of $208.6 million for the quarter vs. $186.5 million in the previous year's quarter. 
 Massey, expanding on last month's comments, said the number of people cancelling their subscriptions exceeded the 900,000 new subscribers to the company's online services, producing a "modest decline" in subscriber numbers. 
 As of July 31, the company's flagship CompuServe Information Service had 3.3 million members worldwide, the company said. Total subscribers, including members of NiftyServe, a joint-venture Japanese online service, numbered 5.2 million. 
 CompuServe, founded in 1969, is second only to America Online Inc., with 6.2 million subscribers. 
 CompuServe also blamed the loss on investments in its family-oriented WOW! service and infrastructure improvements. 
 It said it expected losses to continue into the second fiscal quarter, hitting 10 cents to 15 cents a share, due to the costs of rolling out the latest version of the software needed to access the service, Compuserve 3.0, and the release of a feature that makes WOW! look different to teenagers than it does to their parents. 
 But the forecast for the second half of its fiscal year was rosier. 
 "Coupled with new product releases and aggressive marketing campaigns, we expect the third and fourth quarters to improve with subscribers topping the 7-million mark, including our Japanese licensee service, NiftyServe," Massey said in a statement. 
 The company said it also expected increased revenue from advertising and fees for electronic commerce. 
 CompuServe is a former subsidiary of tax preparer H&R Block Inc., which spun off the company and is selling its 80 percent stake in CompuServe. 
 CompuServe announced its financial results after markets closed. Its stock dropped 12.5 cents to $13.50 on Nasdaq in earlier trading.

 USA: Hog prices tumble as supplies increase, cocoa gains. 
 Hog prices tumble as supplies increase, cocoa gains. 
 CHICAGO 
 
 Hog prices fell Tuesday after government slaughter figures showed supplies were increasing, while cocoa futures rose on anticipation of smaller crops overseas. 
 Forecasts for shrinking deliverable supplies pulled coffee prices up. Crude oil fell after rising on Monday. Gold edged higher. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 futures contracts closed down 1.32 at 250.65 points. 
 At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, August hog and pork belly futures finished down their respective daily limits on pressure from increased hog slaughter and weakness in the cash market. 
 "The fact that we are seeing a few more hogs show up has people worried about the supply side but more important than this it gives the packers a little more freedom to improve their margins," said Doug Harper, Brock Associates Inc. senior livestock analyst. 
 High hog prices have pinched profits at meat-packing companies and now that hog supplies are increasing these companies will likely be quick to lower bids. 
 The Agriculture Department reported Tuesday's slaughter at 348,000 head vs. 343,000 a week ago. Also, on a weekly basis, slaughter is nearing last year's higher levels. 
 The CME August hog contract closed down the 1.50-cent-per-pound daily limit at 60.025 cents per pound. 
 Pork bellies also closed sharply lower because more hogs translates to more pork and lower pork prices. CME August pork bellies closed down the 2-cent limit at 91.375 cents per pound. 
 Cocoa futures at New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange ended sharply higher on speculative buying, but the market has been buoyed by news of smaller overseas crops. 
 One analyst said until updated Ivory Coast crop estimates emerged near the end of August, the December contract was likely to range between $1,400 and $1,500. 
 December cocoa settled up $21 to $1,430 per metric ton. 
 "The smaller Ivorian crop is well anticipated," the analyst said. "There are other countries having problems, such as ... Ghana." 
 Preliminary forecasts, which pegged the 1996/97 Ivory Coast crop around 800,000 to 900,000 metric tons, have been largely factored into the market, he said, and barring sharp revisions, news from other cocoa producing countries could become the focus. 
 Coffee prices ended higher after a burst of late-session chart-based buying. 
 December coffee settled at 115.05 cents per pound Tuesday, up 1.75 on the day and just above the widely-watched 115 cents mark. Traders said the break through that resistance level could inspire some additional chart-driven buying Wednesday. 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil and refined products futures closed lower on profit-taking. 
 September unleaded gasoline closed down 1.26 cents a gallon to 64.01 cents, and September heating fell 0.91 cent a gallon to 61.67 cents. 
 September crude oil fell 40 cents to $22.86 a barrel. 
 September gold added 50 cents to close at $388.60 an ounce at New York's Commodity Exchange.

 USA: Blue chips end up as Fed keeps interest rates steady. 
 Blue chips end up as Fed keeps interest rates steady. 
 NEW YORK 

 Blue-chip stocks rallied Tuesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, the dollar rose after a drop in the June trade deficit, and bonds ended little changed. 
 Crude oil fell after rising on Monday. Gold edged higher. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.82 points at 5,721.26, putting the blue-chip index within a stone's throw of its record closing high of 5,778.00 set on May 22. 
 In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,230 to 1,068 on moderate volume of 334 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee ended its meeting in early afternoon and kept interest rates unchanged, allowing Wall Street to hurdle any lingering fears of a surprise increase. 
 "It was as expected. If we can neutralise the interest rate factor here, prices can go higher," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. 
 The Fed had been expected to hold interest rates steady amid signs the economy was slowing after strong second quarter growth without inflation heating up. 
 But investors still preferred to hold back until the policy-makers announced that they were keeping short term rates unchanged. 
 The independent Fed also sought to stay out of the line of political fire in the approach to the Nov. 5 presidential and congressional elections. 
 After growing at its fastest pace in two years in the second quarter, the economy looks to have slowed recently as the housing market has weakened and retail sales have stalled. 
 Blue-chips actually pared their gains shortly after the Fed news. 
 "For a few seconds it looked like the buy the rumour, sell the fact. But then the Dow came back up and it's hard to find any indices doing anything spectacular," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. 
 "It's a Dow-inspired rally and in some ways because of the liquidity factor, visibility and safety," he added. 
 Meanwhile, weakness in high-technology stocks pressured the technology-studded Nasdaq composite index, which closed down 6.24 points at 1,124.67. 
 In currency markets, the dollar climbed above 108 yen after the Commerce Department reported the United States trade gap shrank 23 percent in June as imports of merchandise and petroleum fell sharply. 
 While the trade shortfall with Japan rose 3.6 percent in June, the second-quarter deficit of $10.5 billion with Japan was the smallest quarterly deficit in five years. 
 The trend boosted the dollar since it decreased the amount of dollars foreign exporters will need to sell for their local currencies. 
 "It was a good trade number," said Greg Pearman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Credit Commerciale de France in New York. "There was definitely one huge buyer today who right after the (trade) number bought a lot of dollars for yen." 
 Late in New York, the dollar settled at 108.35 yen, up from 107.80 yen late on Monday. The dollar rose slightly to 1.4883 German marks from 1.4880 marks. 
 In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury ended unchanged at 6.80 percent. 
 Crude oil for September delivery lost 40 cents to $22.86 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange. September gold added 50 cents to close at $388.60 an ounce at New York's Commodity Exchange. 
 Overseas, Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 19.5 points to a record 3,883.2, surpassing the old mark of 3,872.9 set just last week. Japan's 225-share Nikkei average rose 20.60 points to 21,127.01.

 USA: Sprint to offer consumer Internet access service. 
 Sprint to offer consumer Internet access service. 
 Susan Nadeau 
 CHICAGO 
 
 Sprint Corp. Tuesday announced plans to offer Internet access to consumers, jumping into the market to help millions of homes go online after similar moves by rivals AT&T and MCI. 
 Kansas City, Mo.-based Sprint, which has operated a big chunk of the Internet for American businesses since 1992, said it would offer the service for free to 200,000 of its existing telephone customers until it is introduced widely in the fall. 
 After that, consumers will be able to choose a flat rate of $19.95 a month for unlimited access, or $1.50 an hour with no minimum or maximum usage requirement, the nation's third-largest long-distance company said. 
 "We've been in the Internet, in fact profitable and making money in the Internet business, longer than anybody," said Jim Dodd, vice president of Internet Access Services for Sprint. 
 Industry analysts said Sprint took its time getting into the consumer side of the Internet access business to avoid some of the service glitches that have hurt its larger rivals. 
 "Some others got not very good press," said Bette Massick Colombo at Bear Stearns & Co. "The fact that they are taking their time is okay. I don't think they've lost ground." 
 Sprint said the service, dubbed Sprint Internet Passport, will provide around-the-clock access to the global computer network with a local phone call in 212 cities to start, and in more than 300 cities by year-end. 
 The offering compares with the services rolled out by AT&T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. as well as regional Bell operating companies earlier this year. 
 AT&T's entry into the market, which included some free access time, sparked a flurry of competition that sent shockwaves through the consumer Internet access business. 
 Sprint's service initially will support only the Netscape Navigator search software, but Dodd said the company was taking with Microsoft about including its Explorer "browser" software as well. 
 "In our first release we won't support the Microsoft browser, but we expect them to be a part of our service shortly," Dodd said. 
 In 1992, Sprint became the first long-distance company to offer commercial Internet service, and now offers access to more than 1,000 Internet service providers and to a host of other businesses. Sprint also provides on-line access for most major proprietary online services. 
 Sprint has $12.8 billion in annual revenues and serves more than 15 million business and residential customers. 
 It said its offerings would also include Netscape Navigator, a rebate certificate for a high-speed modem, access speeds of up to 14.4 and 28.8 kilobits per second, a dedicated Web site with e-mail, news, directory and search services, and technical support online or through a toll-free 800 number. 
 Credit card billing will be offered. 
 Sprint stock fell 50 cents to $39 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 USA: Back-to-school spending is up. 
 Back-to-school spending is up. 
 Patricia Commins 
 CHICAGO 
 
 Shoppers are loading up this year on perennial back-to-school favourites such as jeans, shirts and sneakers, with parents spending an average of 12 percent more for clothing and other supplies. 
 "It's sort of funny because it really hasn't changed a lot from years ago, with jeans, shirts and pants and things like that being the basics of what people are looking for," said Andrea Kent, director of the Retail Marketing Group for American Express Travel Related Services Inc. 
 Overall, back-to-school spending will rise a projected 12 percent to an average of $363 per child, American Express said in its second annual survey of 1,000 shoppers. 
 The spending increase was caused by an emphasis on brand-name goods that typically cost more, lower retailer inventories which reduce the amount of discounted, sale merchandise, and higher consumer confidence, American Express said. 
 It added that 18 percent of parents say they planned to spend $500 or more per child on back-to-school items such as clothing, supplies, textbooks and electronics. 
 Across the board, clothing accounts for the highest portion of the back-to-school budget. The percentage is highest for elementary students, at 66 percent of the budget, and high school students, at 63 percent. For college students, clothing accounts for 33 percent of the budget, followed closely behind by textbooks at 25 percent. 
 "College students have a much greater demand for other items... Textbooks is a very high expense for college students, accounting for 25 percent of their back-to-school budget," Kent said. 
 Curiously, the American Express survey found that college boys are dramatically more style-conscious than college girls, a finding that was contrary to last year's results. 
 Among the retailers, department stores are battling speciality shops for back-to-school sales, with discount department stores getting a large portion of the sales. 
 Back-to-school -- the second largest selling season for retailers -- has taken on even more importance since the all-important holiday season between Thanksgiving and Christmas is five days shorter this year. 
 "The department stores are back with a bang... They are fighting for the purse, hearts and minds of the mall-brats, and they are flexing their fashion muscles," said Alan Millstein, president of Fashion Network Inc., a New York-based retail consultant. 
 The American Express survey showed discount department stores are capturing 35 percent of sales, followed by malls at 29 percent and department stores at 26 percent. Other retail locations, such as factory outlets and office supply stores, accounted for 10 percent. 
 The decision of where to shop is mostly left up to parents, the survey revealed, while the children had the most influence over what to buy. 
 "If you let your kids pick out what ... to buy, they are more likely to want to wear it," Kent said. "Back when I was a kid, my mom took me shopping and she picked out what she liked for me." 
 What kids are picking out are jeans, with the Levi Strauss & Co.'s Levi brand being the most popular, Kent added. 
 Jeans are also an important draw for department stores trying to lure high school and college students, with offerings that include designer jeans from Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren Polo and Calvin Klein. 
 Millstein added that low-slung, hip-hugging jeans with bell bottoms are big sellers. 
 "Anything that has a ... retro look of the peace march is back in fashion and selling," Millstein said. 
 Among the hot-selling items at Target, the discount department store chain owned by Dayton Hudson Corp., are T-shirts and accessories, such as clay rings and necklaces, that are reminiscent of the 1970s, according to Dayton Hudson spokeswoman Susan Eich. 
 Other popular items include jumper's for girls, backpacks, clogs and "anything with zippers," Eich added.

 USA: Kansas, Arizona add to suits against tobacco firms. 
 Kansas, Arizona add to suits against tobacco firms. 
 Greg Frost 
 KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1996-08-20 
 
 Kansas and Arizona filed lawsuits against some of the biggest tobacco firms Tuesday, joining a growing list of states seeking to recover hundreds of millions of dollars for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. 
 At the same time, sources said that Michigan and Oklahoma were preparing to file similar lawsuits this week, bringing to 14 the total number of states suing the industry. 
 Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall called tobacco "the most lethal consumer product ever sold" and said her state's lawsuit was warranted because of the "enormous financial burden" that the tobacco industry had shifted to Kansas taxpayers. 
 Philip Morris Cos. Inc., one of nine tobacco companies named in the suit, said it would vigorously defend itself against the suit, which it said had no basis in law. 
 Meanwhile, aides to Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley said he would file a suit against tobacco companies on Wednesday while legal sources said Oklahoma would file suit Thursday. 
 In Indianapolis, meanwhile, another liability challenge to the tobacco industry headed toward a decision. 
 A jury was expected to begin deliberations Wednesday or Thursday in the case of Richard Rogers, an Indianapolis lawyer who began smoking at age 6 and died of lung cancer 46 years later. Rogers' widow and teen-age children are seeking unspecified damages. 
 Also on Tuesday, New York City's public advocate urged Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to sue the tobacco industry to recover what the city paid out for health care costs of smokers. 
 Public Advocate Mark Green said the city should join the group of states and the city of San Francisco in their efforts to obtain Medicaid refunds from cigarette companies. 
 The Rogers case in Indianapolis is similar to hundreds that have been filed across the country. Earlier this month in Jacksonville, Fla., a jury awarded $750,000 to a man who smoked for 44 years before he was stricken with lung cancer. 
 In that case the jury said the Lucky Strikes he smoked were a defective product and that cigarette maker Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., a unit of Britain's B.A.T. Industries Plc, was negligent by failing to inform the public about the health risks of smoking. 
 The company said it will appeal the jury decision. 
 The Kansas lawsuit only listed damages in excess of $50,000, but Stovall said the actual figure would probably run to hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 "During the course of discovery we'll be able to come up with a finite amount of money that we're claiming in terms of damages, but it's hundreds of millions of dollars ... for what the state has paid out in Medicaid," Stovall said. 
 Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods said his state was seeking more than $300 million in damages related to costs Arizona incurred in Medicaid costs for smokers' illnesses. 
 Stovall said the Kansas lawsuit suit was the broadest to date because it sought to force tobacco firms to pay for programs aimed at educating children about the hazards of smoking. 
 Named as defendants in the Kansas suit were RJR Nabisco Holding Corp.'s RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co.; B.A.T. and its divisions Brown & Williamson and The American Tobacco Co.; Philip Morris Co., Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Tobacco Co. Inc.; the public relations firm Hill and Knowlton, the Council for Tobacco Research, and the Tobacco Institute. 
 The Arizona suit also named Brooke Group Ltd.'s Liggett Group Inc. as a defendant.

 USA: Chains may raise prices after minimum wage hike. 
 Chains may raise prices after minimum wage hike. 
 Patricia Commins 
 CHICAGO 
 
 The higher minimum wage signed into law Tuesday will be welcome relief for millions of workers, but it may also translate into higher prices for hamburgers, pizzas and other fast-food items, some restaurant chains said. 
 The 90-cent-an-hour increase will have little short-term impact on many fast-food chains that already pay workers rates above the federally mandated minimum. 
 But in the long run, industry officials fear that workers already earning above the new minimum wage, which will rise to $5.15 an hour next year, will be looking for more. 
 "What we're concerned about is the ripple effect it brings," said Bruce Cotton, chief spokesman for Long John Silver's Restaurants Inc. in Lexington, Ky. 
 "Our average crew wage is about $5.20 (an hour) so short-term there is not going to be any impact," said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc., which operates about 4,300 restaurants in the United States. 
 President Clinton signed into law the first increase in the minimum wage in five years, boosting it by 50 cents to $4.75 on Oct. 1 and 40 cents more to $5.15 on Sept. 1, 1997. 
 The White House estimates the new law will mean a raise for about 10 million American workers, many of them in restaurants and stores. 
 Most small businesses had opposed the increase, saying it would prompt them to hire fewer people, particularly young people looking for entry-level jobs. 
 But some economists argued that the negative effects of an increase in the wage, first imposed by the federal government in 1938 at 25 cents an hour, would be minimal. 
 To help get the bill through the Republican-controlled Congress, a package of about $22 billion in tax breaks aimed mostly at small businesses was added to the measure. 
 As a result of the higher minimum wage, American Restaurant Partners L.P., which operates 62 Pizza Hut restaurant franchises, expects its total wage costs will rise $500,000 over the next 12 months. 
 "If you raise someone who started in the last two months (to the new minimum wage level), you also have to raise everybody else," said Terry Freund, chief financial officer of American Restaurant Partners. 
 To compensate, the Wichita, Kan.-based restaurant operator hopes to raise prices by about 3 percent. The risk, Freund added, is that higher prices will keep some customers away or prompt them to scale back on the pizzas or other items they normally order. 
 Beyond the minimum wage requirements, competition for workers -- from cooks to delivery drivers to counter staff -- has forced many fast-food chains to pay up to hire good help, particularly in metropolitan markets. That competition is being driven by an increase in restaurant openings, particularly fast-food and casual dining establishments. 
 "There are neighbourhoods where we have to pay $6.00 an hour to $6.50 or $7.00 to get" good workers, Wendy's Lynch said. "The competition is setting the wage." 
 Fast-food industry executives said there has been competition for workers since the late 1980s, although the increase in restaurant openings is making the search for employees more intense. 
 Another problem for fast-food chains is wage competition from other employers. A fast-food worker, for example, may be able to earn $50 or $60 a night in tips at a casual dining establishment, executives said. 
 "For QSRs (quick service restaurants) ... it's even tougher to keep the kids," said Roger Lipton, president of Lipton Financial Services.

 Blue-chip stocks bounded higher Tuesday as the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged removed a possible roadblock to the market's continued rally. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.82 points at 5,721.26, putting the blue-chip index within a stone's throw of its record closing high of 5,778.00 set on May 22.

 Tobacco stocks were mostly higher, despite news that Kansas became the 11th state and Arizona the 12th to sue the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid costs of smokers. Philip Morris rose 1-5/8 to 91-1/2, RJR Nabisco slipped 1/4 to 26-1/2, smokeless tobacco maker UST rose 1/8 to 31-3/4, Loews added 1/4 to 77-7/8.

 USA: U.S. Federal Reserve holds interest rates steady. 
 U.S. Federal Reserve holds interest rates steady. 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent 
 The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Tuesday amid signs the economy was slowing from its burst of growth in the second quarter without inflation heating up. 
 The decision by the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had been widely expected and left the key federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for short-term loans unchanged at 5.25 percent. 
 "The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 12:45 p.m (1645 GMT). There is no further announcement," central bank spokesman Joseph Coyne said in a brief statement. 
 Stock prices rose after the Fed announcement, with the Dow Jones industrial average adding 21.82 points to 5,721.26. While the decision had been expected, analysts said investors were relieved nonetheless. Bond prices ended little changed. 
 The decision to hold rates steady kept the Fed out of the line of political fire ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential and congressional elections. 
 "If the Fed had raised interest rates now, given the rather benign inflation data we've seen, there would have been a political lynch mob at the central bank," said Ken Mayland, chief economist for St. Louis-based banking group KeyCorp. 
 After growing at its fastest pace in two years in the second quarter, the economy appears to have slowed recently as the housing market has weakened and retail sales have stalled. 
 Most analysts expect the economy to slow further later this year. But it remains an open question whether it will slow enough to keep inflation in check. 
 That means a precautionary rate rise is possible later in the year, once the Fed has more evidence to help it measure how much the expansion is slowing, economists said. 
 More than half of 29 economists surveyed by Reuters Tuesday week forecast a rate increase by the end of the year. 
 The Fed holds its next policy-making meeting on Sept. 24. Since cutting rates by a quarter point in January, the central bank has held rates steady as growth first waned, then waxed. 
 David Jones, vice chairman of Wall Street broker Aubrey G. Lanston and Co., said the Fed will face a tougher task next month, in part because of a potential pickup in inflation. 
 But he too is betting that the central bank will not raise rates until later in the year. "Fed officials would probably like to push out any decision beyond the election," he said. 
 Tuesday's Fed meeting was sandwiched between the Republican Party's presidential nominating convention last week in San Diego and the Democrats' next week in Chicago. 
 A rate rise ahead of the election would not be good news for President Clinton in his drive to win re-election, although it would likely have little immediate impact on the economy that still has considerable momentum. 
 The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter -- about twice the speed most economists reckon is sustainable on a long-term basis without fanning inflation. 
 The jobs market has remained strong, putting extra money in workers' pockets and portending continued solid consumer spending. 
 At 5.4 percent, the unemployment rate is hovering just above a six-year low and near levels that in the past have forced employers to bid up wages to attract workers, feeding inflation. 
 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told lawmakers last month that wage increases had been held in check by workers' worries that they might lose their jobs. But he warned that those fears would eventually fade and said the central bank needed to remain vigilant to prevent a wage-driven rise in inflation.

 USA: Lloyd's CEO questioned in recovery suit in U.S.. 
 Lloyd's CEO questioned in recovery suit in U.S.. 
 Lorrie Grant 
 RICHMOND, Va. 1996-08-20 
 
 Ronald Sandler, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, on Tuesday underwent a second day of court interrogation about the 300-year-old insurance market's multibillion-dollar recovery plan, which he defended as critical to Lloyd's solvency. 
 Sandler was questioned for four hours in a federal courtroom by lawyers for American investors in Lloyd's and by U.S. District Judge Robert Payne about Lloyd's complex restructuring plan to settle large losses. 
 Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide -- quaintly known as Names -- were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case, in which 100 U.S. investors have applied for an injunction to block the recovery plan. 
 Under the rescue proposal, Lloyd's was to reinsure billions of dollars in liabilities, including pollution and asbestosis-related claims in the United States, in a new company called Equitas. 
 The proposal also includes a 3.2 billion pound ($4.95 billion) cash offer to the Names designed to offset the cost of Equitas. The investors must vote on the plan by Aug. 28. 
 The suit, which names 93 plaintiffs, seeks to block the plan until more detailed financial information is released. It contends that Lloyd's has breached U.S. disclosure laws. 
 Sandler, as he did on Monday, said the plan was crucial to Lloyd's solvency. 
 Payne questioned Sandler for about an hour, asking about Lloyd's plans to pay its liabilities and what would happen if its investments made more money than was needed to pay off those liabilities. 
 "Most (Lloyd's officials) believe that some time over 30 years the liability will be extinguished," Sandler said, adding that any money left over would go to charities. 
 When asked by the judge who the benefactors would be, Sandler said he was not able to answer. 
 Payne told Sandler firmly that the company needed to have a plan for the disposition of leftover assets and that he would need to be told who the benefactors would be. 
 Payne also asked whether Lloyd's was able to pay the total premium if U.S. investors did not back the recovery plan. Sandler again said he was unable to answer. 
 The proceedings resumed in the afternoon after a break for lunch. 
 Payne earlier criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws. 
 The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the SEC's neutral position on this issue. Payne said the SEC would have a second opportunity to respond to his request for a ruling. 
 Separately Tuesday morning, Lloyd's received a boost from another court case in New York, which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names. 
 They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names. 
 "We are pleased by this decision. Names entered into their commitments under U.K. law and we are pleased that U.S. courts continue to recognise this," said Lloyd's U.S. executive, Peter Lane.

 Ohio Blue Cross approves $299.5 mln Columbia/HCA deal. 
 CLEVELAND 
 
 Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.'s proposed $299.5 million acquisition of most of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ohio cleared a hurdle Tuesday when the health insurer's policyholders approved the deal at a special meeting, Blue Cross said. 
 About 60 protestors outside the meeting outnumbered the 38 who attended it. Most proxies were mailed in advance of the meeting, a Blue Cross spokesman said. 
 Protestors, carrying signs reading, "Stop the Merger," said they represented retirees, trade union members and others. Blue Cross is currently a not-for-profit entity. 
 Blue Cross and Columbia have said the acquisition will reduce health care costs and improve care. 
 "This could be a role model for the entire country," Blue Cross Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Burry said at the meeting. "This an opportunity to get doctors, hospitals and insurers to work together for the benefit of the patient." 
 Questions about the deal have been raised by consumer activists, some policyholders, the Ohio attorney general, the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and others. 
 Last week, Ohio Congressman Sherrod Brown said he asked the Federal Trade Commission to review the proposal. 
 Brown said he was concerned that the merger could reduce competition and restrain trade. He said he was also concerned that all Blue Cross patients might be treated at hospitals owned by Columbia. 
 Columbia is the largest U.S. hospital chain, with 349 hospitals, including three in northeast Ohio, Blue Cross's coverage area. Columbia revenues last year were $17.7 billion. 
 The health insurer has 64,000 policyholders, insures 1.5 million people and generates $2 billion in annual premiums. 
 Under the joint venture agreement, Columbia will form a new company to acquire most of the insurer's operating businesses. 
 Blue Cross will continue to operate, providing reinsurance, guaranteeing policies written by the new company and retaining most national accounts. A federal employee programme will be retained by Blue Cross but managed by the new company, Columbia and Blue Cross said.

 USA: War hero Colin Powell hits road with Dole campaign. 
 War hero Colin Powell hits road with Dole campaign. 
 Joanne Kenen 
 LOUISVILLE, Ky 1996-08-20 
 
 Gulf War hero Colin Powell lent his prestige and popularity to the Republican presidential ticket on Tuesday, making a surprise appearance alongside Bob Dole and Jack Kemp as they campaigned among U.S. war veterans for a strong national defence. 
 The Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Kentucky was a natural setting for Powell, a retired general who helped lead U.S. troops to victory in Operation Desert Storm in the Gulf, and for Bob Dole, who nearly died in the Second World War. 
 "One of the great lessons of history is that if America is prepared to fight many wars and greater wars and any wars that come, then we will fight fewer wars and lesser wars and perhaps no wars at all," said Dole. 
 Dole accused the Clinton administration of spending too little on modernising U.S. forces and meeting the needs of U.S. troops. He said nearly 17,000 junior enlisted personnel needed food stamps to make ends meet last year. 
 "That should not happen if you wear the American uniform," Dole said in a speech that outlined his career-long commitment to veterans. 
 Powell, apparently trying to keep the spotlight on the Republican candidate and not on rumours that he may be secretary of state in a Dole administration, said he and Dole "haven't had any discussion" about a cabinet post and the priority now was to "get the team elected." 
 With his well-received speech at the Republican convention in San Diego last week, the retired general and best-selling author helped the party project an image of tolerance and inclusion. Republicans hope Powell, a moderate on social issues, can reel in the independents Dole needs if he is to oust President Bill Clinton from the White House on Nov. 5. 
 Powell had to remind well-wishers who had come out to greet Dole at the Louisville airport, "I'm not running for anything." Introducing Dole at the VFW rally, he praised him as a champion of a strong defence who "proudly wears a purple heart" for his war wounds and "now offers himself for service as the leader of this great nation." 
 "His vision includes providing leadership to the world in a way that will reassure and comfort our friends and put our enemies on clear notice that we have the strength and the will to defend ourselves and to defend our interests," he added. 
 Before heading back to Washington, Dole, Kemp and Powell, who were not accompanied by their wives on Tuesday, paid a brief visit to the Ladies Auxiliary meeting at a nearby auditorium where the women had been unable to see or hear the main event. 
 "They've never come to the ladies before, this is a first, first, first," said a delighted Marion Watson, from Louisville, chuckling as the former Kansas senator told the crowd, "You'll get a tax cut whether you want one or not." 
 Opinion polls show that the harmonious Republican convention and the energy Kemp infused into the campaign helped Dole cut into Clinton's lead, although Clinton, who at 50 is 23 years younger than Dole, still was ahead and the latest polls showed the gap widening again, to 12 points. 
 Dole and his running mate Kemp have made the economy the centrepiece of their joint campaign, pledging to cut income taxes by 15 percent and balance the federal budget without harming veterans or the elderly. But they have given scant details of how they plan to do that. 
 "It's simply a matter of presidential will. If you've got it, you can do it, and I've got it and I will do it,"  said Dole, who in his 35 years in Congress took part in many budget struggles.

 USA: Clinton signs law raising minimum wage to $5.15. 
 Clinton signs law raising minimum wage to $5.15. 
 Arshad Mohammed 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 President Bill Clinton gave millions of Americans a raise on Tuesday, signing into law a bill to increase the minimum wage for the first time in five years, by 90 cents an hour to $5.15 over two years. 
 "For many this bill will make the difference between their ability to keep their families together and their failure to do so," Clinton said as he signed the bill surrounded by workers who earn the minimum wage and their children. 
 "It's about time they got a reward and today they'll get it," the president added. 
 The bill boosts the wage typically paid to unskilled workers in restaurants and stores by 50 cents to $4.75 on Oct. 1 and by 40 cents to $5.15 on Sept. 1, 1997. It sugarcoats the pill for the mostly small businesses that will pay the higher labour costs by handing them $22 billion in tax breaks over 10 years, paying for this in part by reimposing a 10 percent tax on airline tickets. 
 The passage of the minimum wage boost is a victory for Clinton, who called for the measure when he ran for president in 1992, and his fellow Democrats who forced the legislation through Congress over the objections of many Republicans. 
 "This is a truly remarkable piece of legislation. It is pro-work, pro-business and pro-family," Clinton said in the elaborate signing ceremony on the White House south lawn. 
 "This is a cause for celebration for all Americans of all parties, of all walks of life, all faiths," he added. "We have made this a real season of achievement for America." 
 But there were no leaders of the Republican-led Congress that passed the minimum wage legislation on hand as Clinton signed the bill into law. 
 In a ceremony with great fanfare including music played by the U.S. Marine band, Clinton walked to the podium through two parallel columns of American flags with the White House perfectly framed behind him. 
 After signing the bill with minimum wage workers and their children posed around him, he carried a small girl in a pink dress in his arms as he walked through the crowd greeting people.

 USA: Kansas files lawsuit against tobacco companies. 
 Kansas files lawsuit against tobacco companies. 
 TOPEKA, Kan. 1996-08-20 
 
 Kansas and Arizona filed lawsuits Tuesday against major tobacco companies to recover Medicaid costs for smoking-related illnesses, joining a growing list of states and cities taking on Big Tobacco in court. 
 Kansas became the 11th state and Arizona the 12th to join the anti-tobacco litigation. 
 Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall told a news conference her state's lawsuit was the broadest filed to date. 
 Stovall said that, in addition to trying to recover Medicaid costs, she would seek to require companies to stop marketing products to children, to disclose their knowledge of nicotine addiction, to publish corrective advertising and to fund a public education campaign on smoking. 
 Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods said his state was seeking more than $300 million in damages related to Medicaid costs Arizona has incurred in providing health care to indigent residents with alleged tobacco-related illnesses. 
 Woods said the tobacco companies have engaged in a "massive illegal conspiracy" representing that smoking is not addictive. 
 Arizona's lawsuit also alleged the companies violated antitrust, consumer fraud and fair trade practices. 
 In addition to the monetary damages, Arizona's lawsuit also asks the court to prohibit the companies from targeting children in their advertising, promotion and sales. 
 Woods alleged that tobacco products kill an estimated 5,000 Arizona residents a year. 
 Among the defendants in the two lawsuits were RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., Philip Morris Cos. Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Co. Inc., American Tobacco Co., public relations firm Hill and Knowlton Inc., the Council for Tobacco Research, and the Tobacco Institute.

 Oil prices slip as refiners shop for bargains. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 World oil prices slipped on Tuesday in a market where refiners stung by high crude premiums and poor margins began to bargain for a cheaper barrel. 
 October futures for world benchmark Brent Blend crude from the North Sea closed down 38 cents at $20.43 a barrel after failing to break through the day's high of $20.80. 
 "There was a broad feeling in the market that Brent was overheated and had to come down," a trader said. 
 On the unofficial Brent forward market, prompt differentials for Dated or physical Brent shrank, suggesting cargoes would fetch lower premiums in the weeks ahead. This could avert the risk of refineries running less crude through their systems to pump up the price of products. 
 The market was also waiting for direction from U.S. stocks data due out later on Tuesday which is forecast to show a 1.3 million barrel build in heating oil and diesel stocks in the run-up to the winter season, when gasoline gives way to heating oil as the guiding light for crude prices. 
 Low inventory builds in the United States were largely supportive of the North Sea and West African markets with 5.0 million barrels of distillate-rich North Sea grades heading trans-Atlantic in the last week alone.

 USA: Fed decides to keep interest rates steady. 
 Fed decides to keep interest rates steady. 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent 
 The (U.S.) Federal Reserve opted on Tuesday to hold interest rates steady amid signs that the economy is cooling off without inflation heating up. 
 The decision by the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee had been widely expected and left the key federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight money unchanged at 5.25 percent. 
 "The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 12:45 p.m (1645 GMT). There is no further announcement," central bank spokesman Joseph Coyne said in a brief statement. 
 The decision to hold rates steady keeps the independent Fed out of the line of political fire in the approach to the Nov. 5 presidential and congressional elections. 
 After growing at its fastest pace in two years in the second quarter, the economy looks to have slowed recently as the housing market has weakened and retail sales have stalled. 
 "It's no surprise that the Federal Reserve felt justified sitting on its hands, since there have been so many mixed signals in the economy," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at Boston-based John Hancock Financial Services. 
 Most analysts expect the economy to lose more momentum as the second half continues. But it remains an open question whether it will slow enough to keep inflation in check. 
 That means a precautionary rate rise is possible later in the year, once the Fed has more evidence to help it measure how much the expansion is slowing, economists said. 
 More than half of 30 economists surveyed by Reuters last week forecast a rate increase by the end of the year. 
 "Fed officials would prefer not to act in the last month or two before the election if they can help it," Hancock's Cheney said. But he added that he believed the next rate move could just as well be down as up. 
 Tuesday's FOMC meeting was sandwiched between the Republican Party's presidential nominating convention last week in San Diego and the Democrats' next week in Chicago. 
 A rate rise ahead of the election would not be good news for President Clinton in his drive to win a second term, although it would likely have little immediate impact on an economy that still has considerable forward momentum. 
 The economy grew at a 4.2 percent annualized pace in the second quarter -- about twice the speed most economists reckon is sustainable on a long-term basis without fanning inflation. 
 The jobs market has remained buoyant, putting extra money in workers' pockets and portending continued solid consumer spending. 
 The Fed holds its next policy-making FOMC meeting on Sept. 24. Since cutting rates by one quarter of a percentage point in January, the central bank has held monetary policy steady.

 Japan, EU may aid U.S. in ag trade reform. 
 TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. 
 
 The United States may seek an informal alliance with Japan and the European Union to win world trade rules to assure fair play by state trading enterprises, an Agriculture Department official said Tuesday. 
 A new round of world trade talks was scheduled to begin in 1999. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said earlier this summer that U.S. priorities would be elimination of unfair export subsidies and controls on so-called STEs. 
 Richard Schroeter, deputy administrator of international trade policy for the Agriculture Department, said there could be grounds for Japan and the EU to assist the U.S. drive. 
 "If we look at export subsidies, can the United States and the EU afford to eliminate or further reduce their subsidies while certain practices of other countries, which can be equivalent to export subsidies are allowed to continue?" Schroeter said at the International Sweetener Symposium. 
 "I speak here, for example, of state trading enterprises, or some producer-financed operations. My view is that there should be equivalent disciplines to avoid disadvantaging our producers." 
 So far, Japan, the EU and the United States have met market access commitments under world trade rules, he said. 
 If other nations wish to see further market-opening steps, Schroeter said, "they're going to have to take part on this issue" of state trading enterprises. 
 The U.S. view is that STEs, which often have monopoly control over imports or exports, can obstruct trade or engage in unfair sales practices. U.S. officials frequently cite the Canadian Wheat Board and Australian dairy exports in their complaints about state trading enterprises. 
 In the previous trade round, Japan's import quotas and EU farm subsidies were major U.S. targets.

 MEXICO CITY 1996-08-20
 
 Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto arrived in Mexico on Tuesday on the first leg of a five-nation, 10-day tour of Latin America. 
 Although Hashimoto made no comments to reporters upon his arrival at the Mexico City airport just before 11:30 a.m. EDT (1530 GMT), he was expected to announce credits to Mexico worth $940 million during his three-day trip, Mexican officials said. 
 Deputy Foreign Minister Juan Rebolledo Gout said on Monday that the credits -- aimed at ecological projects, small- and medium-sized firms and Mexican exporters -- would be signed by Mexican and Japanese officials on Wednesday. 
 The support comes as Hashimoto seeks to open a new trade front for Japanese industry in Latin America. Tokyo has already pumped nearly $60 billion in direct investment into the region over the past 14 years and its economic aid doubled between 1990 and 1995 to $1.14 billion. 
 Hashimoto will hold talks with President Ernesto Zedillo on Wednesday and will meet members of the Japanese-Mexican community during his stay. 
 Mexico was the first stop on a trip that will also take him to Chile, Brazil, Peru and Costa Rica. 
 A potential cloud over his trip was lifted on Monday when kidnappers released a top Japanese electronics executive in the Mexican-U.S. border city of Tijuana after a $2 million ransom was paid. 
 After nine days in captivity, Mamoru Konno, president of a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sanyo Electric Co was found in the basement of an unoccupied building after a Mexican police official contacted kidnappers with the money.

 UK: Lloyd's chief undergoes U.S. grilling. 
 Lloyd's chief undergoes U.S. grilling. 
 Christopher Adams 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Lloyd's of London chief executive Ron Sandler on Tuesday faced a three-hour grilling in a crucial United States court case, which threatens at the last minute to upset a recovery plan for the 300-year-old insurance market. 
 Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case in Virginia, where U.S. investors (Names) have applied for an injunction to stop the recovery plan in its tracks. 
 The investors, known as Names, contend that Lloyd's has contravened U.S. disclosure laws. Sandler is fighting the action personally and underwent several hours of cross-examination on Monday, said Lloyd's. 
 On Tuesday, he said the recovery plan was essential to the future of Lloyd's. Under the proposals, Lloyd's is to reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities, including pollution and asbestosis claims in the U.S., into a new company Equitas. 
 Lloyd's has for several years faced a giant raft of litigation in the U.S., but the timing of this latest challenge so near the August 28 deadline, by which Names must accept or reject the recovery plan, has caused it a serious headache. 
 Judge Robert Payne in Monday's sitting criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws. 
 The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the SEC's neutral position on this issue. Payne said the SEC would have a second opportunity to respond to his request for a ruling. 
 Early on Tuesday morning, however, Lloyd's received a boost from a separate court case in New York, which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names. They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names. 
 "We are pleased by this decision. Names entered into their commitments under UK law and we are pleased that U.S. courts continue to recognise this," said Lloyd's U.S. boss Peter Lane. 
 In Britain, meanwhile, support among Names for the recovery plan has grown since Lloyd's improved its proposals, which include a 3.2 billion pounds ($4.95 billion) offer to Names designed to offset the cost of Equitas. 
 A last ditch attempt at securing more favourable treatment by a British-based action group foundered last week, when the High Court threw out a case for judicial review of the plan. 
 But a former Name heading an action group of loss-making investors, on Tuesday hit out at Lloyd's for "breaking promises" he says were made to the hardest-hit Names. 
 The outspoken chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party and the deputy leader of the Lloyd's Defence Shield, Christopher Stockwell, ended weeks of silence with the charge Lloyd's has "reneged" on income and housing pledges. 
 Stockwell said the scheme was entirely dependent on the availability of future funds. This meant Lloyd's could end the scheme any time, which amounted to no formal commitment. 
 He also claimed fewer than 20 percent of Names have so far accepted the recovery plan. Lloyd's rejected both statements. 
 The market last week published guidelines for helping those Names who were worst off after accepting its recovery plan.

 GERMANY: German unions split on tactics in retail pay talks. 
 German unions split on tactics in retail pay talks. 
 Catherine O'Mahony 
 FRANKFURT 1996-08-20 
 
 The two main unions representing German retail workers split apart on Tuesday. The HBV union pulled out of talks in a four-month old pay dispute while the DAG opted to continue negotiations. 
 The unions have been jointly negotiating a wage and work hours deal for the 450,000 retail workers in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, one of several regional deals being hammered out in advance of November's liberalisation of shop hours. 
 However the service sector union HBV pulled out of the talks on Tuesday after employers refused to accept its unexpected demand for extra compensation for night work. 
 Until now, unions have pressed for broad adoption of a deal struck in Rhineland-Palatinate which called for workers to get a 1.85 percent wage rise plus 20 percent extra time in lieu per hour worked after 6:30 p.m. weekdays and 2:00 p.m. Saturdays. 
 The white collar DAG, which immediately distanced itself from the HBV's demands, said it was confident it could reach an agreement with shopowners on the Rhineland-Palatinate model and would continue talks. 
 Early Tuesday evening, employers and unions said the talks were progressing well. 
 The HBV, however, is insisting that shopowners pay all workers a 55 percent bonus time in lieu for time worked between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. The retail industry currently pays such bonuses only to truck drivers and store-room workers. 
 HBV negotiator Gerhard Keuchel said his union would try over the coming days to find fresh ground for new talks, but said the 55 percent bonus was essential. 
 Meanwhile the HDE retail industry association pleaded for a swift end to the deadlock on the talks, which has caused four months of sporadic strike action affecting shops and wholesalers throughout Germany. 
 "This cannot drag on until the start of November," HDE wages expert Guenther Wassmann told German radio. 
 So far, employers, hit by weak consumer spending, have baulked at accepting the Rhineland-Palatinate deal and took particular issue with the 20 percent allowance demand. 
 However in Bavaria, DAG officials said they were confident of a positive outcome from the tenth round of their wage negotiations, which begins on Wednesday. 
 The DAG suspended token strikes ahead of the talks and said it planned to suggest a compromise on the controversial 20 percent allowance. 
 However it warned that the token strikes would resume if employers declined the offer. 
 In Berlin, wage talks resumed on Tuesday morning for the region's 87,500 retail workers. Union representatives said they planned to seek an overall pay rise of five percent, to be applicable in east German states as well, in addition to the shop hours deal.

 UK: British FTSE index closes at record 3,883 points. 
 British FTSE index closes at record 3,883 points. 
 LONDON 
 
 Britain's FTSE 100 stock index, which sank to its lowest level of the year a month ago, chalked up a record closing high Tuesday, led by retail stocks. 
 "You probably couldn't have forecast a better background for the equity market than the one we've currently got," said one stock trader. "The market has a lot going for it." 
 The blue chip index closed 19.5 points higher at 3,883.2, surpassing the previous 3,872.9 record it set just last week. 
 Gainers outweighed decliners by a margin of two to one but volume was a subdued 512.9 million shares as all eyes remained fixed on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Markets Committee, which was meeting as the London market closed. 
 Retail stocks which led an early advance were boosted by the latest economic figures which showed an improvement in British consumer sentiment. 
 "The consumer credit figures this morning showed another booming month -- the consumer is back with a vengeance," another trader said. 
 But the return of the so-called "feel-good factor" in the retail sector may also reduce the likelihood of any further cuts in British interest rates, traders said.

 UK: Trocadero expects tripling of revenues. 
 Trocadero expects tripling of revenues. 
 Leslie Adler 
 LONDON 
 
 The Trocadero entertainment complex in the heart of London's Piccadilly marked its relaunch on Tuesday after a 50 million pound ($77 million) redevelopment that it said was expected to triple revenues over five years. 
 "An estimated 55 million visitors a year pass by the Trocadero and some 20 million people come through the centre," Nick Leslau, chief executive of Trocadero Plc, told a news conference. 
 The challenge, he said, was to convert visitors into money-spending consumers. 
 Leslau said he expected the retail revenues to triple over the next five years, the time span in which he expects the centre to reach maturity. 
 He said Trocadero would seek to convert rental agreements into revenue-sharing deals as leases expire. 
 Trocadero and Japan's Sega together invested about $77 million in redesigning the centre -- shifting its focus from shopping to entertainment and giving it a flashy, high-tech look -- and installing a SegaWorld virtual reality centre due to open next month. 
 An Imax 3D cinema is to open in early 1997. 
 The complex's current entertainment and shopping tenants -- including cinemas, an amusement arcade and a Planet Hollywood restaurant as well as shops -- generate retail revenues of about 125 million pounds ($192 million) a year, Leslau said. Trocadero derives its revenues from the rental income it receives from these tenants. 
 It recently entered into a joint venture for a Marvel Mania themed restaurant to be built adjacent to the Trocadero. The Marvel Mania restaurant, based on characters from Marvel comics, is a joint venture with Robert Earl's Planet Hollywood and Ronald Perelman's Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. 
 Trocadero's current rental deals provide guaranteed income that is sufficient to cover the complex's service debt and overhead for the next 22 years, Leslau said. 
 Trocadero Plc was spun off from property management group Burford Holdings last November. Burford had acquired the Trocadero complex in September 1994 for 94 million pounds ($145 million). At that time the Trocadero was a shopping mall. 
 "The key to success at the Trocadero lay in its transformation from a shopping mall into a premier entertainment destination," Leslau added.

 GERMANY: Viag stays positive after first half profit slump. 
 Viag stays positive after first half profit slump. 
 Catherine O'Mahony 
 FRANKFURT 1996-08-20 
 
 German utility group Viag AG on Tuesday said its net profit this year ought to at least match 1995's 1.32 billion marks ($886.1 million) despite a 21 percent slide in its earnings in first-half 1996. 
 The diversified group said its pre-tax profit slumped to 1.178 billion marks in the first six months of 1996, but chairman Georg Obermeier stressed that the comparative 1995 figure was swollen by one-off gains from selling off units. 
 Speaking to a news conference, Obermeier said operating profit had risen 10 percent in the six-month period, but declined to give absolute figures. 
 He also noted that the bulk of Viag's first-half profit in 1995 was the result of one-off gains from the sale of its 43.4 percent stake in Germany's biggest paper maker PWA and the final consolidaton of its SKW Trostberg unit. 
 "Overall the Viag group is developing in line with ... expectations. The economic weakness of the winter period had an effect on the cyclical divisions, however growth tendencies are evident again in several areas," Viag said. 
 Viag also said its group sales expanded by two percent to 21.803 billion marks from 21.375 billion in the first half of 1996. 
 The group said sales growth was varied across different divisions, with strong gains in its energy units, in its SKW unit's natural fibres division, drinks packaging at its Schmalbach-Lubeca unit and at Computer 2000. 
 However turnover in aluminium business at its VAW unit and steel trading at its Kloeckner unit had come under strong pressure, Viag said. 
 Overall packaging sales dropped to 5.9 billion marks from 6.3 billion marks, while the other core business segments -- energy, chemicals and logistics -- posted sales growth. 
 Viag said it would continue to expand its core business areas and proceed with a range of restructuring and cost-cutting measures. 
 Group investment in fixed assets dropped to 792 million marks from 913 million marks in the first half of 1996 while group spending on participations dropped dramatically to 178 million marks from 1.49 billion. 
 In the first half of 1995, Viag and its units bought several major companies including SBI Systems Bio-Industries, bought by Viag's chemicals division and a majority stake in Computer 2000. 
 Viag's workforce was little changed at 82,874 compared with 84,939 in the first six months of 1995.

 GERMANY: Rangebound German shares end mixed, utilities up. 
 Rangebound German shares end mixed, utilities up. 
 FRANKFURT 1996-08-20 
 
 German shares were rangebound in bourse trade on Tuesday, with the highlight of the day a shifting of interest from the chemical sector into utility stocks. 
 The 30-share DAX ended the day down 2.50 points at 2,560.26 points after sticking in a seven-point range. The IBIS-DAX, tracking electronic trading during the day, closed slightly better at 2,562.12 points. 
 The big three chemical groups took the biggest battering, while utility shares benefited from interest partly generated by Viag AG's forthcoming six month earnings report. After the close of the electronic bourse trading Viag reported operating profit up 10 percent during the first half of this year. 
 The broader market was lacklustre, dealers said, and shrugged off a Bundesbank report showing slower July M3 growth, which is viewed as boosting the case for the central bank to cut the securities repurchase rate, or repo, on Thursday. 
 Chemicals were sold to make way for utilities. In IBIS trading Hoechst lost 31 pfennigs to 50.80 marks, Bayer declined by 5 pfennigs to 52.35 marks while utility Viag rose 6.75 to 569.75. 
 Utilities have been underperforming during the last two months, but are bottoming out now, traders said. 
 "The upswing in utilities stocks is an answer to the recent weakness of those shares", one dealer said. 
 Dealers said the moderate M3 growth was in line with expectations and thus failed to generate momentum for the stock market. 
 However the market will continue to look for guidance on the interest rate front ahead of the Bundesbank meeting Thursday, dealers said. 
 The result of the FOMC meeting in the U.S. due early in the European evening was expected to provide further clues.

 Fleet, NatWest form pact. 
 BOSTON 
 
 Fleet Financial Group and National Westminster Bank PLC said Tuesday they signed an agreement that will allow both companies to provide banking services to corporate customers in Britain and the United States. 
 Under the agreement, NatWest will set up a representative office in Boston to provide Sterling and foreign currency account and cash management services to American companies that either have a physical presence in Britain or trade there. 
 Desks also will be created in Boston, New York and London, where each bank's customers can receive quick help in opening accounts and cash management. The offices will be staffed by employees who will bring specific expertise in their country's banking system to each marketplace, the companies said. 
 Fleet will provide U.S. dollar accounts and cash management services to the U.S. subsidiaries and offices of British-based companies. Fleet currently markets U.S. cash management services directly to British companies from its office in London. 
 NatWest supplies commercial banking services to about one-third of the companies in Britain and is the second largest retail bank in the country with over 2,000 branches.

 UK: Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher. 
 Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Silver prices were at their highest levels since mid-June on Tuesday after speculative buying sent the New York market surging overnight, dealers said. 
 Gold followed only reluctantly, but market analysts said it could eventually make a go of breaking through its recent price ceiling at just under $390 an ounce. 
 Silver closed at $5.23 an ounce, up eleven cents from Monday's London close. It fixed at just over $5.20 an ounce, the highest fixing since June 19. 
 Silver eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight. 
 But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week. "It's a purely technical move, but I can see it going for $5.30 this week," one said. 
 Technical analysts or chartists who follow detailed charts of past prices said that the rally needed to clear the $5.25 resistance level before pushing higher. 
 Silver have been trending lower since peaking at a fix of around $5.83 in early February. 
 "Silver is not out of the woods yet," said analyst Cliff Green of Trend Analysis. "But getting up past that $5.15-45.16 area is a positive step." 
 In contrast, bullion closed just $0.90 higher at $387.55 an ounce, virtually ignoring silver's newfound strength. 
 "Gold has had a bit of a dismal performance. The move seems to be just in silver," one dealer said. 
 But some chartists said gold has scope to move higher. 
 "Obviously much depends on gold's ability to clear the critical resistance immediately below $390," said analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge. 
 "But silver's recovery following what is looking to be a false breakdown earlier below $5.00 adds to the evidence this may occur," she added. 
 Some analysts said gold was being cautious while waiting for the outcome of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in New York in case of surprises on interest rates. 
 Another dampener was a slump in the South African rand, which was seen encouraging selling by South African producers. 
 Palladium closed at $125.60, up $0.95 and off recent 2-1/2 year lows, while platinum ended $1.40 higher at $399.80.

 JAPAN: Mazda's new ad campaign sports unlikely celebrity. 
 Mazda's new ad campaign sports unlikely celebrity. 
 TOKYO 
 
 Mazda Motor Corp. is using a foreign celebrity -- its own president -- to revamp its image in Japan. 
 Company President Henry Wallace, a famous figure in Japan as the first foreigner to head a major Japanese firm, is to star in Mazda's new advertising campaign. 
 The 50-year-old Wallace will appear in full-page advertisments in five major Japanese newspapers Thursday. 
 Mazda broke with tradition by putting a foreigner in the driver's seat and is doing so again with its new sales promotion. It is rare for a Japanese company to use photos of its top management in a campaign to sell its merchandise. 
 The ads will have a full picture of Wallace standing to the left and his comments about the company on the right. 
 Wallace has become a celebrity in Japan after being appointed president at Mazda, Japan's fifth-largest carmaker, in June. 
 Sent over by Ford Motor Co. several years ago to help turn around the troubled Japanese automaker, Wallace was given the top spot when Ford increased its equity stake in the company to about one-third. 
 Wallace comes originally from Edinburgh, Scotland, and has been employed by Ford for 25 years. He first joined Ford's British operation. 
 Mazda decided to use Wallace in its ads as the result of a survey showing that Japanese found him likeable and impressive, the spokesman said. 
 The company has been struggling with poor demand for most of its cars and has been in the red on a group net basis for the past three years. The losses were the result of a number of errors in assessing the market, analysts say. 
 Mazda is hoping a straight-forward approach in its ad will distinguish it from its rivals and capture the attention of consumers. 
 The ads displaying Wallace will carry the slogan "Practical car, Enjoyable car, That's Mazda." 
 The ad will be promoting its new compact recreational vehicle, the Demio, which will debut in Japan next week. Compact recreational vehicles are one of the hottest selling models for all Japanese automakers. 
 Mazda has had a relationship with Ford for many years. In May, Ford raised its stake in Mazda to 33.4 percent from 25 percent -- which gave it control of the management. 
 Ford sent Wallace to Japan to represent its interests in Mazda two years ago. 
 "If successful, Wallace may continue appearing in Mazda's future ads," the company spokesman said.

 UK: British money growth slows, back in monitoring range. 
 British money growth slows, back in monitoring range. 
 LONDON 
 
 Growth in Britain's M4 money supply slowed to 8.8 percent in the first half of the year, the Bank of England said Tuesday, while lending by banks and building societies continued to increase. 
 The slowdown in money supply growth from annual rates of 10 percent in May and June brought the figure back within the government's monitoring range of 3 percent to 9 percent for the first time since November. 
 Some economists said it could suggest a softening in future inflationary pressures. 
 However, the British Bankers' Association said a strong 539 million pound ($833 million) increase in consumer credit in July could point to a strengthening of consumer spending. 
 "The strength of consumer credit and housing market activity within the lending figures will be seized upon by the Bank of England as a potential threat to the inflation target," said Andrew Cates, an economist at UBS. 
 Seasonally adjusted M4 -- a broad measure of money supply which comprises cash in circulation, personal and commercial bank deposits and certificates of deposit -- grew 0.4 percent in July from June, down from 0.7 percent in June. 
 Strong money supply growth is often seen as a pointer to future inflation and central bank Governor Eddie George has warned that interest rates might have to rise if it continued unchecked. 
 However, its reliability has been thrown into question this year because of special distorting factors, such as a rash of corporate mergers and acquisitions. 
 The slowdown will, therefore, offer little new ammunition to Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Kenneth Clarke if he wants to cut interest rates this fall. 
 Clarke has cut rates four times since last December to their current 5.75 percent level, overruling the Bank of England on the last occasion in June.

 JAPAN: Japan adds game machines to inflation gauge. 
 Japan adds game machines to inflation gauge. 
 TOKYO 
 
 Japan said Tuesday that game machines, tickets to soccer matches and imported rice will replace traditional socks worn with the kimono and corned beef as items used to measure the nation's price movements. 
 New items also include golf fees and delivered pizza. 
 In a move underlining changes in consumer tastes, the government announced it was revising the selection of goods it uses to track price trends to include more up-to-date items. 
 "We are adding 37 items to a basket of goods purchased by households to better measure recent price moves," said an official of the government's Management and Coordination Agency. 
 The agency updates the components and changes the base year for Japan's consumer price index every five years. 
 The new CPI will cover 580 items after dropping goods like harmonicas, which Japanese children learn to play in school, and a pressed-fish sausage eaten as a snack. 
 With many consumer items now sold at discount stores in recent years, analysts question if the new basket can still detect price movements accurately. 
 "It is very important to see whether they will put a greater weighting on discount stores in their analysis," said Russell Jones, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. 
 "We are not ignoring prices at discount stores, but we cannot say how many items sold discounted are analysed," the agency official said. 
 The agency said prices have almost stopped dropping after several years of decline during the prolonged recession that followed the collapse of the 1980s "bubble" economy. 
 CPI figures are issued every month.

 Orange telecom group loss grows but says future bright. 
 LONDON 
 
 British mobile telephone group Orange Plc said Tuesday its pre-tax losses expanded by 40 percent to 125.2 million pounds ($193.6 million) in the first half of the year, although its subscriber base and revenues both grew. 
 Orange, whose shares have fallen well below the level at which they were offered to the public in March, said the loss was expected and pointed to steady gains in its subscribers and revenue as proof of the underlying health of the business. 
 "Our net growth has increased dramatically ... All the key drivers of the business, we are succeeding on," Managing Director Hans Snook said in an interview. 
 Shares in Orange gained 4 pence (6.2 cents) to 191 ($2.95) after the results, which compared with a loss of 88.8 million ($137.3 million) a year earlier. 
 But the stock is still well short of the 205 pence ($3.17) level of its flotation, which valued the group at some 2.5 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) and propelled it into the FTSE-100 index of leading British shares. 
 Orange said its revenue more than doubled to 256.5 million pounds ($396.7 million) from 100 million pounds (154.7 million) as it added a further 194,000 subscribers to take its total customer base to 573,000.

 Thistle Hotels almost doubles profits. 
 LONDON 
 
 Thistle Hotels, Britain's second biggest hotel chain, said Tuesday its pre-tax profits almost doubled in the first half of the year. 
 The company, which plans an initial public offering of stock in September, said its net income, excluding exceptional items, expanded to 24.1 million pounds ($37.2 million). 
 However, profits were hit by a one-time charge of 87.8 million pounds ($135.5 million) to partly account for a 10 percent cut in the valuation of its hotel portfolio to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.6 billion). 
 Thistle owns some 100 hotels, including such luxury names as London's Grosvenor and Royal Horseguards hotels. 
 Market watchers say its initial public offering could value the group at between one billion and 1.5 billion pounds ($1.5 billion and $2.3 billion). 
 Thistle plans to raise 250 million pounds ($386 million) in cash through the offer. About 100 million to 150 million pounds ($155 to $232 million) would be used to reduce debt, with the remaining being invested in expanding room capacity, Chief Executive Robert Peel said. 
 "We would focus the money on London -- the region where we get the best returns," he said in an interview. 
 Thistle said a price range would be announced at the time of the stock offering, which has no fixed date so far.

 GERMANY: Fresh talks on German retail pay dispute falter. 
 Fresh talks on German retail pay dispute falter.

 FRANKFURT 1996-08-20 
 
 Talks between German retail workers' unions and shopowners aimed at resolving a four-month old pay dispute hit a further stumbling block on Tuesday, despite union optimism that a settlement could be reached. 
 Ulrich Walter, chief negotiator for shopowners in North Rhine-Westphalia, said an unexpected union demand for night-time bonuses for the region's 450,000 retail workers had made agreement impossible in Tuesday's talks. 
 Unions and employers in several federal states are resuming talks this week to agree a wage and work hours deal to cope with the liberalisation of German shopping hours in November. 
 Until now, unions have pressed for broad adoption of a deal struck in Rhineland-Palatinate which called for workers to get a 1.85 percent wage rise plus 20 percent extra time in lieu per hour worked after 6:30 p.m. weekdays and 2:00 p.m. Saturdays. 
 However the HBV services union on Tuesday called for a 55 percent bonus time in lieu for shifts between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. The retail industry currently pays such bonuses only to truck drivers and store-room workers. 
 The white-collar DAG union distanced itself from the demand. 
 Earlier HBV's chief negotiator for North Rhine-Westphalia, Gerhard Keuchel, said there were "strong chances" for agreement during Tuesday's talks, which took place in the town of Marl. 
 The HDE retail industry association also pleaded for a swift end to the deadlock on the talks, which has caused four months of sporadic strike action affecting shops and wholesalers throughout Germany. 
 "This cannot drag on until the start of November," HDE wages expert Guenther Wassmann told German radio.

 Halifax Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender, reported half-year profits of 649 million pounds ($1 billion) Tuesday. 
 However, the society said its share of Britain's reviving housing market slipped to a 7.2 percent share of net mortage lending and 15.2 percent of gross mortgage lending. 
 Spokesman Gary Marsh said in an interview that these levels were below the firm's normal market share of about 20 percent because it had shied away from re-mortgaging, which accounted for 30 percent of the total mortgage market. 
 The size of the re-mortgage market reflects the low level of transactions from home buyers, Marsh said. 
 One analyst said the slip reflected the society's pursuit of profits as it prepared for a public stock offering.

 UK: Lloyd's braces for crucial U.S. court case ruling. 
 Lloyd's braces for crucial U.S. court case ruling. 
 Christopher Adams 
 LONDON 
 
 Lloyd's of London Tuesday braced for a possible ruling in a crucial United States court case that threatens at the last minute to upset a recovery plan for the 300-year-old insurance market. 
 Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case in Richmond, Va., where U.S. investors, known as Names, have applied for an injunction to block the recovery plan. 
 Under its rescue proposals, Lloyd's is to reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities, including pollution and asbestos-related claims in the United States, into a new company called Equitas. 
 Names have only eight days left in which to accept or reject this plan, on which the future of the market hangs. 
 Since improving the terms of the proposals, which include a 3.2 billion pound ($4.95 billion) offer to Names designed to offset the cost of Equitas, support among British Names for the plan has grown. 
 A last-ditch attempt at securing more favourable treatment by a British-based action group floundered last week when the High Court threw out a case for judicial review of the plan. 
 But in the United States, Lloyd's has for several years faced a raft of litigation. This latest challenge by 100 American Names contends that Lloyd's has breached U.S. disclosure laws. 
 The insurance market's chief executive, Ron Sandler, is fighting the action personally. He was cross-examined Monday. 
 Judge Robert Payne criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws. 
 The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the SEC's neutral position on this issue. Payne said the SEC would have a second opportunity to respond to his request for a ruling. 
 Early Tuesday morning, however, Lloyd's received a boost from a separate court case in New York, which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names. They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names. 
 "We are pleased by this decision. Names entered into their commitments under UK law and we are pleased that U.S. courts continue to recognise this," said Lloyd's U.S. boss Peter Lane. 
 The market last week published guidelines for helping those Names who were worst off after accepting its recovery plan.

 U.S. farm trade surplus $1.741 billion in June. 
 WASHINGTON 
 
 The U.S. trade surplus in agricultural commodities was $1.741 billion in June, down from a revised $1.879 billion in May, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. 
 In its monthly trade report, Commerce pegged farm exports at $4.276 billion in June, down from $4.723 billion in May. Imports were $2.535 billion, compared with $2.844 billion the previous month. 
 The cumulative surplus in farm trade was $13.667 billion in the first six months of the year, compared with $11.400 billion in the same period last year. 
 In June, the value of U.S. corn exports fell to $640 million from $885 million in May, and wheat exports fell to $448 million from $475 million. Soybean exports rose to $430 million from $352 million, the department said. 
 Imports of vegetable oils and fats fell in June to $110 million from $157 million in May.

 USA: Fed seen holding U.S. interest rates steady. 
 Fed seen holding U.S. interest rates steady. 
 Caren Bohan 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 The U.S. Federal Reserve met on Tuesday to discuss the future course of interest rates and was widely expected to keep rates steady amid mixed signals on the economy. 
 "The speeches made by various Fed governors and by bank presidents recently are not pointing toward tightening," said Preston Martin, chairman of HomeVest Financial Services Inc. in San Francisco. 
 "I would think the odds are very heavily weighted toward the prospect that there will be no change at the next policy-making meeting," said Martin, a former Fed vice chairman. 
 The central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) started meeting at 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT). If past practice is followed, any decision should be announced around 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT). 
 Martin's forecast was shared unanimously by the 30 economists polled last week by Reuters, although some of those experts did not rule out a rate rise later this year. 
 Financial markets marked time Tuesday morning as they awaited the outcome of the central bank meeting, with bond and stock prices little changed. 
 The Fed meeting takes place at a time when questions abound about whether the economy is beginning to cool off after growing at a fast clip in the second quarter. 
 Until just a few weeks ago, many economists believed the economy was growing quickly enough to require an interest-rate rise by the Fed to slow it down and prevent inflation. However, a series of recent reports containing early signs of a slowdown changed those views. 
 The latest came on Tuesday, with news that the U.S. trade deficit fell by more than 20 percent in June as imports plunged. Analysts said the steep drop in imports pointed to slackening domestic demand and a slowing U.S. economy. 
 "We had data very recently showing the housing market is starting to fade and the inflation reports were good," said Joel Prakken, chairman at the St. Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisors LLC. 
 "All of that suggests we are seeing a slowdown from the second quarter and that the Fed does not need to move," he added. 
 Some experts, however, said the economic signs were inconclusive and did not rule out a rate rise later this year. 
 Any rate increase would represent a reversal in the Fed's monetary policy. The previous rate change was in January, the last of a series of credit easings undertaken when the economy appeared soft. The economy has rebounded strongly since then. 
 The federal funds rate, which commercial banks charge each other for overnight cash, is now at 5.25 percent. The funds rate is controlled by the Fed and acts as a benchmark for other short-term interest rates. 
 The discount rate, which the Fed charges member banks for loans, stands at 5 percent.

 AUSTRALIA: Australian dollar, bonds retreat from budget. 
 Australian dollar, bonds retreat from budget. 
 Colin Brinsden 
 SYDNEY 1996-08-20 
 
 The Australian dollar and bonds both went into quick retreat on Tuesday amid mild disappointment that the maiden budget of Australia's conservative government was not as tough as the markets had been led to believe. 
 Within an hour of the budget being announced on Tuesday night the dollar had sunk to US$0.7860/0.7865 from a pre-budget US$0.7883/88, while long dated bond yields rose some eight basis points taking the November 2006 bond back up to 8.0 percent. 
 "It wasn't a complete disappointment, but this is the first of supposedly extremely tough budgets and it doesn't quite live up to expectations," said UBS chief economist Stephen Roberts. 
 The treasurer announced an underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion (US$4.46 billion) and a headline budget surplus of A$474 million for 1996/97 after savings of A$3.9 billion. 
 Median forecasts had centred on an underlying deficit of A$4.9 billion and a headline surplus of A$1.0 billion. 
 A total borrowing requirement of A$7.0 billion for 1996/97 was also larger than some analysts had expected. 
 The local bond market had rallied strongly in recent days in anticipation of a fiscal squeeze in the first conservative government budget in 14 years. It had been looking for cuts of over A$4.0 billion to maintain the momentum that had taken yields to their lowest level since March 1994. 
 The local dollar also lost its gloss after advancing to a three-week high of US$0.7933 at the start of the day amid repeated comments by the five-month-old government that the budget would pave the way for further cuts in interest rates. 
 "If we can get our budget, intact, through the Senate, if we can get that low inflation locked in, then I think we can set up the chances for an easing in monetary policy," Costello said. 
 The dollar had slid to US$0.7700 after last month's surprise 50 basis points cut in official interest rates to 7.0 percent as it eroded the currency's yield advantage, and there are fears that a further reduction could see it fall to US$0.7600. 
 "The next hurdle is going to be the passage of the budget through the Senate," said Bruce Freeland, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. "Difficulties in passing the budget have previously led to downward pressure on the Australian dollar and higher bond yields." 
 However, he added that recent statements by the minor parties in the Senate would seem to reduce the probability of the budget being blocked in the upper house. 
 The budget also painted a rosy outlook for the economy with growth forecast to average 3.5 percent over 1996/97 and underlying inflation at 2.75 percent. 
 "It is probably mildly bearish for the markets because it was such a favourable economic outlook, rather than any failure on the fiscal tightening...," said Stephen Koukoulas, senior economist at Citibank Australia. (A$1 = US$0.79)

 GERMANY: Wella first-half profits up sharply. 
 Wella first-half profits up sharply. 
 DARMSTADT, Germany 
 
 Wella AG, the German haircare group, Tuesday reported healthy growth in sales and earnings in the first six months as new product launches helped it outperform the rest of the industry. 
 Operating profit rose 25 percent to 61 million marks ($40.95 million), while sales expanded 11.3 percent to 1.82 billion marks ($1.22 billion), the company said in its interim report. 
 It predicted full-year sales would rise by 7-10 percent and said earnings growth was likely to be stronger. 
 "We are anticipating a continuation of the positive business development in the second half of 1996," Wella said. 
 But the news failed to give buoyancy to Wella's shares. The ordinary shares closed down nine marks ($6) or 1 percent at 888 marks ($596.17). Preference shares closed little changed at 900 marks ($604.23), down 0.10 marks (6.7 cents), after recovering from a day's low of 885 ($594.16). 
 Pre-tax profit fell to 61 million marks ($41 million) from 83 million marks ($55.7 million) in the year-earlier period, when Wella had a one-time gain of 35 million marks ($23.5 million) from the dissolution of provisions no longer required. 
 The first-half operating earnings growth marks a turnaround from 1995 when net profit slumped 41 percent to 74.2 million marks ($49.8 million) amid adverse currency movements and operational problems. 
 Wella in April predicted net profit would rebound 25 percent in 1995. 
 The sales rise of 11.3 percent outstripped market growth of less than 3 percent, Wella said. Wella also said it achieved an increase of 7.9 percent in sales to hairdressers despite a stagnating hairdressing market. 
 Sales of haircare products to retailers jumped 21.3 percent, well above expectations, Wella said. "Our new product concepts have been very well received worldwide," it said. 
 Sales of scents and cosmetics rose 12.4 percent in the first half due to successful product launches. 
 Domestic sales were 574 million marks ($385.4 million) versus 533 million ($357.8 million), while sales abroad rose to 1.24 billion marks ($832.5 million) from 1.1 billion ($738.5 million). 
 A Wella spokesman said the improvement in the first six months was due in part to Wella's foreign subsidiaries which managed to recover from losses posted last year in China, Russia and Britain. 
 German subsidiaries like Muelhens, the maker of the 4711 Eau de Cologne, improved sharply while Wella's core domestic business did not perform as well, the spokesman said. 
 That is reflected in figures for the parent company which reported its sales trimmed by 5.3 percent to 415 million marks ($278.6 million) while pre-tax profit was unchanged at 33 million marks ($22.2 million).

 USA: U.S. June trade gap narrows sharply as imports drop. 
 U.S. June trade gap narrows sharply as imports drop. 
 Glenn Somerville 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 The U.S. trade gap narrowed dramatically in June as imports of merchandise and petroleum plunged from May levels, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. 
 The monthly deficit dropped 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion from a revised $10.55 billion in May -- much lower than the $9.4 billion shortfall that Wall Street economists had forecast for June. 
 June exports eased a slight 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion while imports dropped 3.3 percent to $77.82 billion. 
 Amid the big overall improvement in June trade, China emerged for the first time as the nation with which the United States has the largest bilateral shortfall. 
 The deficit with China climbed 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion in June, surpassing the $3.24 billion deficit with Japan that was up 3.6 percent from May. 
 Commerce noted that exports of American-made goods to China declined for a fourth straight month in June, which is likely to fuel trade tensions between the two countries. 
 Steady improvement in shrinking the deficit with Japan was the main reason that China became the leading deficit nation in June, Commerce officials said. The second-quarter deficit of $10.5 billion with Japan was the smallest quarterly deficit in five years, the department said. 
 Previously, the department said the overall May trade deficit was $10.88 billion but it revised that down to a $10.55 billion gap. 
 The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits. 
 In June, the merchandise deficit fell 13.9 percent to $14.46 billion from $16.79 billion in May. Lower imports of new cars and parts, especially from Japan and Germany, helped shrink the merchandise trade gap. 
 The surplus on services climbed 1.6 percent to $6.34 billion from $6.25 billion in May. Analysts said beforehand that an influx of tourists bound for the Olympic Games in Atlanta would boost the services surplus. 
 The cost and volume of all types of petroleum products fell in June after a sharp May runup. The cost of petroleum imports declined to $5.33 billion in June from $5.93 billion while the volume fell to 291,866 barrels from 305,171 in May. 
 Foreign sales of civilian aircraft declined in June by $117 million to $1.54 billion. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were off $138 million to $12.32 billion. 
 Imports of autos and parts from all sources dropped sharply by $689 million to $10.79 billion in June. Computer imports were down $413 million to $4.24 billion and semiconductor imports decreased $291 million to $2.87 billion in June. 
 In bilateral trade, the deficit with Western Europe fell 7.1 percent to $761 million and the shortfall with Canada was down 2.2 percent to $2.42 billion. 
 In trade with Mexico, the U.S. deficit shrank 6.4 percent to $1.49 billion amid signs the Mexican economy was recovering from a deep recession and grew solidly in the second quarter this year. 
 The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May.

 TAIWAN: Taiwan cautious on China direct shipping rules. 
 Taiwan cautious on China direct shipping rules. 
 Alice Hung 
 TAIPEI 1996-08-20 
 
 Taipei gave a positive but cautious response to China's release on Tuesday of rules governing direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait, even though such links are still banned by Taiwan. 
 "Of course we are happy to see it accomplished, but would prefer to comment after we have more details," said an official with the island's Ministry of Transportation and Communications. 
 The island's top agency for China policymaking, the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, gave a cooler response, saying Beijing's rules were belated and "mingled with sensitive political issues". 
 The regulations, effective from Tuesday, allow only wholly Chinese-owned or Taiwan-owned shipping companies or joint ventures involving Chinese or Taiwanese shipowners to sail between the two sides, Beijing's Xinhua news agency said. 
 "The regulations...are meant to promote cargo and passenger transport between the two sides of the Straits and accelerate the development of direct mail service, trade, and air and shipping links across the Straits," Xinhua said. 
 Hong Kong's Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po daily said China's southeastern ports at Xiamen and Fuzhou would be the first to be opened to direct shipping links with Taiwan. 
 "The conditions for (establishing) direct shipping links are ripe," the newspaper said. 
 Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council urged Beijing to be practical and remove barriers that have prevented direct links. 
 "...The mainland's direct links plan is still mingled with sensitive political issues," it said. "We hope the mainland side can adopt a practical attitude to remove obstacles blocking links across the strait." It did not elaborate. 
 Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the civil war to the Chinese communists and fled to the island in 1949. 
 China views Taiwan as a renegade province. 
 With tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in Hong Kong, Macau or other third countries. 
 To fulfil its ambition of becoming an Asia-Pacific business hub, Taiwan proposed in 1995 to set up an offshore transshipment centre at southern Kaohsiung port from which ships would be allowed to sail directly between Taiwan and China. 
 The project has been delayed by sovereignty issues, with squabbling over Chinese and Taiwanese flags and documents that would bear the names and marks from both governments and might be interpreted by either side as reciprocal recognition. 
 "It (Beijing's plan) is similar to our offshore transshipment centre plan," transport ministry spokesman Hsu Chieh-kuei said on state television. 
 "It will be good if we can find a way to resolve the sea links problem across the Taiwan Strait," Hsu said. "We will carefully study the counterproposals." 
 Taiwan investors, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, have pressured the government to establish such links to save transportation costs. 
 "This is a breakthrough," Taiwan global shipping giant Evergreen Marine Corp said in a statement. "The company welcomes the decision from the business point of view."

 UK: FOCUS-BSkyB profits surge 66 percent. 
 FOCUS-BSkyB profits surge 66 percent. 
 Keith Weir 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Satellite broadcaster BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay television, on Tuesday reported a 66 percent rise in full-year profit to 257.4 million pounds ($398.1 million). 
 Annual turnover climbed to more than one billion pounds as the number of subscribers in Britain and Ireland rose to 5.5 million for BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake. 
 Profit for the year to June 30, 1996 -- up more than 100 million pounds on the 155.3 million reported a year ago -- was towards the top end of analysts' forecasts. The full-year dividend of 5.5 pence was lower than expected, however. 
 BSkyB shares shed seven pence to 530p in early trading, having climbed to record highs in recent days. 
 "The continuing growth in subscribers, the increase in the number of channels and the renewal of the Premier League (soccer) contract until 2001 provide a firm base from which to pioneer the development of digital television in the UK," chief executive Sam Chisholm said in a statement. 
 "The agreement with Kirch Gruppe to develop the digital platform in Germany gives us a great opportunity to extend our business into continental Europe," he said. 
 BSkyB plans to launch a British digital television service next year. 
 Last month it signed a deal with the group headed by Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch under which it will take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1, Kirch's digital pay television operation. 
 BSkyB is expected to inject 200 million pounds into the alliance to cover start-up losses over the next three years. The deal gives BSkyB access to Europe's largest television market. 
 BSkyB said spending on programming rose by 28 percent to 420 million pounds after the purchase of golf, boxing and cricket events and the launch of new channels such as Disney. 
 The programming spend is set to rise further following a 670 million pound deal signed in June which will enable BSkyB to retain rights to broadcast live English Premier League soccer for the next five years. 
 One cloud on the horizon is a report that British cable companies may seek European Commission intervention over the fees BSkyB charges for its top channels. 
 The Financial Times said the cable companies fear they will not secure satisfactory conditions despite BSkyB undertakings to revise the structure of its wholesale rate card.

 AUSTRALIA: Aborigines burn flag in Canberra budget protests. 
 Aborigines burn flag in Canberra budget protests. 
 Terry Friel 
 CANBERRA 1996-08-20 
 
 Aborigines burnt an Australian flag during an anti-budget rally in front of parliament house on Tuesday and clashed with police as Treasurer Peter Costello assured Australians his first budget at 0930 GMT would be fair. 
 Hundreds of other Aborigines staged rallies in Brisbane and Adelaide against already announced cuts to indigenous funding in the 1996/97 budget. 
 "Everyone, if you want to come and stamp on the white law, and the white flag, stamp on the ashes like they stamped on ours," said an Aborigine as the Australian flag burned. 
 The aboriginal protest, which attracted about 1,000 people, was rowdy, with chanting, didgeridoo playing and rhythm sticks. At one stage Aborigines tried to enter the nearby old parliament house, but were repelled by police in riot gear. 
 About 150 Aborigines attacked police with bricks, bottles and stakes during a 20-minute confrontation at the old parliament house. One policewoman was repeatedly kicked and has been taken to hospital in a serious condition, a police spokeswoman said. 
 On Monday, an anti-government rally of 15,000 unionists, Aborigines, students and welfare groups in front of Canberra's parliament ended in a riot, as hundreds of protesters stormed into the parliament's foyer. 
 Police wearing riot gear took two hours to control the riot. 
 "All we want is justice in our own country," aboriginal activist Charles Perkins told Tuesday's rally. 
 "We don't want budget cuts -- it's hard enough as it is," said Perkins, standing in front of a map of Australia painted with the aboriginal flag and the words: "Sovereignty never ceded". "The money that Australia has comes from aboriginal land. Give us a fair go," he said. 
 Aborigines, the most disadvantaged group in Australian society, have labelled "racist" A$400 million (US$312 million) in indigenous spending cuts over the next four years. 
 Deputy chair of the peak Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Ray Robinson, told Tuesday's rally that reconciliation between white and black Australia was dead. 
 "Forget about reconciliation that's finished," he said. 
 "They say we must continue on with the reconciliation. Do you stab someone in the guts with a knife and while they are dying, say we want to be friends? It doesn't happen that way." 
 The five-month-old Liberal-National government was to announce its budget to June 30, 1997 at 0930 GMT. The budget will be its first and the first for a conservative Australian government in 14 years. 
 "It's going to be a fair budget, and we are looking forward to putting in place the measures that will help families and small businesses and get Australia moving," treasurer Costello told reporters on Tuesday morning. 
 The government has promised to cut A$4.0 billion from its maiden budget in a tough fiscal programme aimed at achieving a budget surplus within three years. The budget deficit for 1995/96 was A$10.3 billion. 
 Financial markets are concerned about Australia's chronic national savings and external debt problems and are counting on Costello slashing the budget deficit, hopefully by more than the forecast A$4.0 billion.

 AUSTRALIA: Australian Alan Bond sentenced to three years jail. 
 Australian Alan Bond sentenced to three years jail. 
 PERTH, Australia 1996-08-20 
 
 Failed Australian businessman Alan Bond was sentenced to three years in jail on Tuesday for fraud involving the French impressionist painting, La Promenade. 
 In sentencing Bond, Western Australia District Court Judge Antoinette Kennedy said that while the jail term was not the maximum 14 years she could impose, it would seem like a "life sentence" to Bond. 
 Bond, 58, who became a national hero in 1983 for backing Australia's capture of the America's Cup yachting trophy, had appealed for a non-custodial sentence. His lawyer argued that a jail term could kill him because of his failing health. 
 But Kennedy said she was satisfied that Bond's "health problems could be monitored within the prison system". Bond said he suffers from blood pressure and heart problems. 
 "The sentence I intend to impose on you, you will not regard as lenient, but many in the community will," Kennedy said. "When I speak of the community I do not speak of the vicious and the hate-filled -- they are insatiable -- but reasonable members of the community. 
 "Such people must understand that time in prison goes a lot slower than time outside ... and that any prison sentence is a life sentence in a sense for someone in your position, in that you can not sink into anonymity, but it will follow you for ever." 
 Last Friday, Bond was found guilty of improperly using his position as director of his former corporate flagship, Bond Corporation Holdings, to allow his private company to buy Edouard Manet's La Promenade from Bond Corp for A$2.5 million (US$1.9 million), when its value was at least A$12 million. 
 Bond's Dallhold Investments Pty Ltd sold the painting a year later at auction in New York for A$17 million. 
 The Australian Securities Commission, the nation's corporate watchdog, brought four fraud charges against Bond for his 1988 actions. 
 Kennedy said Bond's passion for art and his inability to accept that Bond Corp was not longer his "fiefdom" combined to encourage him to commit the fraud offences. 
 Bond's lawyers said he would appeal the conviction.

 UK: British FTSE index closes at record 3,883 points. 
 British FTSE index closes at record 3,883 points. 
 Elaine Hardcastle 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Britain's FTSE 100 stock index, which sank to its lowest year level a month ago, chalked up a record closing high on Tuesday led by bullish retail sector sentiment. 
 "You probably couldn't have forecast a better background for the equity market than the one we've currently got," said one senior share trader. "The market has a lot going for it." 
 The blue chip index closed 19.5 points higher at 3,883.2, surpassing the previous 3,872.9 record it set just last week. 
 Gainers outweighed decliners by a margin of two to one but volume was a subdued 512.9 million shares as all eyes remained fixed on the outcome of the interest rate setting U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee, which was meeting as the London market closed. 
 The retail stocks which led an early advance were boosted by the latest economic figures which flagged an improvement in British consumer sentiment. 
 "The consumer credit figures this morning showed another booming month -- the consumer is back with a vengeance," another trader said. 
 But the return of the so-called "feel-good factor" in the retail sector may also reduce the likelihood of any further cuts in UK interest rates, traders said. 
 This view was shared by Britain's largest mortgage lender, the Halifax Building Society. 
 "(A rate cut) would be more politically inspired than by the needs of the housing market," Halifax chairman Jon Foulds told reporters at the company's interim results' presentation. 
 Leading the retail sector's advance, GUS was squeezed 23p higher to close at 663p, following the release of strong interim results from discount retailer Argos yesterday. 
 On the back of the same wave of optimism, electronics retailer Dixons gained 11p to 535p and Kingfisher ended 14p higher at 668p, with dealers saying some investors anticipate more positive news from other half year results in the sector. 
 Whether the UK share market as a whole continues to go from strength to strength is largely dependent on events across the Atlantic, especially and the outcome of the FOMC policy meeting. 
 "We've really seen little or no selling today, (and) most people are assuming there will be no change (in U.S. rates)," one senior dealer said. 
 But trade remained cautious in the U.S. and the Dow was little changed, up 3.7 points, when London markets closed. 
 "We are still looking for reasurrance on U.S. rates," a dealer said. "If they don't increase rates now, we want to know when are they likely to".

 UK: Silver fixes at two-month high, but gold lags. 
 Silver fixes at two-month high, but gold lags. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Silver fixed at its highest level since June 19, 1996 on Tuesday morning following buying by speculators late on Monday in New York. 
 Silver fixed at $5.2025 an ounce, up 12 cents from Monday's fix and eight cents above Monday's London close. 
 It had eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight. 
 But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week. "There has seen some good hedge-fund buying of silver call options, and also the underlying (silver metal) recently," a dealer said. Silver closed in London at $5.23, up 12 cents. 
 Options are popular with market speculators as they offer a cheap way into betting on price movements. 
 An option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a commodity at a set price at some specified future date. 
 "It's a purely technical move, but I can see it going for $5.30 this week," the dealer added. 
 Gold's reaction was half-hearted. The yellow metal closed just 90 cents firmer at $387.55. 
 "Gold has had a bit of a dismal performance. The move seems to be just in silver," one dealer said. 
 The grains markets which headlined the commodities' markets on Monday turned lower on forecasts of more favourable growing wheather in the North American wheat regions. 
 "The chances of frost were taken out of the forecasts for Canada," a Chicago-based trader said. 
 On the Chicago Board of Trade futures markets at 0945 CDT, wheat for September delivery was down 2-1/2 cents at $4.57. 
 September corn was down 1-1/2 cents at $3.62-1/2 and August soybeans were down 1-3/4 cents at $8.13. 
 Industrial metals were quiet with copper prices coming back $11.00 on the London Metal Exchange from $1,942 at Monday's close after stocks in the exchange's warehouses recorded a rise of 5,000 tonnes to 266,000 tonnes. 
 Dealers said the market's stock overhang had reduced the anxiety earlier in the year of finding metal to deliver to customers. Aluminium was only $1.00 lower at $1,489. 
 White sugar futures put in a fairly robust performance, though the lack of strong fundamental news capped the market below key resistance near the $355.50 area, traders said. 
 December cocoa futures raced to a six week high, then eased below 1,040 stg in modest activity. By mid afternoon the December contract was up 12 stg at 1,037 stg. 
 The coffee price reaction modestly to a drop of 6,259 60-kg bags in the U.S. certified coffee stockpile to 34,516 bags. 
 The November contract was up only $3 at $1,660 as the fall was within forecasters' expectations.

 UK Investment Trust discounts stable end July - AITC. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Average discounts on UK investment trusts were stable at the end of July at 10.86 percent, slightly down from the June average of 10.94 percent, a statement from the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) showed. 
 There was also evidence discounts could be narrowing again. Figures from the Datastream Consortium List showed the average discount at nine percent on August 14, the AITC said. 
 Ernest Fenton, director general of the AITC noted that discounts are "often misunderstood by individual investors." 
 He said "Discounts are not an automatic indication of poor performance or poor returns on investments. In fact, the most popular funds -- generalist investment trusts -- show a 11-12 percent discount and have an exemplary record over the last 10 years." 
 Since 1986, the average discount has hit a low of 4.11 percent in 1994 and a high of 22.08 percent in 1987, AITC data showed. 
 In sector averages at the end of June, property, Continental Europe, Emerging market, single country funds and venture and development capital funds had the highest discounts (above 18 percent) while the lowest discounts applied to Far East funds, including and excluding Japan. 
 At the end of July, the highest discounts hit North American, Continental Europe and single country funds while the lowest were closed end funds.

 UK: IBCA affirms Italian foreign currency ratings. 
 IBCA affirms Italian foreign currency ratings. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 European credit rating agency IBCA said on Tuesday it affirmed its long-term foreign currency debt rating of Italy at AA minus and said the country may have finally turned the corner in its battle for fiscal reform. 
 "The rating applies to $92.9 billion of senior and unsecured foreign currency debt obligations of the Republic and sets a ceiling for the foreign currency rating of all Italian entities," IBCA said in a statement. 
 IBCA also confirmed its rating of A1 plus for short-term foreign currency issues and assigned a long-term local currency rating of AAA to sovereign debt. 
 "The small reduction in the public debt to GDP ratio in 1995 - the first since 1980 - signals a possible turning point in Italy's problematic fiscal policy," the agency said. 
 But IBCA said the path would not be easy. 
 "A relatively small adverse shift in the macroeconomic environment will be sufficient to blow the government's public debt to gdp projections off course," it said. "IBCA is projecting that the public debt to GDP ratio will rise this year, although it should fall in the more favourable macroeconomic environment expected in 1997." 
 In July, rating agency Moody's Investors Service raised its foreign currency sovereign ceiling rating on Italy to Aa3 from A1. In late April, Standard & Poor's affirmed its AA foreign currency rating for Italy. 
 IBCA said Italy had considerable strengths as a sovereign credit. These were illustrated by "the continued dynamism" of the private sector, a current account surplus and a high savings ratio. "These aspects of the economy have allowed Italy to sustain high public debt without having to draw on foreign savings," it said.

 UK: Complaints surge over UK "demonic" political ads. 
 Complaints surge over UK "demonic" political ads. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 A British industry watchdog said on Tuesday it had been flooded with complaints about an advertising campaign that depicted opposition Labour leader Tony Blair with demonic eyes. 
 The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told Reuters it had received about 100 complaints and would decide in a few days whether the campaign broke rules that ban offensive ads and those that unfairly infringe on the privacy of public figures. 
 If the rules were breached by the ads, which were run by the incumbent Conservative Party in British newspapers this month, the ASA will ban the ads. 
 "The advertising industry itself doesn't want political advertising to degenerate into mud-slinging," an advertising industry source told Reuters. 
 The ASA has received written responses to the complaints from M&C Saatchi, the advertising agency that created the campaign and that was started last year by Maurice Saatchi and his brother, Charles. 
 The Saatchi brothers were ousted in December 1994 from Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, which they formed in 1970. 
 The ads showed Tony Blair with a manic grin and red demonic eyes gleaming out from behind a black strip. 
 British newspapers this week quoted the actor whose eyes were used for the ads, Scott Woods, as saying he was upset about the campaign. 
 He told newspapers he had known photos of his eyes were being used for a Conservative Party campaign, but not that they would be used to make Blair look evil. 
 Woods, who specialises in playing serial killers, pirates and demons because of his mad, staring eyes, said he was a Labour supporter and planned to vote for Blair.

 UK: London's Globe, an experiment in theatre history. 
 London's Globe, an experiment in theatre history. 
 Helen Smith 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 In a theatre open to London's often rainy skies, a troupe of actors begins a risky experiment on Wednesday to discover what William Shakespeare's plays were like when first peformed 400 years ago. 
 The Globe Theatre is a replica of the 20-sided wood-and-thatch arena which Shakespeare part-owned and where his finest works, including "Macbeth," "Hamlet" and "King Lear", were staged during his lifetime. 
 It is the realisation of the dream of American actor-director Sam Wanamaker, who died of cancer in 1993, just as the theatre's wooden framework was being put in place. 
 Wanamaker had waged a 40-year battle against bureacracy and commercial greed to get the new Globe built just yards (metres) from the site of the original on the south bank of the Thames, opposite St Paul's Cathedral. 
 His vision is still central to the 30 million pound ($46 million) Globe, which begins a "prologue season" on Wednesday with a production of "Two Gentlemen of Verona." 
 "Anyone who worked with Sam was very much influenced by what he wanted to put together," said Lennie James, who plays one of the "Two Gentlemen." 
 Interviewed under grey skies in the Globe's auditorium on Tuesday, James said the place feels permeated with a sense of history. 
 "When (artistic director Mark Rylance) first welcomed us onto the stage saying we were the first actors in 400 years to stand here, I got a real buzz," he said. 
 Wanamaker's aim was to recreate, as far as possible, the conditions that Shakespeare's actors worked under in the 16th and 17th centuries. 
 The audience, many of them standing, would have been crowded around the stage ready to heckle the actors and punish bad performances with volleys of rotten fruit. 
 The actors had little time to learn their roles and would not have seen the full script, which was kept carefully guarded for fear that it would be stolen by another theatre. 
 The Globe has been carefully recreated from historical records and what could be gleaned from excavation of the original, destroyed in 1644 by England's puritan rulers. But little is still known about the theatres of the day. 
 Rylance said he hoped that working before a live audience would help show up anything the historians got wrong. 
 "We do not claim that this is it," said the boyish Rylance. "This is the best we can do in 1996. There's bound to be more evidence and we look forward to it." 
 Notwithstanding his search for authenticity, Rylance's production will depart drastically from Shakespearian traditions. 
 The cast of "Two Gentlemen of Verona" will include women and black actors, both unheard of in Shakespeare's day, and the play is set in modern Italy. 
 Even less traditional, the Globe will be selling cushions for the hard seats and raincoats -- thunderstorms are in the weather forecast for the opening night. 
 The choice of "Two Gentleman of Verona", one of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays, has raised critics' eyebrows, but Rylance says it is symbolic. 
 It was written before the original Globe was built in 1599, just as the prologue predates the scheduled official opening of its successor in June 1997, he said.

 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 British Sky Broadcasting said on Tuesday it had not been charged mainstream UK corporation tax in its last financial year and did not expect to do so in the current year. 
 Finance director Richard Brooke said the company did not expect to pay corporation tax until 1997/98. 
 The company said in its results statement for the year to June 30, 1996 that there was no charge "as each company in the Group either incurred losses or made profits which were offset by tax losses brought forward or by group relief." 
 "There remain within the Group substantial tax losses and other timing differences which are expected to be available in the future to offset against Mainstream Corporation Tax liabilities," the statement added. 
 It said that during the year just ended the company had provided for 23.6 million stg of Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) on the year's dividends.

 BSkyB sees digital TV link with BT. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting could link up with British Telecom to provide new services when it launches digital television next year. 
 "That is a possibility," said BSkyB chief executive Sam Chisholm when asked about the prospect of linking with BT to supply interactive services. 
 BSkyB is planning to launch digital satellite television late next year and is reportedly talking to a number of partners about promoting and subsidising the launch. 
 "We need to be able to get decoders to customers at the best price," said Chisholm.   
 "There is no question that there is a very big demand for it (digital satellite) if you can get it right," he added. 
 He said that BSkyB was ideally placed for a digital launch thanks to the success of its analogue services. BSkyB now has some 5.5 million subscribers in Britain and Ireland. 
 Chisholm said he could not comment on negotiations with the BBC on setting up new channels based on BBC programming. 
 "Most of it is widely reported in the press...I don't want to add anything to it," he said. 
 BSkyB faces strong competition from cable and satellite channel group Flextech for the deal with the BBC.   
 Flextech, 51 percent owned by Tele-Communications Inc of Denver, is seen as the favourite to clinch an agreement as it could provide the BBC with access to the north American market.

 UK: Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher. 
 Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Silver prices were at their highest levels since mid-June on Tuesday after speculative buying sent the New York market surging overnight, dealers said. 
 Gold followed only reluctantly, but market analysts said it could eventually make a go of breaking through its recent price ceiling at just under $390 an ounce. 
 Silver was indicated at $5.20 an ounce, up eight cents from Monday's London close and its highest price since June 19. 
 It eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight. 
 But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week. 
 "There has seen some good hedge-fund buying of silver call options, and also the underlying (silver metal) recently," a dealer said. 
 Options are popular with market speculators as they offer a cheap way into betting on price movements. 
 An option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a commodity at a set price at some specified future date. 
 "It's a purely technical move, but I can see it going for $5.30 this week," the dealer added. 
 Technical analysts or chartists who follow detailed charts of past prices noted that the rally could run into selling at silver's 200-day moving average price of $5.33 per ounce. 
 In contrast, bullion fixed at just $387.10 an ounce, versus $386.40 on Monday afternoon and $386.25 in the morning. 
 "Gold has had a bit of a dismal performance. The move seems to be just in silver," one dealer said. 
 But some chartists said gold has scope to move higher. 
 "Obviously much depends on gold's ability to clear the critical resistance immediately below $390," said analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge. 
 "But silver's recovery following what is looking to be a false breakdown earlier below $5.00 adds to the evidence this may occur," she added. 
 Some analysts said gold was being cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in New York later on Tuesday in case of surprises regarding interest rates. 
 Another dampener was a slump in the South African rand. 
 "There's been some (South African gold) producer selling with the weaker rand," a dealer said, referring to the currency's overnight slump to 4.59 to the U.S. dollar. 
 Palladium was slightly firmer, up $0.60 at $124.65 and off recent 2-1/2 year lows. But dealers were disappointed palladium had not absorbed more strength from silver. 
 The same was true for platinum, which was up just $1.10 at $399.50, dealers said.

 M&G Group Plc said it had submitted proposals to take over management of the embattled Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust Plc (KEPIT). 
 "The only way to reduce the discount to net asset value at which KEPIT is trading is to look at unitisation," M&G spokeswoman Rachel Medill said. 
 August 19 was the closing date for bids for the 500 million pound trust, which attracted record subscriptions for a British investment trust when it was launched in 1994. Unitisation means shareholders would then hold units in a trust that owned shares, rather than owning shares directly.

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Physical electricity prices for next-day delivery in the western U.S. were firm Tuesday, but power for deferred month deliveries were traded mostly lower, brokers and marketers said. 
 Next-day prices were bolstered by Bonneville Power Administration raising its posting for 16-hour power blocks for Wednesday delivery by two dollars to $17.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), market sources said. 
 Deferred month values were weaker amid a second-day of active selling, they said. "People are seeing these outer months are well overvalued," said a Houston trader. 
 A substantial decline in the natural gas market also pressured electricity prices lower, traders said. 
 NYMEX September Gulf Coast natgas futures were in the $2.060 area, off more than 12 cents per million British thermal units. 
 In the physical market, California-Oregon Border (COB) prices for firm, peak delivery were quoted at $16.00-$17.00 per MWh, up from Monday's $15.00-$16.00, market sources said. 
 September COB power for firm, peak delivery was assessed at $17.10-$17.90, up from Monday's $17.00-$17.40 range. 
 October COB, with similar delivery terms, was pegged at $15.50-$15.90, down from $15.75-$16.60 on Monday. Firm, peak COB for the 1996 fourth-quarter was valued at $16.90-$17.25, flat from Monday. 
 At the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) point in Washington, firm, peak electricity prices for next-day delivery were quoted at $15.00-$15.50 per MWh, up from Monday's $14.50-$15.50. 
 September Mid-C electricity was pegged at $16.50-$17.10, down slightly from Monday's $16.50-$17.20. 
 Down at the Palo Verde (PV) switchyard near Phoenix, Ariz., next-day power for peak, firm delivery was valued at $21.00-$22.00 per MWh, near unchanged from Monday's range. 
 September firm, peak PV electricity was quoted at $20.75-$21.25, flat from Monday. 
 October PV electricity, with similary delivery terms, was assessed at $15.90-$16.10. Fourth-quarter PV prices was quoted at $16.30-$16.70, down from Monday's $16.90-$17.25 range. 
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co continued to hold power output from its 2,160 MW Diablo Canyon nuclear power facility at 75 percent of capacity because of a nearby wildfire in the Los Padres national forest.

 US mortgage-backeds mixed, tighter to Treasuries.

 U.S. mortgage-backed securities were mixed on Tuesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting with no announcement on interest rates. 
 Pass-throughs were unchanged to 2/32 higher in very light trading, traders said. Discount coupons lost their early gains -- about 3/32 -- while premiums generally held on. 
 Yields over Treasuries narrowed two to three basis points. 
 Treasuries slipped modestly after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but fixed-income analysts said government securities had been well-positioned ahead of the meeting.   
 Late on Tuesday, GNMA 30-year 7.5 percent coupons were up 1/32 at 99-05/32, yielding 110 basis points over 10-year Treasuries. 
 Comparable FNMAs were up 1/32 at 99-08/32. And FHLMC 30-year 7.5 percent pass-throughs were unchanged at 99-10/32. 
 With the FOMC behind them, analysts said the August employment report, set for release September 6, becomes the market's next focus. 
 While only three of 29 economists polled on Tuesday said the Fed will raise rates next month, several experts said payrolls could sway their interest rate forecasts.

 Natgas futures end down sharply as longs exit. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended down sharply Tuesday in a lackluster session, as longs rushed to liquidate amid perceptions a storm in the Caribbean would not threaten U.S. Gulf gas production, sources said. 
 September tumbled 13.4 cents to close near the day's low at $2.053 per million British thermal units. Oct settled 13 cents lower at $2.124. Others ended down by one to 10.5 cents. 
 "People are not expecting it (Hurricane Dolly) to affect a lot of production. I think it was a bit overdone and we could rebound a little from here, but it depends on what the storm does overnight," said one Houston-based trader.   
 But forecasters still expected Dolly to approach the Texas-Mexico border, and some traders remained concerned that a slight turn to the north could put offshore Texas platforms in jeopardy. 
 Hurricane Dolly slammed into Mexico's Yucatan peninsula Tuesday afternoon with 75 mph winds, moving west-northwest at 13 mph. At 1400 EDT, the center was located at 19.3 degrees north and 87.9 degrees west. 
 Cash prices at the U.S. Gulf Coast firmed slightly Tuesday to about the $2.10 area, still almost 20 cents below August indices. Midcon pipes scored similar gains to the low-$1.90s, about 20 cents under August 1 levels. 
 The 12-month strip tumbled 6.2 cents to $2.133. NYMEX said 33,849 Henry Hub contracts traded, up from Monday's revised tally of 24,317. 
 NYMEX September Henry Hub natgas futures expire Monday, August 26. 
 NYMEX September Permian natgas closed four cents lower at $1.82, while deferreds settled down by 3.5 cents but again were untraded. NYMEX said 30 Permian contracts traded, down from Monday's total of 85. 
 NYMEX September Permian natgas futures expire Wednesday August 28. 
 On the KCBT, September finished down by seven cents at $1.88, while deferreds ended one to six cents lower. The East/West spread narrowed by 6.4 cents to 17.3 cents (NYMEX premium).

 LDC debts seesaw in narrow ranges, ignore Fed. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 

 The U.S. interest rate status quo was shrugged off in the quiet trading of emerging market debts and the Brady bonds finished the day mostly flat. 
 "The absence of a rate hike was already priced in," said Shafiq Islam, emerging market fixed income strategist at Credit Suisse. "It is marginally positive." 
 Argentina Bradies came under light pressure as investors watched with concern how the new economy minisiter, Roque Fernandez, negotiates between raising taxes to cut deficits and appeasing the public to risk falling further behind fiscal target, traders said.   
 The International Monetary Fund officials are in Buenos Aires to review Argentine fiscal deficits which are expected to reach $6.6 billion this year. 
 Argentina FRBs eased 1/8 to 77-1/4 and Argentina Pars slipped 3/8 to 54-3/4. 
 Brazil fared slightly better than Argentina, with Brazil C adding 3/8 to 65-1/8. 
 "With or without (Brady bond) buy-back, Brazil papers may still have some room to rise," said a Brady trader.   
 While Brazil's trade deficit of $334 million in July would not pose a problem to the currency, the stalled reform continued casting a shadow, he said. 
 Mexico papers were underpinned by the robust 7.2 percent gross domestic product growth in the second quarter, but some market participants questioned if the optimism might be overstated. 
 "If the second quarter is compared to the first quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, you get only a one-percent growth," said Shafiq at Credit Suisse. 
 Mexico Pars rose 1/8 to 67-1/2 and Discount added 1/4 to 80-3/8. 
 Among East European papers, Bulgaria was depressed by recurring concerns about its weak currency and low level of reserves, traders said. 
 Bulgaria FLRB lost 1/2 to 33-1/4. 
 Russia debt prices retreated on profit-taking. 
 "We are comfortable with Russia," said a U.S. bank trader. With the IMF about to release the delayed tranche of aid and the overall low indebtedness, Russia debts were still relatively cheap, he said.

 API said gasoline stocks fell 864,000 barrels in the week to 197.79 million from a revised 198.65 million barrels that was previously reported as 197.64 million. Distillate stocks rose 1.83 million barrels to 106.12 million from 104.29 million.

 U.S. diesel tax suspended for pleasure boats. 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 President Clinton Tuesday signed legislation to suspend the 24.4 cents per gallon federal tax on diesel fuel used by recreational boaters. 
 The suspension, in effect from Aug. 27, 1996, to Dec. 31, 1997, was included in a law to raise the minimum wage. 
 "Seven days from now, our waterways will be less hazardous for many boaters who should be able to purchase the same red-dyed, non-taxed fuel used by commercial mariners, which is more widely available around the country," Michael Sciulla, government affairs director of the Boat Owners Association of the United States, said in a statement. 
 Recreational boaters have complained that the government's fuel-dying program caused fuel shortages and safety problems. 
 The Treasury Department must send a report to Congress by April 1, 1997, on alternative means of collecting the diesel tax, first levied in 1994.

 U.S. foreign crude interest wilts on NYMEX expiry. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 

 Interest in U.S. foreign crude remained subdued amid choppy outright price activity related to the expiry on Tuesday of NYMEX September crude futures. 
 The absence of September cargoes offered into the U.S. Gulf was still blamed on narrow profit margins. 
 "Apart from one or two Qua Iboes and maybe a Bonny Light, nobody's seen anything," a Houston trader said. 
 Vague rumors of Malaysian Tapis being offered for September delivery could not be immediately pinned down. 
 Overall, profit taking in crude futures kept discussion in physical markets to a minimum, traders said.   
 September West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was pegged at $22.80-90 a barrel, down 25 cents from Monday's cash market. 
 Latin American crude differentials, meanwhile, clawed higher amid tight supplies. 
 September Cusiana was heard offered close to WTI parity, up from October minus 27 cents fob in a recent deal, with late Sept asked at a shade under November WTI. 
 Spot Cano Limon for September was pegged around WTI minus $1.65-70 a barrel fob, after Ecopetrol's tender last week went for minus $1.65 a barrel, traders said. 
 A couple of September Oriente cargoes were seen available and priced around WTI minus $1.80. 
 The upgrading of Tropical Storm Dolly to a hurricane just before making landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula this afternoon, has so far not caused any crude shipping delays. 
 In the U.S. aftermarket, cash Brent traded at September Brent plus two cents fob for Aug 29-31, less than yesterday's trade at Sept plus 15 cents. 
 Brent intermonth Sep/Oct traded thrice at 50 cents, off 10 cents from morning levels.

 USA: US CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - Home on a range. 
 US CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - Home on a range. 
 Jose Paulo Vicente 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-21 
 
 U.S. credit markets will likely remain rangebound on Wednesday as players focus on scant fresh economic data and the annoucement of the monthly supply of two- and five-year notes, analysts said. 
 "I think we're going to consolidate for a while ... people are going over the next week or so start thinking about things that might influence the Fed at their next meeting," said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. 
 The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee met on Tuesday and decided, as expected, to keep interest rates unchanged.   
 The federal funds rate was kept at 5.25 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee will meet next on September 24. 
 Analysts said the market's next main hurdles will be the employment report (Sept 6) and the National Association of Purchasing Management index on (Sept 3). Both indicators are for the month of August. 
 "The employment and the NAPM are going to be two very key indicators," Thayers said. "But between now and then I think that if we were to see continued strength on commodity prices or a weaking of the dollar, that could be something the market would be focusing on too," he added.   
 On Wednesday, the market will take in import and export prices for July at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT. Later in the day, players will get the federal budget figures for July. 
 A Reuters survey of economists show they expect the data, due out at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT, to stay at a negative $25.2 billion against a positive $34.1 billion in June. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City survey is also due out on Wednesday at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT. 
 "We'll have some data tomorrow, but they really are not expect to move the market. I guess we're still in a range here," said a trader at a U.S. investment bank.   
 Analysts see the yield on the 30-year T-bonds ranging between 6.75 percent and 6.85 percent on Wednesday. 
 Market watchers will also keep a very close eye on the annoucement of fresh supply on Wednesday, when the Treasury will set its monthly two- and five-year note auctions. 
 Analysts expect the Treasury to sell roughly $18.75 bilion in two-year notes and $12.5 billion in five-year securities. 
 Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at consulting firm I.E.D.E., said there is a growing sentiment in the market that the Federal Reserve might keep interest rates steady throughout the year of 1996.   
 Stilles added that "the only way you could justify the two-year note getting underwritten below six percent and the five-year note below 6-3/8 percent is if that idea gets and retains more popularity." 
 Otherwise, Stiles said the two's and five's would have to back up and put a little risk back into the yields in order to lure new buyers to the auctions. 
 On Tuesday, the 30-year bond spent the day in a lull to trade down 1/32 at 99-12/32 in late trade. Its yield was at 6.80 percent.   
 The Fed refrained from operations in the open market on Tuesday. The federal funds rate is seen opening at 5.13 percent on Wednesday, analysts said.

 USA: Huntsman drops offer to acquire Rexene. 
 Huntsman drops offer to acquire Rexene. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Privately held Huntsman Corp said it is dropping a $460 million unsolicited bid for Rexene Corp after its two offers were rejected. 
 Huntsman also said it would not pursue a hostile tender offer for Rexene, a move that some Wall Street takeover traders had anticipated. 
 "I'm washing my hands of the entire matter. Huntsman Corp is not interested in pursuing further negotiations nor in commencing an unsolicted tender offer at this time. It is simply not worth the aggravation," chief executive officer Jon Huntsman said in a news release.   
 Huntsman said it made the decision after Rexene financial adviser Schroder-Wertheim indicated the Rexene board would reject bids substantially above its $15 per share offer. 
 Huntsman's first bid of $14 per share was rejected by Rexene on July 22. The Salt Lake City-based chemical company then sweetened the offer to $15 per share on August 1, but Rexene rejected that bid as well. 
 The unsolicited bid also included the assumption of $175 million of debt. 
 Rexene did not have any immediate comment on Huntsman's decision.   
 But Huntsman warned that the cyclical chemical industry is already seeing a decline in margins and prices. In spurning the offer, Rexene said shareholder value would be boosted by its strategic investment plan, which includes additional capacity and the expansion of product offerings. 
 "In my opinion, Rexene's shareholders won't see our offering in the value of Rexene stock for years to come. The shareholders should be very disappointed," Huntsman said. 
 The move by Huntsman marks the second time in recent months that the nation's largest privately held chemical company, long known for successful acquisitions, failed to win a target company. 
 Family-owned Huntsman launched a bid for Sterling Chemicals Inc in April, but the effort failed when the target instead opted for a management and investor buyout. 
 Shares of Rexene, which were trading at 9 before Huntsman launched its bid, tumbled 2 to 10-1/2 in after-hours trading.

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co (PG&E) said its Diablo Canyon nuclear power units are expected to reach full output Wednesday after being scaled back Monday because of a wildfire in the nearby Los Padres forest. 
 "We hope to be at 100 percent power tomorrow sometime," said PG&E spokeswoman Arlene Morris-Versaw, adding the California Department of Forestry started backfires to contain the blaze about two hours ago (1100 PDT/1800 GMT). 
 Efforts to fight the blaze earlier today were hampered by strong winds. 
 "The plan is for the backburn to continue until tonight," she said. "The winds are (now) favorable." 
 If the backfires are successful, the utility will check for damage to the insulators of the transmission lines before ramping up both Diablo Canyon units to full power, she said. 
 The plant's two units, with a combined capacity of 2,160 megawatt (MW), are currentrly producing at 75 percent of capacity. 
 On Monday, PG&E, as a precaution, shifted all transmission from Diablo Canyon to just one 5,000 kilovolt (KV) line after shutting the two 5,000 KV lines closest to the fire. 
 Diablo Canyon is at Avila Beach on the California coast.

 Main Street and Main Inc said sales at its restaurants continue at softer-than-expected levels with same store revenue figures since the end of the company's second quarter down roughly five percent. 
 Sales continue to remain soft, but we (are focused) on ways to increase earnings," Joe Panter, president, said in a statement along with the company's second quarter results. 
 For the quarter ended July 1, the restaurant operator lost $0.92 a share, including a $0.94 per share charge, versus a $0.09 profit one year ago. Same store sales were off two percent for the quarter and 1.7 percent for the six months.   
 Main Street said the lower same store sales were attributable, principally, to six restaurants. The company operates a total of 43 casual dining restaurants. 
 The company noted the performance of its one "Front Row Sports Grill" negatively effected earnings and it is "considering various alternatives" about its future. 
 Main Street did not say what those alternatives were and a company official was not immediately available to comment. 
 The company said its total $7.4 million charge covered the write-off of one promissory note, some real estate, pre-opening costs of three restaurants and and other expenses.

 USA: FOCUS - Fed stays put, but rate hike seen inevitable. 
 FOCUS - Fed stays put, but rate hike seen inevitable. 
 Chris Stetkiewicz 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 While the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at its meeting Tuesday, the odds of monetary tightening are likely to mount as 1996 comes to a close, analysts said. 
 Fed policy-makers astutely resisted pressures earlier this summer to raise short-term rates, but economic data over the next several weeks will almost certainly force the Fed to grudgingly tighten credit later this year, analysts said.   
 "My guess is (Fed tightening) is going to be right back on tap after the August data start coming out," said Salomon Brothers economist Brian Jones. 
 In a Reuters poll of 28 economists to be released later on Tuesday, a majority predicted the Fed would move to tighten credit at its November 13 meeting. 
 The Fed has held its target for the federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- at 5.25 percent since January 31, 1996.   
 Despite signs of strong economic growth since then, inflation remains quite low, and the Fed has refrained from raising rates in the absence of more troubling data. 
 But upcoming U.S. employment data could change all that, analysts said. 
 Persistent job growth threatens to shatter the economy's recent low-inflation trend and the Fed will not stand idly by and watch that happen, analysts said.   
 "The job market is still quite firm. We'll need to see jobless claims move back up pretty soon in order to confirm the economic slowdown story," said Josh Feinman, global markets economist at BT Securities Corp. 
 Jobless claims' four-week moving average reached a seven-year low last week, adding to recent warnings of pending wage inflation. 
 That also suggests the economy continues to churn out new jobs at a pace likely to drag the unemployment rate lower than July's 5.4 percent reading, analysts said.   
 The absence of faster inflation amid such robust job creation has many analysts scratching their heads and wondering how long the Fed will hold monetary policy steady. 
 "Strong job growth has persisted long enough that the Fed will certainly have to stand up and take notice," said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank. 
 The Fed's inflation-fighting reputation has flourished as the board has kept rates steady with inflation holding below 3.0 percent even as the economy chugs along nicely.   
 Critics initially blasted the Fed for failing to tighten credit at its July 2-3 FOMC meeting when a report just two days later showed that 239,000 new jobs were created in June. 
 But a month later the July report showed a decline to 193,000 in new nonfarm payrolls and, perhaps more important, a slight drop in average hourly earnings. 
 Fed officials had predicted a slowdown in real gross domestic product from the robust 4.2 percent second-quarter clip. The dip in payroll growth suddenly made that forecast look brilliant, analysts said.   
 "So far the Fed has done the right thing by keeping its powder dry," Schlossberg said. "There is still a risk the Fed could fall behind the curve, but right now it looks like the economic slowdown is happening." 
 The August employment report due September 6 could radically alter the terrain, however. 
 Salomon's Jones predicts a whopping payrolls gain of 300,000 and an official jobless rate of 5.2 percent in the August report. If correct, that could force the Fed's hand.   
 "People tried to make the July report look weak," Jones added. "But it's not like the July numbers mean we don't have to worry about tightening anymore." 
 Yet most analysts still believe the economy will decelerate in time to minimize any future inflation bubble, which may allow the Fed to keep the funds rate steady for several more months. 
 "They may have gotten lucky, but the economy has validated the Fed's strategy of waiting until they see data for the second half of the year," Feinman said. 
 "They did say the (inflation) risks were to the upside, but that the whole point of their strategy was to wait until they saw how the third quarter was turning out," he added. 
 Analysts said Fed officials would certainly prefer to postpone any rate hikes until after the November 5 presidential election.

 HOUSTON 1996-08-20 
 
 Georgia electric power cooperative Oglethorpe Power Corp said on Tuesday it is soliciting bids from power marketers to supply power on its system through the remainder of the year. 
 The cooperative, which has peak demand of more than 5,000 megawatts, also said two bidders -- LG&E Energy Corp's LG&E Power and Enron Corp's Enron Power Marketing -- are actively bidding on a long-term power marketing pact with the rural Georgia cooperative. 
 The short-term deal should be in place when the Enron pact expires at the end of August, and the long-term deal should be closed by year-end, an Oglethorpe spokesman said. 
 "We are currently in detailed negotiations, and will continue to work to accomplish that goal," said Robert Hosfeld, manager of system control for the cooperative. 
 The short-term power deal would replace a four-month pact with Enron, which supplied power to the cooperative in exchange for output from its generating plants. 
 Four marketers, including the LG&E and Enron units and consortiums formed by Duke Power/Louis Dreyfus and Morgan Stanley/PECO had been bidding on the long-term pact with Oglethorpe, which has 39 members and serves 2.6 million people.

 Southern Union sues to block merger. 
 AUSTIN, Texas 1996-08-20 
 
 Southern Union Co said on Tuesday it has filed a lawsuit to block a merger between United Cities Gas Co and Atmos Energy Corp. 
 Southern Union said it alleges that United Cities executives and directors failed to perform their fiduciary duties by approving the proposed deal with Atmos.   
 Southern Union, which holds 854,300 shares, or 6.5 percent, of United Cities, is seeking to block the deal until the United Cities board exercises its fiduciary duties. Southern Union wants United Cities to provide confidential information so it can make an informed takeover offer. 
 Atmos Energy and United Cities Gas, both natural gas providers, agreed last month that Atmos would acquire United Cities in a stock swap. 
 Atmos Energy declined to comment since it had not seen the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. United Cities was not immediately available for comment. 
 Atmos and United Cities filed a complaint with the Missouri Public Service Commission on August 6, 1996 alleging that Southern Union's purchases of United Cities shares violated state utility regulations. Southern Union said it filed a counter complaint saying it was entitled to the usual privileges of ownership associated with United Cities stock.

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Nasdaq stocks closed lower on continued profit-taking in high technology issues and some analysts say the correction is drawing to a close. 
 The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 6.24 points, or 0.55 percent at 1124.67. Declines led advances 2053 to 1923 on volume of about 413 million shares. 
 "The Nasdaq market is still being weighed down by profit-taking in the high technologies," said Chris Callies, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston.   
 "The profit-taking seems to be focusing on the larger cap stocks, which is an indication that it has gotten a bit long in the tooth and that the correction is getting pretty old." 
 HBO & Co shares slumped 5-1/4 to 56-1/2 after Morgan Keegan started coverage of the stock with underperform. 
 Viking Office Products Inc shares rose one to 24-1/8 after the company reported quarterly results in line with First Call estimates. Stewart & Stevenson Services Inc was down 1-5/16 at 20-1/16 after the company reported second quarter earnings of $0.16 per share before charges. The First Call estimate was for net of $0.34 per share.

 U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Lawsuits turn focus to tobacco. 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 
 
 Two new lawsuits against tobacco companies helped drive options activity in Philip Morris Cos Inc on the American Stock Exchange, traders said on Tuesday. 
 Earlier in the day, Kansas and Arizona each filed lawsuits against tobacco companies including Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp's RJR Reynolds Tobacco 
 "There really is a lot of speculation going on with the new court cases out in the Midwest," said Andrew Schwarz, senior partner at AGS Specialist Partners. "People are using a variety of strategies, both on the put and call side."   
 Despite the new lawsuits, Philip Morris shares were ahead 1-1/4 at 91-1/8 in afternoon trading. 
 Schwarz said activity in Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco options included protective put buying, speculative call buying and call selling. 
 "Everybody has a different opinion" on the outcome of the various lawsuits, and players were developing their options strategies based on their expectations, Schwarz said. 
 Most action in Philip Morris options was on the put side, led by the September 80 put, with 2,123 contracts traded. With the underlying stock up, the option fell 3/16 to 3/4.   
 Other active Philip Morris puts included the September 90, with nearly 1,400 contracts traded, the September 85 with about 500 and the December 85 with nearly 400. 
 Among the calls, the September 90 and 100 each traded more than 1,000 contracts and the September 95 traded nearly 1,000. 
 Activity was relatively heavy right through the January 1997 series, with the January 90 call trading more than 400 contracts and the corresponding put trading about 260. The March 1997 100 call traded about 125 contracts. 
 For RJR Nabisco, most options trading was on the call side but combined volume in the RJR October 25 put was 260.   
 In other trading, investors were actively buying puts on shares of Cyrix Corp. 
 On the CBOE, the Cyrix September 15 put traded 533 contracts and the September 12-1/2 traded 314. The same two options traded 425 and 220 contracts, respectively, on the American Stock Exchange. 
 On the Pacific Stock Exchange, the Cyrix September 15 put traded 260 contracts and the September 12-1/2 traded 105. Call volume on Cyrix was minimal. 
 "It looks to me like just a straight downward bet," said Harrison Roth, a first vice president at Cowen & Co. Cyrix shares were off 5/16 at 14-1/4 Tuesday afternoon.   
 Call options on shares of healthcare information company Medaphis Corp remained relatively active, nearly a week after the stock lost 60 percent of its value. 
 Combined volume was 753 on the Medaphis September 15 call, 150 on the September 12-1/2 and 190 on the September 20 call. 
 Put volume was nominal. 
 Schwarz at AGS Specialist Partners said many investors had speculated the stock would rebound after its collapse, but that some who bought the calls when they were listed last Thursday had already sold off their holdings. -Gregory Crawford, 312 408-8750/E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com

 The U.S. Transportation Department on Tuesday had no comment on a Financial Times story saying Britain was taking a tough stand in its talks on a new aviation accord with the United States. 
 The paper, reporting the British posture in the ongoing talks on new accord, added that Britain was not ready to sign an "open skies" agreement with the United States similar to the free market pact it had signed with Germany.

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Chile's state oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo (ENAP) has issued another buy tender for October crude oil, attempting to secure supplies in a thin market, traders said on Tuesday. 
 The new tender asks for 960,000 barrels of crude to be delivered during October 15-18, and closes on Thursday. 
 ENAP last week purchased 380,000 barrels of Ecuadorian Oriente from a trader at a price around Ecuador's sales formula plus five cents (fob), with an option for a second cargo. 
 "They are probably still trying to secure intermediate West African crudes, and at a better price," a trader said, noting prior offers may not have been at competitive prices. 
 ENAP recently bought crudes from Gabon, Angola and Nigeria, but expensive premiums and costly freight have proved prohibitive, while regional supplies have also been thin.

 USA: Dow ends stronger as Fed leaves rates unchanged. 
 Dow ends stronger as Fed leaves rates unchanged. 
 Betty Wong 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 The Dow industrials bounded higher as the Federal Reserve voted to keep monetary policy unchanged, allowing Wall Street to hurdle any lingering fears of a surprise tightening. 
 "It was as expected. If we can neutralize the interest-rate factor here, prices can go higher," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. "The last two weeks of August are the sweet spot for the market -- no corporate reports and no major economic releases."  The Dow industrials rose 22 to about 5722.   
 The blue chip index is within a stone's throw of the record close of 5778.00 on May 22. 
 Weakness in high-technology issues pressured the tech-studded Nasdaq Composite, off six to about 1125. But the broader market was firmer with gainers beating losers 6-5 on still paltry NYSE volume of about 336 million shares. 
 The long bond fell 2/32 to yield 6.80 percent after news the Fed opted to hold rates steady amid signs the economy is cooling off without inflation heating up. The decision kept the independent Fed out of the line of political fire in the runup to the Nov 5 presidential and congressional elections.   
 U.S. blue chips momentarily pared gains after the Fed news on a sell-program that wiped 12 points off the Dow, according to Birinyi Associates Inc. 
 "For a few seconds it looked like 'buy the rumor, sell the fact.' But then the Dow came back up and it's hard to find any index doing anything spectacular," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. 
 "It's a Dow-inspired rally...because of the liquidity factor, visibility and safety," he added. 
 As for individual sectors, Legg Mason's Cripps noted some further strength in oils and weaker software service providers.   
 Texaco added 5/8 to 89-3/4 and Exxon rose 1/4 to 83-3/4. 
 HBO & Co slumped 5-1/4 to 56-1/2 after Morgan Keegan started coverage of the stock with an underperform rating, a tarder said. The analyst and HBO officials were unavailable. 
 First Data fell 3-1/2 to 77-3/8. Morgan Stanley trimmed 1996 and 1997 estimates but maintained its outperform. 
 Tobacco stocks were mostly higher as Kansas and Arizona joined other states and municipalities seeking damages from the tobacco industry. Philip Morris added 1-5/8 to 91-1/2, RJR Nabisco slipped 1/4 to 26-1/2, smokeless tobacco maker UST rose 1/8 to 31-3/4, Loews added 1/4 to 77-7/8.   
 Capstar Hotel, a Washington, D.C.-based company that invests in and manages hotels nationwide, was unchanged at 18 in its Wall Street debut. 
 Griffin Gaming soared 7-1/8 to 19-3/8 after it agreed to merge with Sun International Hotels in a stock deal. Sun International fell 3-5/8 to 48-1/8. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette downgraded Sun to outperform from buy. 
 Tylan General rose 2-7/8 to 13-1/8 after news it is exploring the possible sale of the company and added it has already received some inquiries from potential buyers.   
 Among technology issues, Cisco Systems lost one to 55, 3Com lost 1-15/16 to 43 and Intel was off 1-1/4 to 79-1/2. 
 The Nasdaq Composite fell 6.24 to 1124.67. 
 The S&P 500 index fell 0.89 to 665.69.

 CHELMSFORD, Mass 1996-08-20 
 
 MRS Technology Inc, encouraged by momentum in orders for a line of its printers, said Tuesday it plans to "soft pedal" its recent effort to court a merger partner. 
 The company cited two orders from U.S. semiconductor manufacturers for its recently introduced Model 5200GHR PanelPrinter in this year's fourth quarter. 
 Although it plans to ease away from courting a merger partner, the company said it will continue to consider forging relationships with two or more beta-site users for the company's new Model 70000 PanelPrinter.

 USA: FDA action on Lilly's Zyprexa seen imminent. 
 FDA action on Lilly's Zyprexa seen imminent. 
 Kevin Drawbaugh 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 
 
 Approval of Eli Lilly & Co's new anti-schizophrenia drug, Zyprexa, is expected to come soon from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, analysts said. 
 Marketing clearance for the drug, known generically as olanzapine, would put Lilly in the front of a parade of new anti-schizophrenia medications coming on the U.S. market. 
 "We expect approval yet this year ... There's been no hint of any issues" from the FDA that might cause delay, said Lilly spokesman Edward West. 
 Wall Street analysts said approval could come this month.   
 The FDA has not scheduled an advisory committee hearing for Zyprexa. West said Lilly has no indication that a committee hearing will be set. Analysts said the drug likely will be cleared without committee deliberations. 
 "The big expectation would be that Zyprexa will be approved ... That's what's on everybody's radar screen," said Smith Barney pharmaceuticals analyst Christina Heuer. 
 Zyprexa received a positive opinion in June from the European Union's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. European marketing approval likely will follow, analysts said. 
 Several competing products are in the pipeline.   
 Close behind Lilly are Abbott Laboratories Inc with Serlect, Zeneca Group Plc with Seroquel and Pfizer Inc with Ziprasidone. All are expected to hit the market within the next 12 months. 
 Already on the market are Johnson & Johnson's Risperdal, Sandoz AG's Clozaril and the benchmark treatment available since 1967, haloperidol, as well as a host of less frequently prescribed drugs. 
 Studies have shown that one in 100 people is schizophrenic. Estimates of the annual U.S. market for treating the disease range from $1 billion to $4.5 billion. 
 Looking at the huge success of Lilly's Prozac in treating clinical depression, drugmakers are hoping to score equally impressive wins with the new anti-schizophrenics.

 USA: NY precious metals end steady, Fed makes no move. 
 NY precious metals end steady, Fed makes no move. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended little changed Tuesday, after news at the close the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at its latest Open Market Committee Meeting, as expected. 
 "The Fed's move to keep monetary policy unchanged was expected, but most precious metals have been basing recently, after the slide earlier in the year, with most players now perhaps a bit too complacent about the lack of volatility," Paine Webber analyst Bernard Savaiko said. 
 "The U.S. elections later this year, or signs of inflation, could still cause a breakout," he said.   
 "Few were expecting silver's break out from a two month range Monday, but silver held it's gains today, with a test of further resistance around $5.28 now possible," he said. 
 COMEX September silver ended unchanged at $5.21 an ounce after trading in a $5.170-5.230 range, on total estimated volume of 22,000 lots. 
 "Silver was getting too cheap relative to gold with the gold/silver ratio up around 76 or 77 recently," he said. 
 The jump in silver prices Monday to two month highs lowered the ratio to back to 74.2. 
 "The approaching first delivery date for the September COMEX contract, which still has some 270 million ounces of open interest, may have provided some incentive to go long," one analyst said. 
 COMEX December gold ended up $0.50 an ounce at $392.90, after trading in a narrow $392.20-393.00 range. 
 On the charts, gold's uptrend since late June still looks intact, traders said, but the rally's momentum has waned and further gains may just prompt more producer hedging. 
 Bullion was quoted $387.50/388.00 in New York near the close, from $387.10 at the London afternoon fix, and a New York close Monday at $386.90/387.40. 
 "The reduced probability that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy ahead of the November presidential elections should help keep gold prices steady until end user demand begins to improve again," Smith Barney analyst David Rinehimer said. 
 The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting (FOMC) is due on September 24. 
 NYMEX October platinum ended up $1.10 an ounce at $404.10, while NYMEX September palladium closed up $1.50 an ounce at $127.25. 
 "Support in palladium seems to be forming at $124 and is not likely to be penetrated near term," one analyst said. 
 Palladium slid to two and a half year lows last week. 
 "The large open interest in the September NYMEX price could lead prices to push back to $130-136 in the next two weeks."

 U.S. West next-day power firm; back-months lower. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Physical electricity prices for next-day delivery in the western U.S. were firm Tuesday, but power for deferred month deliveries were traded mostly lower, brokers and marketers said. 
 Next-day prices were bolstered by Bonneville Power Administration raising its posting for 16-hour power blocks for Wednesday delivery by two dollars to $17.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), market sources said. 
 Deferred month values were weaker amid a second-day of active selling, they said. "People are seeing these outer months are well overvalued," said a Houston trader. 
 A substantial decline in the natural gas market also pressured electricity prices lower, traders said. 
 NYMEX September Gulf Coast natgas futures were in the $2.060 area, off more than 12 cents per million British thermal units. 
 In the physical market, California-Oregon Border (COB) prices for firm, peak delivery were quoted at $16.00-$17.00 per MWh, up from Monday's $15.00-$16.00, market sources said. 
 September COB power for firm, peak delivery was assessed at $17.10-$17.90, up from Monday's $17.00-$17.40 range. 
 October COB, with similar delivery terms, was pegged at $15.50-$15.90, down from $15.75-$16.60 on Monday. Firm, peak COB for the 1996 fourth-quarter was valued at $16.90-$17.25, flat from Monday. 
 At the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) point in Washington, firm, peak electricity prices for next-day delivery were quoted at $15.00-$15.50 per MWh, up from Monday's $14.50-$15.50. 
 September Mid-C electricity was pegged at $16.50-$17.10, down slightly from Monday's $16.50-$17.20. 
 Down at the Palo Verde (PV) switchyard near Phoenix, Ariz., next-day power for peak, firm delivery was valued at $21.00-$22.00 per MWh, near unchanged from Monday's range. 
 September firm, peak PV electricity was quoted at $20.75-$21.25, flat from Monday. 
 October PV electricity, with similary delivery terms, was assessed at $15.90-$16.10. Fourth-quarter PV prices was quoted at $16.30-$16.70, down from Monday's $16.90-$17.25 range. 
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co continued to hold power output from its 2,160 MW Diablo Canyon nuclear power facility at 75 percent of capacity because of a nearby wildfire in the Los Padres national forest.

 USA: US fast food chains see little minimum wage impact. 
 US fast food chains see little minimum wage impact. 
 Patricia Commins 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 
 
 A 90-cent increase in the U.S. minimum wage will have little short-term impact on most fast food restaurants, since the competition for workers is keeping pay rates above the federally mandated standard. 
 "The (real) 'minimum wage' is what the closest McDonald's pays or it could be the local Pizza Hut," George Goulson, senior vice president of A&W Restaurants Inc, said. 
 But longer term, the industry fears that workers, who are already making more than the new minimum wage, will be looking for a raise to maintain the pay premium.   
 Earlier Tuesday, President Clinton signed into law the first rise in the minimum wage in five years, boosting the wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25. 
 "Our average crew wage is about $5.20 (an hour) so short-term there is not going to be any impact," said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc, which operates 4,307 restaurants in the United States. 
 But higher minimum wages will raise total wages by about $500,000 over the next 12 months at American Restaurant Partners L.P., which operates 62 Pizza Hut restaurant franchises.   
 "If you raise someone who started in the last two months (to the new minimum wage level), you also have to raise everybody else," said Terry Freund, chief financial officer of American Restaurant Partners. 
 Beyond the minimum wage requirements, competition for workers, from cooks to delivery drivers, has forced many fast-food chains to pay up to hire good help, particularly in metropolitan markets. That competition is being driven by an increase in restaurant openings. 
 "There are neighborhoods where we have to pay $6.00 an hour to $6.50 or $7.00 to get" good workers, Lynch added.   
 Fast-food industry executives said there has been competition for workers since the late 1980s, although the increase in restaurant openings is making the search for employees more intense. 
 Another problem for quick-service restaurants is that wage competition from other employers often lures experienced workers away. A fast-food worker, for example, may be able to bring home more pay as a waiter or waitress at a casual dining establishment where they could receive $50 or $60 a night in tips, executives said. 
 "For QSRs (quick service restaurants)...it's even tougher to keep the kids," Roger Lipton, president of Lipton Financial Services, said.

 USA: U.S. debt futures finish mixed after FOMC meeting. 
 U.S. debt futures finish mixed after FOMC meeting. 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 
 
 U.S. debt futures finished mixed, with the short end settling near the day's highs, while the long end wrapped up a light, lackluster session on the defensive, traders and analysts said. 
 However, both U.S. T-bond and Eurodollar futures are seen inching up slightly in the near term after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its much-awaited meeting without raising rates. 
 U.S. Septmeber bonds set a session low of 110-23/32 in a knee-jerk reaction to the FOMC's announcement that there was no change in the U.S. monetary policy.   
 Several traders said one firm sold 7,000 September bond contracts after the FOMC announcement, which helped pressure the contract through the day's previous low of 110-27/32. 
 "They just loaded up the pit with supply," one floor source said. 
 The contract traded inside Monday's range of 111-13/32 to 110-24/32 for most of the day, and most contracts closed only 01/32 lower. 
 "That doesn't exactly lead me to expect much in the way of price action on Wednesday," one trader said.   
 "Between now and then, there is not much to change things," said John Nyhoff, vice president and economist of Mitsubishi Financial Futures. 
 Nyhoff expects Eurodollars to rise slightly, with December climbing to the 94.50 area. 
 On Wednesday, July import and export prices will be released at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT and the July federal budget will be released at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT.   
 At the end of pit trade, September T-bonds were down 01/32 to 110-28/32, 10-year notes were flat at 108-19/32, munibonds rose 05/32 to 115-09/32, December Eurodollars were up one basis point at 94.21 and March Eurodollars were also up a basis point at 94.11, while March T-bills were one point higher at 94.69.

 RENO, Nev. 1996-08-20 

 The Sands Regent said Tuesday it filed a lawsuit against the Mississippi Port Authority and the Mississippi Department of Economic Development, because they refused to give Copa clearance to expand its casino operations in Gulfport, Mississippi. 
 The suit also comes in response to recent notifications by the authority and the development group that Copa must vacate its casino site when its lease expires in October 1999. 
 In its suit, filed in Circuit Court in Harrison County, Mississippi, Sands alleges failure to deal in good faith, breach of contract and misrepresentation.   
 Sands Regent said Copa had wanted to build a hotel near the site and bring in a casino barge to replace or supplement the current casino vessel. 
 Copa is asking for monetary damages and declaratory relief giving them the right to build the hotel and bring in a new barge. 
 The Port Authority has said it needs the location to expand shipping and related commercials activitie, according to Sands Regent.

 USA: Novell takes on Intranet market. 
 Novell takes on Intranet market. 
 Barbara Grady 
 BURLINGAME, Calif 1996-08-20 
 
 Novell Inc, saying its future growth and survival is at stake, launched an aggressive push into the Intranet market by introducing IntranetWare, a network platform adapted from Novell's NetWare network operating system to fully open standards for operating corporate Intranets. 
 The Orem, Utah software company has been the leading vendor of network operating system platform. But its NetWare has a history as a proprietary system, although Novell has made revisions to gradually open it to standards compliant.   
 Consequently, Novell has been perceived in the market as out-of-the-loop as the tide of corporate interest in developing Internet-like Intranets has swept through the business world this year. 
 "Fundamentally our future is at stake here," said Novell executive vice president Steven Markman when asked the importance of IntranetWare's launch to Novell's strategy. "If we are looking for growth, the only way we are going to get it is with open standards, Internet-Intranet based network services tied to network services," he said. "This is survival, it is fundamental."   
 With IntranetWare, which will be generally available in October, Novell will be shipping a whole series of Intranet applications and network management tools, including a NetWare Web server, a fast server which integrates Novell's existing Directory Services product, GroupWise 5.0 a messaging and collaboration application, and ManageWise 2.1 an Intranet network management solution. 
 Executives demonstrating the products at a press conference here said they hope to convince the market that IntranetWare and its associated products combine the reliability, robustness and security features of the old NetWare platform with the open easy-to-access features of an Intranet.   
 NetWare has about 55 million users and has been a market leader among corporate networking platforms. 
 But analysts have said Novell stood to lose that distinction if it did not move into the Intranet direction. 
 International Data Corp analyst Mark Levitt said Novell would face too much of a risk if it did not answer the market demand for Intranet products. 
 Indeed, Markman said many customers have asked Novell to make its network products Intranet based. 
 The question remains, however, whether or not Novell launched its Intranet strategy and products soon enough.   
 Some analysts said Novell customers have had to wait a year for direction from Novell about how to migrate from NetWare to an Intranet network and relied on others meanwhile. 
 "The market is ripe for Intranet solutions and I think they've hit the needs right on. People are going to be more accepting of an Intranet solution from a company with a large installed base like Novell," said Ron Rappaport, research associate at Zona Research. 
 "The question is are they late." 
 Markman maintained that Novell is not late, saying that customers are just now figuring out what Intranets are.

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 U.S. Mid-Atlantic spot electricity was trading steady for short-term deals and lower in longer-term trade with below-normal temperatures expected through the region by next week, industry sources said. 
 "Next week is coming off pretty good, the six-to-ten day forecast is calling for cooler weather," said one broker. 
 Prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) power pool for next day, on peak delivery were discussed relatively steady in the $29.00-31.00 range from $27.00-31.00 on Monday. 
 The next day prices were holding at levels above those seen last week. 
 "The weather is probably a factor, we are seeing some pretty good loads today," said one trader, adding "the prices we are seeing are still low compared to what we would see if we broke the 90s (degrees Fahrenheit)." 
 Off-peak next day power was talked at $15.50-17.00. 
 PJM power for firm, peak delivery for the three remaining days of this week was talked lower in the $28.00-29.00 range from $28.50-31.00 range on Monday, the industry sources said. 
 Power for the five business days of next week was discussed lower at $24.75-25.50 from a range of $25.75-28.00 per megawatt hour on Monday, the brokers and marketers said. 
 September PJM power, also for firm, peak delivery, dipped in early trade and rebounded slightly to afternoon discussion at $22.20-22.75 with $22.50 said to have traded, although the trade was unconfirmed. 
 September PJM was talked at $23.00-23.50 on Monday. 
 October PJM electricity with similar delivery terms was quoted at $20.00-20.65 from $20.20-20.70 on Monday, while November was pegged in the $21.50-22.00 range from $21.60-21.90 on Monday. 
 December PJM was assessed at $25.00-25.75, while fourth quarter PJM was talked near $22.25-22.75, the sources said.

 USA: IMM currency futures end mixed after FOMC inaction. 
 IMM currency futures end mixed after FOMC inaction. 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 

 IMM currency futures ended pit trading mixed after edging upward when the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee, as expected, left short-term rates steady. 
 Some traders tied the firming, which briefly tugged most currencies to the day's peaks, to "buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact" activities vis-a-vis the dollar. 
 "I'm surprised as well...but there must have been a small amount of insurance (dollar) buying before the meeting," said Chris Turner, currency strategist, IDEA Inc. 
 He said those "just-in-case" long-dollar positions likely were unwound when the Fed took no action.   
 "When the FOMC was over, the dollar went offered," said a floor broker at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. "But when the Redbook hit the street, the dollar rallied." 
 Retail sales rose 1.2 percent in the first two weeks of August versus July, according to Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc Redbook retail sales index. 
 Focus shifted to Wednesday's IFO business climate survey for softness that might bolster arguments for a German cut. 
 But Turner said the currency market likely already had factored in any weakness in the German business survey during last week's dollar rally to 1.4950 from 1.4750 marks.   
 Turner also said his firm did not look for a German ease until the Bundesbank sees more months of evidence that M3 growth has slowed to within its four-percent to seven-percent target corridor. 
 Other pundits, however, said slowing in July M3 growth to an 8.6-percent rate fueled expectations the Bundesbank will cut its 3.30-percent repo rate at Thursday's council meeting. 
 Yen fell early after Japan ministry of finance senior official Eisuke Sakakibara was quoted as saying that even a dollar rise above 110.00 yen would have only a small chance of having an adverse effect on the Japanese economy.   
 Currencies dipped early in the session after a smaller-than-expected June U.S. trade deficit. The trade gap shrank 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion against forecasts for a $9.4-billion shortfall. 
 At settlement, September yen fell $0.000050 to $0.009261, marks eased $0.0004 to $0.6728, Swiss francs firmed $0.0009 to $0.8313, Sterling gained $0.0032 to $1.5476, Canadian dollar slipped $0.0001 to $0.7288, Australian dollar lost $0.0041 to $0.7854, and the Mexican peso rose $0.000350 to $0.131875.
