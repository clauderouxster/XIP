  History of England

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The name England refers to the largest and most populous of the three
main divisions of Great Britain , and dates from
after the coming of the Anglo-Saxons . Technically,
it is anachronistic to talk of a history of England before that time.
This article admits but ignores that anachronism.

The territory of England has been politically united since the tenth
century. This article centers on that territory; but before the tenth
century and after the accession of James VI of Scotland to the throne of
England in 1603 it becomes increasingly hard to distinguish English from
British history.



    Pre-Roman England

Pre-Roman England  may be determined by the
following periods: (NOTE: There is, of course, much debate amongst
experts in the field. The reader should keep in mind that all dates are
approximations.)

     8000-7000 BC Mesolithic  Period begins;
     8000-7000 BC Mesolithic  Period begins;

     2500 BC Neolithic  Period begins;
     1600 BC Bronze Age  begins;
     900 BC Immigration of Celtic -speaking peoples;
 400 BC Early Iron Age ;

Much evidence remains of pre-Roman  England. The Bronze Age
Stonehenge  around the 1500s BC , near
to the much earlier stone circle at Avebury
, is an extremely large although untypical
example. The south of England contains many iron-age hill forts
, surviving as systems of
concentric earthworks, from the huge Maiden Castle 
in Dorset  down to much smaller ones like Grimsbury Castle
 in Berkshire
. Dartmoor National park 
in Devon  displays much evidence of its early inhabitants,
being beset with many hut-circles, stone-rows, kistvaens
 and other visible reminders of the times.


    Roman Britain

The Romans, led by Julius Caesar , landed in
England in 55  and in 54 BC , although not as
conquerors. It was only a century later, in AD  43 ,
under the emperor Claudius  that the Roman occupation of
England  came about. In order to
protect themselves from the depredations of the Picts , the
inhabitants of Scotland  at that time, the Romans under
the emperor Hadrian  had a wall built from east to west,
Hadrian's Wall , to defend England.

In classic Roman style, the Romans constructed a highly effective
internal infrastructure to cement their military occupation, building
long, straight roads the length and breadth of the country, most of
which centred on London . For a deeper account
of the Roman occupation of Britain, see Roman Britain
. See also the Celtic tribes in the British Isles
.

The indigenous, mostly Celtic population were suppressed with customary
Roman efficiency, although numerous, and often extremely bloody,
uprisings occurred all through their occupation, the most notable that
of the Iceni  (and other tribes)
led by Boudicca , or "Boadicea," in AD 61 .
The Roman presence strengthened and weakened over the centuries, but by
the 4th Century AD their hold may best be described as tenuous.


    The Saxon Conquest

In the wake of the Romans, who had largely abandoned the islands by 410
in order to concentrate on more pressing difficulties closer to home,
what is now England was progressively settled by successive, often
complementary, waves of Angles , Saxons ,
Jutes  and Frisians , who had been partly
displaced on mainland Europe . Increasingly the erstwhile
Celtic population was pushed westwards and northwards. The
invasion/settlement of England is known as the Saxon Conquest or the
Anglo-Saxon  (sometimes "English") settlement
(though "settlement" here does not imply an absence of violence).

In the decisive Battle of Deorham , in 577
, the Cornish  Celtic people were separated
from the Welsh  by the advancing Saxons.

Beginning with the raid in 793  on the monastery at
Lindisfarne , Vikings  made many raids
on England. Starting with plundering raids, the Vikings later began to
settle in England and trade. There are many traces of Vikings in England
today, as for instance many words in the English language
; the similarity of Old English
 and Old Norse 
led to much borrowing. One Viking settlement was in York
 (which they called Jorvik ).

It was not until 936 , however, that Athelstan
 was able to evict the Cornish from Exeter
, and drew a line at the extent of his kingdom,
Wessex , at the River Tamar .


    England during the Middle Ages

The defeat of King Harold Godwinson  at the
Battle of Hastings  in 1066  at
the hands of William of Normandy , later styled William
I of England  and the subsequent Norman
 takeover of Saxon England
 led to a sea-change in
the history of the small, isolated, island state. William ordered the
compilation of the Domesday Book , which was a
survey for tax purposes of the entire population and their lands and
property.

The English middle ages  were to be characterised by
civil war, international war, occasional insurrection, and widespread
political intrigue amongst the aristocratic and monarchic elite.

Henry I , also known as Henry Beauclerc (on
account of his education), worked hard to reform and stabilise the
country and smooth the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and Norman
societies. The loss of his son, William, in the wreck of the White Ship
 in November 1120 , was to undermine his
reforms. This problem regarding succession was to cast a long shadow
over English history.

The disastrous and incompetent reign of Stephen
 (1135  - 1154 ) was
to see a major swing in the balance of power towards the feudal barons,
as England descended inexorably into civil war  and
lawlessness. In trying to appease Scottish  and Welsh
raiders on those borders, he handed over large tracts of land. Moreover,
his conflicts with his cousin, the Empress Maud ,
whom he had earlier promised recognition as heir, were his undoing: She
bided her time in France  and, in the autumn of 1139
, invaded (with her husband, Geoffrey of Anjou
 and her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester
).

Stephen was captured, and his government fell. Matilda was proclaimed
queen but was soon at odds with her subjects and was expelled from
London. The period of insurrection and civil war that followed continued
until 1148 , when Matilda returned to France. Stephen
effectively reigned unopposed until his death in 1154 , a
year after reaching an accommodation with Henry of Anjou ,
(who became Henry II ) in which peace between
them was guaranteed on the condition that the throne would be his by
succession.

The reign of Henry II represents a reversion in power back from the
barony to the monarchical state; it was also to see a similar
redistribution of legislative power from the Church, again to the
monarchical state. This period also presaged a properly constituted
legislation and a radical shift away from feudalism.

The Black Death , an epidemic of bubonic plague
that spread over all Europe, arrived in England in 1349  and
killed perhaps up to a third of the population. International excursions
were invariably against domestic neighbours: the Welsh, Irish
, Scots and the French, with the principal notable
battles being the Battle of Crécy  and the Battle
of Agincourt . In addition to this, the final
defeat of the uprising led by the Welsh prince, Owen Glendower
, in 1412  by Prince Henry (later to
become Henry V ) represents the last major
armed attempt by the Welsh to throw off English rule.

Edward III  gifted land to powerful noble
families, including many people with Royal blood in their veins. Because
land was equivelent to power in these days, this meant that these
powerful men could now try and good their claim to the Crown. The
autocratic and arrogant methods of Richard II
 only served to alienate the nobility more,
and his forceful dispossession in 1399 by Henry IV
 lay the seeds for what was to come. In the
reign of Henry VI , which began in 1422,
happenings came to a head because of his personal weaknesses and mental
instability. Unable to control the feuding nobles, he allowed outright
civil war to break out. The conflicts are known as the Wars of the Roses
 and although the fighting was very sporadic
and small, there was a general breakdown in the authority and power of
the Crown. Edward IV  went a little way to
restoring this power but the spadework was generally done by Henry VII



    Tudor England

The Wars of the Roses culminated in the eventual victory of the
relatively unknown Henry Tudor, Henry VII ,
at the Battle of Bosworth Field  in 1485
, where the Yorkist Richard III
 was slain, and the succession of the
Lancastrian House was ultimately assured. Whilst in retrospect it is
easy for us to say that the Wars of the Roses 
were now over, Henry VII could afford no such complacency. Before the
end of his reign, two pretenders would try to wrest the throne from him,
aided by remnants of the Yorkist faction at home and abroad. The first,
Lambert Simnel , was defeated at the Battle of
Stoke  (the last time an English King fought
someone claiming the Crown) and the second, Perkin Warbeck
, was hanged in 1499 after plaguing the King for a
decade.

In 1497 , Michael An Gof
 led Cornish rebels in a
march on London. In a battle over the River Ravensbourne
 at Deptford Bridge
, An
Gof fought for varied issues with their root in taxes. On June 17
, 1497  they were defeated, and Henry VII had
showed he could display military prowess when he needed to. But, like
Charles I  in the future, here was a King
with no wish to go on his travels again. The rest of his reign was
relatively peaceful, despite a slight worry over the succession when his
wife Elizabeth of York  died in 1503.
