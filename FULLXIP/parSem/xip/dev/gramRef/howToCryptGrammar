This small notes gives some information to compute the grammar key to limite the 
 grammar usage for a period of time and to crypt the grammar files.

You have to do the following steps in this order:

1) edit the grammar file usually named english.xip for english grammar or italian.xip for italian grammar. 
	- This file is specified in the grm file:
		grammar:
		$GRM_PATHNAME/italian.xip  

	- in this grammar file, modify the "License and Expiration" fields:
		License: Xerox
		Modules: chunker, inference, extraction, semantic, server
		Expiration: 2010/11/31

2) compute the key
	goto the directory where the grammar file is located, and run the "keyGen" application
	keyGen italian.xip
	It creates and displays the new key.
	You can found the keyGen tool in .../xip-xx.yy/keyGenTool/bin/windows or 
	.../xip-xx.yy/keyGenTool/bin/linux

3) re-edit the grammar file (italian.xip) and change the value of "Code" field by the
	new key value generated using the "keyGen" application.

4) to crypt grammar files you have to use "xip" application with "-crypte" option.
	mkdir xx
	xip -crypte xx -grm italian.grm

5) edit the grm file and change "grammar:" by "gram:"

6) edit all files where some file hierachie could be specified(grm, ntmscript files) and 
	remove this file hierachie: all the crypted files are now in only one directory.

7) to rename *.xip.crypte in *.xip you may use the following shell script:
	cd xx
	ls -1 *.crypte | gawk 'BEGIN{FS="."}{print "mv " $0, $1"."$2;}' | sh

8) note 1: the grammar files declared using the "parameter:" field are not crypted and you have add
	them manualy in the xx directory

9) note 2: The python script must not be crypted. 
	To avoid the crypting of a file, you have to modify the language.xip file: 
	add an "@" char after the "+" for each python script file name. 
	 +$DEPENDENCIES/dependency7.xip, +$DEPENDENCIES/dependency8.xip, +@pythonScript.py
