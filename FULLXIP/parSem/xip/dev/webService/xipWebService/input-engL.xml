VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, worlda93.txt

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year we will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

We need your donations more than ever!

All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/IBC", and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law ("IBC" is Illinois
Benedictine College).  (Subscriptions to our paper newsletter go

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Illinois Benedictine College (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMTED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"

*END*THE SMALL PRINT! FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS*Ver.04.29.93*END*

This is a preliminary edition.  The final first edition should be on
file around midnight, October 31, 1993.

As usual, the margination in these reports may be rough, and another
edition should appear, somewhat neater in appearance, as a Gutenberg
volunteer will probably start work on this shortly.

This file has been edited in such a manner as to delete redundancies
[some, not all] and extra spaces [some, not all], enough that a file
from Project Gutenberg should be enough smaller that storarge/search
requirements should be reduced by 15 to 20%.

There have been some significant changes in this edition. Czechoslovakia has
been superseded by the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Eritrea gained independence
from Ethiopia. The name of the Ivory Coast has been changed to Cote d'Ivoire and
the Vatican City became the Holy See. New entries include Location, Map
references, Abbreviation (often substituted for the country name), and Digraph
(two-letter country code). Names is a new entry which includes long and short
forms of both conventional and local names of countries as well as any former
names. Most diacritical marks have been omitted. The electronic files used to
produce the Factbook have been restructured into a database. As a result, the
formats of some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes
will occur in the 1994 Factbook. Irrigated land is a new entry with the data
separate from the Land use entry. The Disputes entry is now International
disputes. The GNP/GDP entry was renamed National Product and the per capita and
real growth rate data placed in separate entries. Similar changes were made in
the Population and Diplomatic Representation entries.

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and first-order
administrative divisions are generally those approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by
BGN are noted.

Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding
inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas are based on
total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of
the 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 km2,
69 miles 2) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2, 0.23 miles 2,146 acres).

Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000
population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.

Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1993 was
used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates for 1
July 1993, with population growth rates estimated for calendar year 1993. Major
political events have been updated through June 1993.

Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000
population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.

Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter "country code'' that precisely identifies
every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the
digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized geopolitical data element
promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS)
10-3 by the National Bureau of Standards (US Department of Commerce) and
maintained by the Office of the Geographer (US Department of State). The digraph
is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection,
processing, and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful
for interchanging data between databases.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with 180
nations. The US has diplomatic relations with 174 of the 182 UN members
(excluding the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia whose status in the UN
is unclear)--the exceptions are Angola, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Macedonia,
North Korea, and Vietnam. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 7
nations that are not in the UN-Andorra, Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland,
Tonga, and Tuvalu.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development
assistance (ODA), which is defined as government grants that are administered
with the promotion of economic development and welfare of LDCs as their main
objective and are concessional in character and contain a grant element of at
least 25%, and other official flows (OOF) or transactions by the official sector
whose main objective is other than development motivated or whose grant element
is below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF transactions include official export
credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment,
and debt reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional
terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are initialed by
the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration of intent.

Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others are
not officially recognized by the US Government. "Nation'' refers to a people
politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
"Dependent area" refers to a broad category of political entities that are
associated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually
the short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are
266 entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Exchange rate: The value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over a
given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US dollar and
as determined by international market forces or official fiat.

Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and services produced
domestically in a given year.

Gross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and services produced
domestically in a given year, plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by
foreigners from domestic production.

Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and services
produced worldwide in a given year.

GNP/GDP methodology: In the "Economy'' section, GNP/GDP dollar estimates for the
OECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European countries are
derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from
conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method normally
involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are applied to the
quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In addition to the
lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician faces a
major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the quality of
goods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate in dollars by the
corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP conversion rate. One
thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one
thousand dollars--converted to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate--
will buy in the other country. GNP/GDP estimates for the LDCs, on the other
hand, are based on the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in local currencies to
dollars at the official currency exchange rates. Because currency exchange rates
depend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often
have little relation to domestic output, use of these rates is less satisfactory
for calculating GNP/GDP than the PPP method. Furthermore, exchange rates may
suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat
whereas real output has remained unchanged. One additional caution: the
proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local
currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP
accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer estimates
the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures; similar problems
exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency exchange rate
procedures. Finally, as academic research moves forward on the PPP method, we
hope to convert all GNP/GDP estimates to this method in future editions of The
World Factbook.

Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population, resulting
from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants
entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative.

Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs--narcotics,
stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These
categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well
as those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.

Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,
Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish
(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).

Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant
cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and
is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.

Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.

Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include
chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),
benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide
(Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).

Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, or
behavioral change in an individual.

Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in
physical,
mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.

Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and
emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,
buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,
angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others
(psilocybin, psilocyn).

Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).

Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.

Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).

Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium,
opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium
(paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol
w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic
narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic
narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone
(Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).

Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy.

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.

Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium
poppy.

Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis that is
chewed or drunk as tea.

Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and activity,
and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine),
phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,
Sanorex, Tenuate).

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in a
given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.

International disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that
range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one
sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international boundaries
and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the Department of State. References
to other situations may also be included that are border or frontier relevant,
such as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.
However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or
recognition by the US Government.

Irrigated land: The figure refers to the number of km 2 that is artifically
supplied with water.

Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land--land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize, rice);
permanent crops--land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each
harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently used
for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland land--under dense or open
stands of trees; and other--any land type not specifically mentioned above
(urban areas, roads, desert).

Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents
the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not involved with the day-
to-day activities of the government. The head of government is the
administrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the government.
In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime Minister is the head
of government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and the head
of government.

Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group of
people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in
the future.

Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless
otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition--the ability
to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual
countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of
this publication.

Maps: All maps will be available only in the printed version of The World
Factbook for the foreseeable future.

Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national
claims from being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial
vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing
vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by
nationality or register.

Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or
colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent
country; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an
internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the
parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime
laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a
captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad.
The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it
is not the register of an independent state.

Flag of convenience register--A national register offering registration to a
merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC)
attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent
taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are
characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in
the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the
merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.

Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal
jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Differences
in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and
whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.

Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national
register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that
nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on
the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of
profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag
state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship
Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of
an internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the
national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to
the Norwegian and Danish flags.

Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; commonly
used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial
vessels only.

Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the
maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual
ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and
makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state)
regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless otherwise
indicated.

National product: The total output of goods and services in a country in a given
year. See Gross domestic product (GDP), Gross national product (GNP), and
GNP/GDP methodology.

Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and
leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear
population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net
immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).

Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on
statistics from population censuses, vital registration systems, or sample
surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future trends.

Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per
woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore
children according to a given fertility rate at each age.

Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as
fiscal year (FY).

*Afghanistan, Economy

Overview:
  Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
  dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and
  goats). Economic considerations have played second fiddle to political and
  military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including the nearly
  10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). Over the
  past decade, one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan
  sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. Another
  1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan.
  Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product is lower than
  12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of
  trade and transport.

*Albania, Economy

Overview:
  The Albanian economy, already providing the lowest standard of living in
  Europe, contracted sharply in 1991, with most industries producing at only a
  fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at 40%. For over
  40 years, the Stalinist-type economy operated on the principle of central
  planning and state ownership of the means of production. Fitful economic
  reforms begun during 1991, including the liberalization of prices and trade,
  the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform, were crippled by
  widespread civil disorder. Following its overwhelming victory in the 22
  March 1992 elections, the new Democratic government announced a program of
  shock therapy to stabilize the economy and establish a market economy. In an
  effort to expand international ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic
  relations with the major republics of the former Soviet Union and the US and
  has joined the IMF and the World Bank. The Albanians have also passed
  legislation allowing foreign investment, but not foreign ownership of real
  estate. Albania possesses considerable mineral resources and, until 1990,
  was largely self-sufficient in food; however, the breakup of cooperative
  farms in 1991 and general economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign
  aid to maintain adequate supplies. In 1992 the government tightened
  budgetary contols leading to another drop in domestic output. The
  agricultural sector is steadily gaining from the privatization process. Low
  domestic output is supplemented by remittances from the 200,000 Albanians
  working abroad.

*Algeria, Economy

Overview:
  The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy,
  hydrocarbons accounting for nearly all export receipts, about 30% of
  government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in
  oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
  program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the
  mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the
  nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since full
  independence in 1988. The current government has put reform, including
  privatization of some public sector companies and an overhaul of the banking
  and financial system, on hold, but has continued efforts to admit private
  enterprise to the hydrocarbon industry.

*Andorra, Economy

Overview:
  The mainstay of Andorra's economy is tourism. An estimated 13 million
  tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its
  summer and winter resorts. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status,
  also contributes significantly to the economy. Agricultural production is
  limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The
  principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly
  of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Although it is a member of the EC
  customs union, it is unclear what effect the European Single Market will
  have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free status.

*Angola, Economy

Overview:
  Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80-90% of the
  population, but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital
  to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Bitter internal fighting
  continues to severely affect the nonoil economy, and food needs to be
  imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
  resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To
  realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
  but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
  imbalances throughout the economy.

International disputes:
  Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty Summary below);
  sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France
  (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and
  UK; the US and most other nations do not recognize the territorial claims of
  other nations and have made no claims themselves (the US and Russia reserve
  the right to do so); no formal claims have been made in the sector between
  90 degrees west and 150 degrees west, where, because of floating ice,
  Antarctica is unapproachable from the sea
Climate:
  severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the
  ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher
  elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher
  temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below
  freezing
Terrain:
  about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average
  elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897
  meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land,
  Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on
  McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline,
  and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent
Natural resources:

*Antarctica, Geography

Environment:

  the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; a
  circumpolar ocean current flows clockwise along the coast as do cyclonic
  storms that form over the ocean; during summer more solar radiation reaches
  the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
  equivalent period; in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
  which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had
  dwindled to the lowest level ever recorded over Antarctica; active volcanism
  on Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic
  activity rare and weak

  Currently, there are 41 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 15
  acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim
  portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and 19
  nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made no claims
  have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize the claims of
  others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was voted
  to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates the country
  was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are--Argentina,
  Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant
  consultative nations are--Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador
  (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan,
  South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South
  Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia.
  Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses,
  are--Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988), Cuba
  (1984), Czechoslovakia (1962), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987), Guatemala
  (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania
  (1971), Switzerland (1990), and Ukraine (1992).

  treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that
  are contrary to the treaty
 Article 11:
  disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately,
  by the ICJ
 Article 12, 13, 14:

 Other agreements:
  more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings and
  ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for the Conservation of
  Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of
  Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
  Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988
  but was subsequently rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental
  Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification; this
  agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through
  five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental
  impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas; it also prohibits
  all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific research;
  four parties have ratified Protocol as of June 1993
Legal system:
  US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such
  as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries.
  Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic
  Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and
  criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by
  regulation of statute: The taking of native mammals or birds; the
  introduction of nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially
  protected or scientific areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and
  the importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of
  the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
  and 1 year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Transportation,
  and Interior share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US
  Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to
  Antarctica to notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs,
  Room 5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such
  plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more
  information contact Permit Office, Office of Polar Programs, National
  Science Foundation, Washington, DC 20550.

*Antigua and Barbuda, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most important
  determinant of economic performance. During the period 1987-90, real GDP
  expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct
  contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors -
  particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although
  Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a
  labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it has been hurt in 1991-92
  by a downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US
  recession.

*Argentina, Economy

Overview:
  Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population,
  an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
  Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
  economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge external debts and recurring
  bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession,
  President MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring
  program that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable,
  sustainable growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US
  dollar since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20

*Armenia, Economy

Overview:
  Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile,
  machine-building, and other industries and had become a key supplier to
  sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
  and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the
  republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has
  been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
  Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave
  within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright
  warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
  Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleaguered
  Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed
  about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has
  not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
  disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
  USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the
  earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40% of
  Armenia's needs for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of
  the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of
  nonferrous metal ores (bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum) that are
  largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects seem
  particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high
  dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of
  transformation. The dramatic drop in output in 1992 is attributable largely
  to the cumulative impact of the blockade; of particular importance was the
  shutting off in the summer of 1992 of rail and road links to Russia through
  Georgia due to civil strife in the latter republic.

*Aruba, Economy

Overview:
  Tourism is the mainstay of the economy, although offshore banking and oil
  refining and storage are also important. Hotel capacity expanded rapidly
  between 1985 and 1989 and nearly doubled in 1990 alone. Unemployment has
  steadily declined from about 20% in 1986 to about 3% in 1991. The reopening
  of the local oil refinery, once a major source of employment and foreign
  exchange earnings, promises to give the economy an additional boost.

*Australia, Economy

Overview:
  Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per
  capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries.
  Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
  products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Of the top 25 exports, 21 are
  primary products, so that, as happened during 1983-84, a downturn in world
  commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is
  pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
  international markets continues to be severe.

*Austria, Economy

Overview:
  Austria boasts a prosperous and stable socialist market economy with a
  sizable proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits.
  Thanks to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor
  force, and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies
  specialized niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and
  produces almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force
  in agriculture. Increased export sales resulting from German unification,
  continued to boost Austria's economy through 1991. However, Germany's
  economic difficulties in 1992 slowed Austria's GDP growth to 2% from the 3%
  of 1991. Austria's economy, moreover, is not expected to grow by more than
  1% in 1993, and inflation is forecast to remain about 4%. Unemployment will
  likely remain at current levels at least until 1994. Living standards in
  Austria are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western
  Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level
  of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
  capabilities. The continued opening of Eastern European markets, however,
  will increase demand for Austrian exports. Austria, a member of the European
  Free Trade Association (EFTA), in 1992 ratified the European Economic Area
  Treaty, which will extend European Community rules on the free movement of
  people, goods, capital and services to the EFTA countries, and Austrians
  plan to hold a national referendum within the next two years to vote on EC
  membership.

*Azerbaijan, Economy

Overview:
  Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
  the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
  its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low
  standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are cotton, oil,
  and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
  for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate
  the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,
  marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Muslim
  Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
  accounted for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former
  Soviet Union. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet
  republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy, but
  its considerable energy resources brighten its propects somewhat. Old
  economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced. A particularly galling
  constraint on economic revival is the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, said to
  consume 25% of Azerbaijan's economic resources.

*Bahrain, Economy

*Bangladesh, Economy

Overview:
  Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least
  developed nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural. Major
  impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, government
  interference with the economy, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be
  absorbed by agriculture, a low level of industrialization, failure to fully
  exploit energy resources (natural gas), and inefficient and inadequate power
  supplies. An excellent rice crop and expansion of the export garment
  industry helped growth in FY91/92. Policy reforms intended to reduce
  government regulation of private industry and promote public-sector
  efficiency have been announced but are being implemented only slowly.

*Barbados, Economy

Overview:
  A per capita income of $7,000 gives Barbados one of the highest standards of
  living of all the small island states of the eastern Caribbean.
  Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and
  related activities. In recent years, however, the economy has diversified
  into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer
  of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy
  slowed in 1990-91, however, and Bridgetown's declining hard currency
  reserves and inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an
  austere economic reform program.

*Belarus, Economy

Overview:
  In many ways Belarus resembles the three Baltic states, for example, in its
  industrial competence, its higher-than-average standard of living, and its
  critical dependence on the other former Soviet states for fuels and raw
  materials. Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet
  republics, having produced 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor
  force in the old USSR. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies
  important producer and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to
  the other states. Belarus had a significant share of the machine-building
  capacity of the former USSR. It is especially noted for production of
  tractors, large trucks, machine tools, and automation equipment. The soil in
  Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by emphasizing
  favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens), Belarus has
  become a net exporter to the other former republics of meat, milk, eggs,
  flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and gas and
  receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil pipeline and
  the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit Belarus en route
  to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals, plastics, synthetic
  fibers (nearly 30% of former Soviet output), and fertilizer (20% of former
  Soviet output). Raw material resources are limited to potash and peat
  deposits. The peat (more than one-third of the total for the former Soviet
  Union) is used in domestic heating, as boiler fuel for electric power
  stations, and in the production of chemicals. The potash supports fertilizer
  production. In 1992 GDP fell an estimated 13%, largely because the country
  is highly dependent on the ailing Russian economy for raw materials and
  parts.

*Belgium, Economy

Overview:
  This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central
  geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified
  industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the
  populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging
  reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources
  Belgium must import essential raw materials, making its economy closely
  dependent on the state of world markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC
  countries. The economy grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90,
  but economic growth slowed to a 1% pace in 1991-92. The economy is expected
  to turn in another sluggish 1% performance in 1993. Belgium's public debt
  remains high at 120% of GDP and the government is trying to control its
  expenditures to bring the figure more into line with other industrialized
  countries.

  generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings. The industrial sector
  contributes only about 15% to GDP and employs 2% of the work force. Low
  prices in recent years have kept down hard currency earnings from Benin's
  major exports of agricultural products and crude oil.

*Bhutan, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on agriculture and
  forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of the population and
  account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make
  the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The
  economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and
  monetary links. The industrial sector is small and technologically backward,
  with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development
  projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
  hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are its most important
  natural resources; however, the government limits the number of tourists to
  3,000/year to minimize foreign influence.

*Bolivia, Economy

Overview:
  With its long history of semifeudalistic social controls, dependence on
  volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of hyperinflation,
  Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least developed Latin American
  countries. Since August 1989, President PAZ Zamora, despite his Marxist
  origins, has maintained a moderate policy of repressing domestic terrorism,
  containing inflation, and achieving annual GDP growth of 3 to 4%. For many
  farmers, who constitute half of the country's work force, the main cash crop
  is coca, which is sold for cocaine processing.

*Bosnia and Herzegovina, Header

Note:
  Bosnia and Herzegovina is suffering from interethnic civil strife which
  began in March 1992 after the Bosnian Government held a referendum on
  independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia - responded
  with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines
  and joining Serb held areas to a "greater Serbia". Since the onset of the
  conflict, which has driven approximately half of the pre-war population of
  4.4 million from their homes, both the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Croats
  have asserted control of more than three-quarters of the territory formerly
  under the control of the Bosnian Government. The UN and the EC are
  continuing to try to mediate a plan for peace.

*Bosnia and Herzegovina, Economy

Overview:
  Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest republic in
  the old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
  private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic
  traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
  overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning
  and management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
  the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
  Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of March 1993, Bosnia and Herzegovina was
  being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic warfare that has caused
  production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery
  to multiply. No reliable economic statistics for 1992 are available,
  although output clearly fell below the already depressed 1991 level.

*Botswana, Economy

Overview:
  The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops.
  Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population,
  but produces only about 50% of food needs. The driving force behind the
  rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry.
  This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating
  25% of GDP in 1980 to 50% in 1991. No other sector has experienced such
  growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
  poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond
  production was down slightly in 1992, substantial gains in coal output and
  manufacturing helped boost the economy

*Brazil, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors, entered
  the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an unserviceable
  foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy direction. In addition,
  the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and protected by
  substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and
  mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several
  multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are
  private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts
  between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
  violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed office in March 1990,
  launched an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and
  reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,
  and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government also
  obtained an IMF standby loan in January 1992 and reached agreements with
  commercial bankers on the repayment of interest arrears and on the reduction
  of debt and debt service payments. Galloping inflation - the rate doubled in
  1992 - continues to undermine economic stability. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed
  the presidency following President COLLOR'S resignation in December 1992,
  has promised to support the basic premises of COLLOR'S reform program but
  has yet to define clearly his economic policies. Brazil's natural resources
  remain a major, long-term economic strength.

*British Virgin Islands, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is highly
  dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21% of the national
  income. In 1985 the government offered offshore registration to companies
  wishing to incorporate in the islands, and, in consequence, incorporation
  fees generated about $2 million in 1987. The economy slowed in 1991 because
  of the poor performances of the tourist sector and tight commercial bank
  credit. Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural activity. The
  islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food requirements.

*Bulgaria, Economy

Overview:
  Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the 2% annual level in
  the 1980s. By 1990, Sofia's foreign debt had skyrocketed to over $10 billion
  - giving a debt-service ratio of more than 40% of hard currency earnings and
  leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments.
  The post-Communist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
  industrial plant; keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological
  developments; investing in additional energy capacity (the portion of
  electric power from nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and
  motivating workers, in part by giving them a share in the earnings of their
  enterprises. Political bickering in Sofia and the collapse of the DIMITROV
  government in October 1992 have slowed the economic reform process. New
  Prime Minister BEROV, however, has pledged to continue the reforms initiated
  by the previous government. He has promised to continue cooperation with the
  World Bank and IMF, advance negotiations on rescheduling commercial debt,
  and push ahead with privatization. BEROV's government - whose main
  parliamentary supporters are the former Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party
  (BSP) - nonetheless appears likely to pursue more interventionist tactics in
  overcoming the country's economic problems.

  density, few natural resources, and relatively infertile soil. Economic
  development is hindered by a poor communications network within a landlocked
  country. Agriculture provides about 40% of GDP and is entirely of a
  subsistence nature. Industry, dominated by unprofitable
  government-controlled corporations, accounts for about 15% of GDP.

*Burma, Economy

Overview:
  Burma is a poor Asian country, with a per capita GDP of about $660. The
  nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
  earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports.
  For rice, traditionally the most important export, the drop in world prices
  has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In
  1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
  position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which
  generates about 40% of GDP and provides employment for 65% of the work
  force. Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
  and has been trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with little
  success.

*Burundi, Economy

Overview:
  A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic
  development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
  industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts
  for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to
  pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
  climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform
  agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi
  is trying to diversify its agricultural exports and attract foreign
  investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee companies were privatized
  via public auction in September 1991.

*Cambodia, Economy

Overview:
  Cambodia remains a desperately poor country whose economic recovery is held
  hostage to continued political unrest and factional hostilities. The
  country's immediate economic challenge is an acute financial crisis that is
  undermining monetary stability and preventing disbursement of foreign
  development assistance. Cambodia is still recovering from an abrupt shift in
  1990 to free-market economic mechanisms and a cutoff in aid from former
  Soviet bloc countries; these changes have severely impacted on public sector
  revenues and performance. The country's infrastructure of roads, bridges,
  and power plants has been severely degraded, now having only 40-50% of
  prewar capacity. The economy remains essentially rural, with 90% of the
  population living in the countryside and dependent mainly on subsistence
  agriculture. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and
  unreliable.

*Cameroon, Economy

Overview:
  Because of its offshore oil resources, Cameroon has one of the highest
  incomes per capita in tropical Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
  problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political
  instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate
  for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid
  economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986
  precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee,
  cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and
  inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-92, with support
  from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms
  designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture,
  and recapitalize the nation's banks. Nationwide strikes organized by
  opposition parties in 1991, however, undermined these efforts.

*Canada, Economy

Overview:
  As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
  the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and pattern of
  production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
  mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
  economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada
  registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,
  averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
  and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. However,
  the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking
  areas has observers discussing a possible split in the confederation; foregn
  investors have become edgy.

*Cape Verde, Economy

Overview:
  Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
  serious, long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service
  oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 60%
  of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas,
  agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts for 4%.
  About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster
  and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of
  GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances
  from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the new
  democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the private
  sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

*Central African Republic, Economy

Overview:
  Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of the CAR
  economy, with more than 70% of the population living in the countryside. In
  1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40% of GDP. Agricultural
  products accounted for about 60% of export earnings and the diamond industry
  for 30%. Important constraints to economic development include the CAR's
  landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a weak human resource
  base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance, particularly from
  France, plays a major role in providing capital for new investment.

*Chad, Economy

Overview:
  The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and natural
  resources make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in the world.
  Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict with Libya,
  drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its 1977 level,
  with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports. Over 80% of
  the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing. Industry is
  based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural products, including
  cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, with
  its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from shortages. Oil
  companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the Doba basin in
  the south. Good crop weather led to 8.4% growth in 1991.

*Chile, Economy

Overview:
  The government of President AYLWIN, which took power in 1990, retained the
  economic policies of PINOCHET, although the share of spending for social
  welfare has risen steadily. In 1991 growth in GDP recovered to 6% (led by
  consumer spending) after only 2% growth in 1990. The pace accelerated in
  1992 as the result of strong investment and export growth, and GDP rose
  10.4%. Nonetheless, inflation fell further, to 12.7%, compared with 27.3% in
  1990 and 18.7% in 1991. The buoyant economy spurred a 25% growth in imports,
  and the trade surplus fell in 1992, although international reserves
  increased. Inflationary pressures are not expected to ease much in 1993, and
  economic growth is likely to approach 7%.

*China, Economy

Overview:
  Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move the
  economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a more
  productive and flexible economy with market elements, but still within the
  framework of monolithic Communist control. To this end the authorities have
  switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of
  the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and
  plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale
  enterprise in services and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign
  economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying
  result has been a strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in
  the early 1980s. Industry also has posted major gains, especially in coastal
  areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and
  modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
  export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the
  darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the
  worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of
  capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has
  periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals and
  thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process. In 1991, and again
  in 1992, output rose substantially, particularly in the favored coastal
  areas. Popular resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority
  by rural cadres have weakened China's population control program, which is
  essential to the nation's long-term economic viability.

  December 1987 the Australian Government closed the mine as no longer
  economically viable. Plans have been under way to reopen the mine and also
  to build a casino and hotel to develop tourism, with a possible opening date
  during the first half of 1992.

*Colombia, Economy

Overview:
  Economic development has slowed gradually since 1986, but growth rates
  remain high by Latin American standards. Conservative economic policies have
  kept inflation and unemployment near 30% and 10%, respectively. The rapid
  development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries in recent
  years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices - Colombia's major
  export. The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the summer of
  1989, a troublesome rural insurgency, energy rationing, and drug-related
  violence have dampened growth. The level of violence, in Bogota in
  particular, surged to higher levels in the first quarter of 1993, further
  delaying the economic resurgence expected from government reforms. These
  reforms center on fiscal restraint, trade and investment liberalization,
  financial and labor reform, and privatization of state utilities and
  commercial banks.

*Comoros, Economy

Overview:
  One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of several islands
  that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing
  population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the
  labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high
  unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical
  assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the
  leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the
  labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not
  self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for
  90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an
  annual average rate of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was only 5% in
  1988. Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for
  about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of
  1.5% during 1985-90 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and
  balance-of-payments difficulties. Preliminary estimates for FY92 show a
  moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports, tourism,
  and government investment outlays.

*Congo, Economy

Overview:
  Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, a
  beginning industrial sector based largely on oil, supporting services, and a
  government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform
  program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in
  1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
  a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
  of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and
  exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
  finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually,
  one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however,
  growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5% annually, only half the
  population growth rate. The new government, responding to pressure from
  businessmen and the electorate, has promised to reduce the bureaucracy and
  government regulation but little has been accomplished as of early 1993.

*Cook Islands, Economy

Overview:
  Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are fruit,
  copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
  fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development
  is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
  of natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is
  annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid.
  Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
  and expanding the fishing industry.

*Costa Rica, Economy

Overview:
  In 1992 the economy grew at an estimated 5.4%, up from the 2.5% gain of 1991
  and the gain of 1990. Increases in agricultural production (on the strength
  of good coffee and banana crops) and in nontraditional exports are
  responsible for much of the growth. In 1992 consumer prices rose by 17%,
  below the 27% of 1991. The trade deficit of $100 million was substantially
  below the 1991 deficit of $270 million. Unemployment is officially reported
  at 4.0%, but much underemployment remains. External debt, on a per capita
  basis, is among the world's highest.

*Cote d'Ivoire, Economy

Overview:
  Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and exporters of
  coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is
  highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and
  cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to
  diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related
  industries. The agricultural sector accounts for over one-third of GDP and
  about 80% of export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor force. A
  collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a
  recession, from which the country had not recovered by 1990. Continuing low
  prices for commodity exports, an overvalued exchange rate, a bloated
  public-sector wage bill, and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery
  in 1991. The government, which has sponsored various economic reform
  programs, especially in agriculture, projected an increase of 1.6% in GNP in
  1992.

*Croatia, Economy

Overview:
  Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia, after
  Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per capita
  output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps one-third above
  the Yugoslav average. Croatian Serb Nationalists control approximately one
  third of the Croatian territory, and one of the overriding determinants of
  Croatia's long-term political and economic prospects will be the resolution
  of this territorial dispute. Croatia faces monumental problems stemming
  from: the legacy of longtime Communist mismanagement of the economy; large
  foreign debt; damage during the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines,
  buildings, and houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and
  Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former
  Yugoslav republics, as well as within its own territory. At the minimum,
  extensive Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil
  industries, would seem necessary to salvage a desperate economic situation.
  However, peace and political stability must come first. As of June 1993,
  fighting continues among Croats, Serbs, and Muslims, and national boundaries
  and final political arrangements are still in doubt.

*Croatia, Economy

Agriculture:
  Croatia normally produces a food surplus; most agricultural land in private
  hands and concentrated in Croat-majority districts in Slavonia and Istria;
  much of Slavonia's land has been put out of production by fighting; wheat,
  corn, sugar beets, sunflowers, alfalfa, and clover are main crops in
  Slavonia; central Croatian highlands are less fertile but support cereal
  production, orchards, vineyards, livestock breeding, and dairy farming;
  coastal areas and offshore islands grow olives, citrus fruits, and
  vegetables

*Cuba, Economy

Overview:
  Since Castro's takeover of Cuba in 1959, the economy has been run in the
  Soviet style of government ownership of substantially all the means of
  production and government planning of all but the smallest details of
  economic activity. Thus, Cuba, like the former Warsaw Pact nations, has
  remained in the backwater of economic modernization. The economy contracted
  by about one-third between 1989 and 1992 as it absorbed the loss of $4
  billion of annual economic aid from the former Soviet Union and much smaller
  amounts from Eastern Europe. The government implemented numerous energy
  conservation measures and import substitution schemes to cope with a large
  decline in imports. To reduce fuel consumption, Havana has cut back bus
  service and imported approximately 1 million bicycles from China,
  domesticated nearly 200,000 oxen to replace tractors, and halted a large
  amount of industrial production. The government has prioritized domestic
  food production and promoted herbal medicines since 1990 to compensate for
  lower imports. Havana also has been shifting its trade away from the former
  Soviet republics and Eastern Europe toward the industrialized countries of
  Latin America and the OECD.

*Cyprus, Economy

Overview:
  The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
  contributes 16.5% to GDP and employs 29% of the labor force, while the
  service sector contributes 62% to GDP and employs 57% of the labor force.
  Rapid growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in
  tourism have played important roles in the average 6.8% rise in GDP between
  1986 and 1990. This progress was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the
  adverse effects of the Gulf War on tourism. Nevertheless in mid-1991, the
  World Bank "graduated" Cyprus off its list of developing countries. In
  contrast to the bright picture in the south, the Turkish Cypriot economy has
  less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a series of reverses in 1991.
  Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the collapse of the
  fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a drought, the
  Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibillion-dollar grant from Turkey
  to help ease the burden of the economic crisis. In addition, the Turkish
  government extended a $100 million loan in November 1992 to be used for
  economic development projects in 1993. Turkey normally underwrites a
  substantial portion of the Turkish Cypriot economy.

*Czech Republic, Economy

Overview:
  The dissolution of Czechoslovakia into two independent nation states - the
  Czech Republic and Slovakia - on 1 January 1993 has complicated the task of
  moving toward a more open and decentralized economy. The old Czechoslovakia,
  even though highly industrialized by East European standards, suffered from
  an aging capital plant, lagging technology, and a deficiency in energy and
  many raw materials. In January 1991, approximately one year after the end of
  communist control of Eastern Europe, theCzech and Slovak Federal Republic
  launched a sweeping program to convert its almost entirely state-owned and
  controlled economy to a market system. In 1991-92 these measures resulted in
  privatization of some medium- and small-scale economic activity and the
  setting of more than 90% of prices by the market - but at a cost in
  inflation, unemployment, and lower output. For Czechoslovakia as a whole
  inflation in 1991 was roughly 50% and output fell 15%. In 1992, in the Czech
  lands, inflation dropped to an estimated 12.5% and GDP was down a more
  moderate 5%. For 1993 the government of the Czech Republic anticipates
  inflation of 15-20% and a rise in unemployment to perhaps 12% as some
  large-scale enterprises go into bankruptcy; GDP may drop as much as 3%,
  mainly because of the disruption of trade links with Slovakia. Although the
  governments of the Czech Republic and Slovakia had envisaged retaining the
  koruna as a common currency, at least in the short term, the two countries
  ended the currency union in February 1993.

*Denmark, Economy

Overview:
  This modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale
  and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable
  living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark's new
  center-left coalition government will concentrate on reducing the persistent
  high unemployment rate and the budget deficit as well as following the
  previous government's policies of maintaining low inflation and a current
  account surplus. In the face of recent international market pressure on the
  Danish krone, the coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency.
  The coalition hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall
  tax revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax
  reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve welfare
  services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Prime Minister
  RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to EC's economic and
  monetary union (EMU) criteria by 1999, although Copenhagen won from the EC
  the right to opt out of the EMU if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark
  is, in fact, one of the few EC countries likely to fit into the EMU on time.
  Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than many West
  European countries. As the EC's single market (formally established on 1
  January 1993) gets underway, Danish economic growth is expected to pickup to
  around 2% in 1993. Expected Danish approval of the Maastricht treaty on EC
  political and economic union in May 1993 would almost certainly reverse the
  drop in investment, further boosting growth. The current account surplus
  remains strong as limitations on wage increases and low inflation - expected
  to be around 1% in 1993 - improve export competitiveness. Although
  unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European countries.

*Djibouti, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is based on service activities connected with the country's
  strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa.
  Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
  international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural
  resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
  on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
  development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a
  major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last
  five years because of recession and a high population growth rate (including
  immigrants and refugees).
National product:
  GDP - exchange rate conversion - $358 million (1990 est.)
National product real growth rate:
  1.2% (1990 est.)
National product per capita:
  $1,030 (1990 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
  7.7% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
  over 30% (1989)
Budget:
  revenues $170 million; expenditures $203 million, including capital
  expenditures of $70 million (1991 est.)
Exports:

 partners:
  Western Europe 54%, Middle East 20%, Asia 19%
External debt:
  $355 million (December 1990)
Industrial production:
  growth rate 10.0% (1990); manufacturing accounts for 11% of GDP
Electricity:
  115,000 kW capacity; 200 million kWh produced, 580 kWh per capita (1991)
Industries:
  limited to a few small-scale enterprises, such as dairy products and
  mineral-water bottling
Agriculture:
  accounts for only 3% of GDP; scanty rainfall limits crop production to
  mostly fruit and vegetables; half of population pastoral nomads herding
  goats, sheep, and camels; imports bulk of food needs
Economic aid:
  US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY78-89), $39 million; Western (non-US)
  countries, including ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $1.1
  billion; OPEC bilateral aid (1979-89), $149 million; Communist countries

*Dominican Republic, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is largely dependent on trade; imported components average 60%
  of the value of goods consumed in the domestic market. Rapid growth of free
  trade zones has established a significant expansion of manufacturing for
  export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, tourism has also
  increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a
  source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The
  principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa,
  and tobacco. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
  products, oil refining, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is officially
  reported at about 30%, but there is considerable underemployment.

*Ecuador, Economy

Overview:
  Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas. Growth
  has been uneven because of natural disasters, fluctuations in global oil
  prices, and government policies designed to curb inflation. Banana exports,
  second only to oil, have suffered as a result of EC import quotas and banana
  blight. The new President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN, has a much more favorable
  attitude toward foreign investment than did his predecessor. Ecuador has
  implemented trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Venezuela and
  has applied for GATT membership. At the end of 1991, Ecuador received a
  standby IMF loan of $105 million, which will permit the country to proceed
  with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt. In September 1992, the government
  launched a new, macroeconomic program that gives more play to market forces;
  as of March 1993, the program seemed to be paying off.

*Egypt, Economy

Overview:
  Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
  economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
  Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.
  Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but
  in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
  debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
  balance-of-payments support. Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement concluded
  in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the government's failure
  to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed a follow-on program with the IMF and
  also negotiated a structural adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In
  1991-92 the government made solid progress on administrative reforms such as
  liberalizing exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major
  structural reforms like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the
  economy has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing
  problem. In 1992-93 tourism has plunged 20% or so because of sporadic
  attacks by Islamic extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited
  population growth as the main cause of the country's economic troubles. The
  addition of about 1.4 million people a year to the already huge population
  of 60 million exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the land area available
  for agriculture.

*El Salvador, Economy

Overview:
  The agricultural sector accounts for 24% of GDP, employs about 40% of the
  labor force, and contributes about 66% to total exports. Coffee is the major
  commercial crop, accounting for 45% of export earnings. The manufacturing
  sector, based largely on food and beverage processing, accounts for 18% of
  GDP and 15% of employment. Economic losses because of guerrilla sabotage
  total more than $2 billion since 1979. The costs of maintaining a large
  military seriously constrain the government's efforts to provide essential
  social services. Nevertheless, growth in national output during the period
  1990-92 exceeded growth in population for the first time since 1987.

*Equatorial Guinea, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, devastated during the regime of former President Macias NGUEMA,
  is based on agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for about half
  of GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence agriculture predominates, with
  cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign exchange, and
  government revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts for about
  8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for about
  38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese,
  uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under concessions
  offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately successful.
  Increased production from recently discovered natural gas deposits will
  provide a greater share of exports by 1995.

*Eritrea, Economy

Overview:
  With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea faces the bitter
  economic problems of a small, desperately poor African country. Most of the
  population will continue to depend on subsistence farming. Domestic output
  is substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government
  revenues come from custom duties and income and sales taxes. Eritrea has
  inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for
  revenues from the devlopment of offshore oil, offshore fishing and tourist
  development. For the time being, Ethiopia will be largely dependent on
  Eritrean ports for its foreign trade.

*Estonia, Economy

Overview:
  As of June 1993 Estonia ranks first among the 15 former Soviet republics in
  moving from its obsolete command economy to a modern market economy. Yet
  serious problems remain. In contrast to the estimated 30% drop in output in
  1992, GDP should grow by a small percent in 1993. Of key importance has been
  the introduction of the kroon in August 1993 and the subsequent reductions
  in inflation to 1%-2% per month. Starting in July 1991, under a new law on
  private ownership, small enterprises, such as retail shops and restaurants,
  were sold to private owners. The auctioning of large-scale enterprises is
  progressing with the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership
  (that is, Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States) can be
  established. Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former
  Soviet republics. Agriculture is well developed, especially meat production,
  and provides a surplus for export. Only about one-fifth of the work force is
  in agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing
  both capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate
  products from the other former Soviet republics. These manufactures are of
  high quality by ex-Soviet standards and are exported to the other republics.
  Estonia's mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil (60%
  of the old Soviet total) and phosphorites (400 million tons). Estonia has a
  large, relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy
  needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants. It has advantages in the
  transition, not having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having
  better chances of developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European
  countries. Like Latvia, but unlike Lithuania, the large portion of ethnic
  Russians (30%) in the population poses still another difficulty in the
  transition to an independent market economy.

*Ethiopia, Economy

Overview:
  With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia continues to
  face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest and least developed
  countries in Africa. (The accompanying analysis and figures predate the
  independence of Eritrea.) Its economy is based on subsistence agriculture,
  which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total
  employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The manufacturing
  sector is heavily dependent on inputs from the agricultural sector. Over 90%
  of large-scale industry, but less than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the
  government is considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants.
  Favorable agricultural weather largely explains the 4.5% growth in output in
  FY89, whereas drought and deteriorating internal security conditions
  prevented growth in FY90. In 1991 the lack of law and order, particularly in
  the south, interfered with economic development and growth. In 1992, because
  of some easing of civil strife and aid from the outside world, the economy
  substantially improved.

*Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), Economy

Overview:
  The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs
  most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
  consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those
  for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to
  the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
  surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,
  efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In
  1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
  operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees
  amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income
  for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
  Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
  wildlife and trout fishing.

*Faroe Islands, Economy

Overview:
  The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living standards of the
  Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
  all-important fishing industry and one of the world's heaviest per capita
  external debts of nearly $30,000. When the nations of the world extended
  their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no
  longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing and
  subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The government's tight
  controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures have caused a recession,
  and subsidy cuts will force nationalization in the fishing industry, which
  has already been plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to
  withhold its annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the
  islands' budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to
  balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected to
  continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20% VAT in 1993, and
  has agreed to an IMF economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to
  its annual subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out the second largest
  Faroe bank to the tune of $140 million since October 1992.

*Fiji, Economy

Overview:
  Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence sector.
  Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange, and sugar processing
  accounts for one-third of industrial output. Industry, including sugar
  milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji traditionally had earned considerable
  sums of hard currency from the 250,000 tourists who visited each year. In
  1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP
  dropped by 7.8% in 1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainty
  created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
  production to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong
  performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990 the
  economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an
  estimated 21%. Sugar exports recovered in 1991-92.

*Finland, Economy

Overview:
  Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market economy, with per
  capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key economic sector is
  manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering industries.
  Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP.
  Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw
  materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of
  the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining
  self-sufficiency in basic products. The economy, which experienced an
  average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into deep
  recession in 1991 as growth contracted by 6.5%. The recession - which
  continued in 1992 with growth contracting by 3.5% - has been caused by
  economic overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the
  barter system between Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet
  oil and gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish
  Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and
  efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public
  expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and changes in
  monetary policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the EC's
  European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability. Ongoing speculation
  resulting from a lack of confidence in the government's policies forced
  Helsinki to devalue the markka by about 12% in November 1991 and to
  indefinitely break the link in September 1992. By boosting the
  competitiveness of Finnish exports, these measures presumably have kept the
  economic downturn from being even more severe. Unemployment probably will
  remain a serious problem during the next few years - monthly figures in
  early 1993 are approaching 20% - with the majority of Finnish firms facing a
  weak domestic market and the troubled German and Swedish export markets.
  Declining revenues, increased transfer payments, and extensive funding to
  bail out the banking system are expected to push the central government's
  budget deficit to nearly 13% in 1993. Helsinki continues to harmonize its
  economic policies with those of the EC during Finland's current EC
  membership bid.

*France, Economy

Overview:
  One of the world's most developed economies, France has substantial
  agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector.
  Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and
  subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
  Western Europe. France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural products
  and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector
  generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has
  become crucial to the economy. The French economy is entering its fourth
  consecutive year of sluggish growth after a strong expansion in the late
  1980s. Growth averaged only 1.3% in 1990-92 and is expected to drop to
  between zero and -0.5% in 1993. The government budget deficit rose to 3.2%
  of GDP in 1992 and is expected to be far larger than planned in the 1993
  budget. Paris remains committed to maintaining the franc-deutsch mark
  parity, which has kept French interest rates high despite France's low
  inflation. Although the pace of economic integration within the European
  Community has slowed down, integration presumably will remain a major force
  shaping the fortunes of the various economic sectors.

*French Guiana, Economy

Overview:
  The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and imports.
  Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most
  important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish products
  (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1987. The
  large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an
  expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation
  of crops - rice, cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - is limited to the coastal
  area, where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily
  dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem,
  particularly among younger workers.

*Gabon, Economy

Overview:
  The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early 1970s, is now
  dominated by the oil sector. In 1981-85, oil accounted for about 45% of GDP,
  80% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on average. The high
  oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial increase in per
  capita national income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced migration
  from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to among the
  highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The subsequent slide of Gabon's economy,
  which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989-90, but
  debt servicing obligations continue to limit prospects for further domestic
  development. Real growth in 1991-92 was weak because of a combination of an
  overstaffed bureaucracy, a large budget deficit, and the continued
  underdevelopment of the whole economy outside the petroleum sector.

*The Gambia, Economy

Overview:
  The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural resources and has a
  limited agricultural base. It is one of the world's poorest countries with a
  per capita income of about $325. About 75% of the population is engaged in
  crop production and livestock raising, which contribute 30% to GDP.
  Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing peanuts, fish, and hides -
  accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia
  imports one-third of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods.
  Exports are concentrated on peanut products (about 75% of total value).

*Gaza Strip, Header

Note:
  The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
  control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
  Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David accords and reaffirmed by
  President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
  West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
  peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
  concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
  resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
  it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
  has yet to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes all
  of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
  the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
  framework agreement, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be
  made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's
  special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the
  final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
  rest of the West Bank.

*Gaza Strip, Economy

Overview:
  In 1990 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by
  Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
  remittances accounting for about one-third of GNP. The construction,
  agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15%, 12%, and 8% of
  GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90% of its external
  trade. Unrest in the territory in 1988-93 (intifadah) has raised
  unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The
  Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza
  since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged,
  unemployment has increased, and exports have fallen dramatically. The area's
  economic outlook remains bleak.

*Georgia, Economy

Overview:
  Among the former Soviet republics, Georgia has been noted for its Black Sea
  tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and an
  industrial sector that accounted, however, for less than 2% of the USSR's
  output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has been a flourishing
  private sector (compared with the other republics). About 25% of the labor
  force is employed in agriculture. Mineral resources consist of manganese and
  copper, and, to a lesser extent, molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury.
  Except for very small quantities of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must
  be imported from neighboring republics. Oil and its products have been
  delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to the port of Batumi for export and
  local refining. Gas has been supplied in pipelines from Krasnodar and
  Stavropol'. The dismantling of central economic controls has been delayed by
  political factionalism, marked by bitter armed struggles. In early 1993 the
  Georgian economy was operating at well less than half capacity due to
  disruptions in fuel supplies and vital transportation links as a result of
  conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, antigovernment activity in Western
  Georgia, and Azerbaijani pressure against Georgian assistance for Armenia.
  To restore economic viability, Georgia must establish domestic peace and
  must maintain economic ties to the other former Soviet republics while
  developing new links to the West.

*Germany, Economy

Overview:
  With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, prospects seemed
  bright for a fairly rapid incorporation of East Germany into the highly
  successful West German economy. The Federal Republic, however, continues to
  experience difficulties in integrating and modernizing eastern Germany, and
  the tremendous costs of unification have sunk western Germany deeper into
  recession. The western German economy grew by less than 1% in 1992 as the
  Bundesbank set high interest rates to offset the inflationary effects of
  large government deficits and high wage settlements. Eastern Germany grew by
  6.8% in 1992 but this was from a shrunken base. Despite government transfers
  to the east amounting to nearly $110 billion annually, a self-sustaining
  economy in the region is still some years away. The bright spots are eastern
  Germany's construction, transportation, telecommunications, and service
  sectors, which have experienced strong growth. Western Germany has an
  advanced market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly
  urbanized and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards,
  abundant leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western
  Germany is relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most
  important mineral. Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture
  technologically advanced goods. The region's economy is mature: services and
  manufacturing account for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw
  materials and semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports.
  In recent years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with
  other sectors contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1992
  accounted for about 21.5% of GDP. GDP in the western region is now $20,000
  per capita, or 85% of US per capita GDP. Eastern Germany's economy appears
  to be changing from one anchored on manufacturing into a more
  service-oriented economy. The German government, however, is intent on
  maintaining a manufacturing base in the east and is considering a policy for
  subsidizing industrial cores in the region. Eastern Germany's share of
  all-German GDP is only 7% and eastern productivity is just 30% that of the
  west even though eastern wages are at roughly 70% of western levels. The
  privatization agency for eastern Germany, Treuhand, has privatized more than
  four-fifths of the almost 12,000 firms under its control and will likely
  wind down operations in 1994. Private investment in the region continues to
  be lackluster, resulting primarily from the deepening recession in western
  Germany and excessively high eastern wages. Eastern Germany has one of the
  world's largest reserves of low-grade lignite coal but little else in the
  way of mineral resources. The quality of statistics from eastern Germany is
  improving, yet many gaps remain; the federal government began producing
  all-German data for select economic statistics at the start of 1992. The
  most challenging economic problem is promoting eastern Germany's economic
  reconstruction - specifically, finding the right mix of fiscal, monetary,
  regulatory, and tax policies that will spur investment in eastern Germany -
  without destabilizing western Germany's economy or damaging relations with
  West European partners. The government hopes a "solidarity pact" among labor
  unions, business, state governments, and the SPD opposition will provide the
  right mix of wage restraints, investment incentives, and spending cuts to
  stimulate eastern recovery. Finally, the homogeneity of the German economic
  culture has been changed by the admission of large numbers of immigrants.

*Ghana, Economy

Overview:
  Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
  implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
  moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
  dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not
  spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
  peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
  democratic government have boosted government expenditures and undercut
  structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in 1990.
  Meanwhile, declining world commodity prices for Ghana's exports has placed
  the government under severe financial pressure.

*Greece, Economy

Overview:
  Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic entrepreneurial system
  overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that enlarged the public sector
  from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% when Prime Minister MITSOTAKIS took
  office. Tourism continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and
  agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
  feedstuffs. Since 1986, real GDP growth has averaged only 1.6% a year,
  compared with the Europen Community average of 3%. The MITSOTAKIS government
  has made little progress during its two and one-half years in power in
  coming to grips with Greece's main economic problems: an inflation rate
  still four times the EC average, a large public sector deficit, and a
  fragile current account position. In early 1991, the government secured a
  three-year, $2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest
  terms yet imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience
  with Greece's failure to put its financial affairs in order. On the advice
  of the EC Commission, Greece delayed applying for the second installment
  until 1993 because of the failure of the government to meet the 1992
  targets. Although MITSOTAKIS faced down the unions in mid-1992 in a dispute
  over privatization plans, social security reform, and tax and price
  increases, and his new economics czar, Stephanos MANOS, is a respected
  economist committed to renovating the ailing economy. However, a national
  elections due by May 1994 will probably prompt MITSOTAKIS to backtrack on
  economic reform. In 1993, the GDP growth rate likely will remain low; the
  inflation rate probably will continue to fall, while remaining the highest
  in the EC.

*Greenland, Economy

Overview:
  Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult and unemployment
  increases. Prospects for economic growth in the immediate future are not
  bright. The Home Rule Government's economic restraint measures introduced in
  the late 1980s have assisted in shifting red figures into a balance in the
  public budget. Foreign trade produced a surplus in 1989 and 1990, but has
  now returned to a deficit. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and
  zinc mine in 1989, Greenland today is fully dependent on fishing and fish
  processing, this sector accounting for 95% of exports. Prospects for
  fisheries are not bright, as the important shrimp catches will at best
  stabilize and cod catches have dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon
  activities is not around the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some
  potential for the near future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e. the HRG
  and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in
  Greenland accounting for about two thirds of total employment. About half
  the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish Government.

*Guadeloupe, Economy

Overview:
  The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.
  It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism is
  a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly
  large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important
  sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas
  (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers.
  Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,
  although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly
  from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production.
  Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
  high among the young.

*Guyana, Economy

Overview:
  Guyana is one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita income less
  than one-fifth the South American average. After growing on average at less
  than 1% a year in 1986-87, GDP dropped by 5% a year in 1988-90. The decline
  resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the cane fields, and flooding
  and equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about
  100% in 1989 and 75% in 1990, and the current account deficit widened
  substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power
  has been in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in
  national output. The government, in association with international financial
  agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The
  government's stabilization program - aimed at establishing realistic
  exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth -
  requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
  by consumers during a long incubation period. Buoyed by a recovery in mining
  and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth in 1991 and 7% growth in 1992,
  according to official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi-legal
  economic activity is not captured in estimates of the country's total
  output.

*Haiti, Economy

Overview:
  About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is mainly
  small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly three-fourths of the work
  force. The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe
  drinking water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. Few social
  assistance programs exist, and the lack of employment opportunities remains
  one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil
  erosion and political instability. Trade sanctions applied by the
  Organization of American States in response to the September 1991 coup
  against President ARISTIDE have further damaged the economy.

*Honduras, Economy

Overview:
  Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
  Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for more
  than 25% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces two-thirds of
  exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early stages,
  employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates
  20% of exports. The service sectors, including public administration,
  account for 50% of GDP and employ nearly 20% of the labor force. Basic
  problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high
  unemployment, a lack of basic services, a large and inefficient public
  sector, and the dependence of the export sector mostly on coffee and
  bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations. A far-reaching
  reform program initiated by President CALLEJAS in 1990 is beginning to take
  hold.

*Hong Kong, Economy

Overview:
  Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
  barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
  imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of the
  labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a
  remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2%
  in 1991 and 5.9% in 1992. Unemployment, which has been declining since the
  mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put upward
  pressure on prices and the cost of living. Short-term prospects remain
  bright so long as major trading partners continue to be reasonably
  prosperous.

*Hungary, Economy

Overview:
  Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition from a command to a market
  economy. Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export
  earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 40% of
  GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that less than 25% of foreign
  trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD
  members. Hungary's economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
  a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment.
  In 1991, Hungary received 60% of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe,
  and in 1992 received the largest single share. The growing private sector
  accounts for about one-third of national output according to unofficial
  estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progressing, although
  excessive red tape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about pricing
  have slowed the process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of inflation
  may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform, while
  Hungary's heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to introduce
  full convertibility of the forint before 1994 and to rein in inflation. The
  government is projecting an end to the 5-year recession in 1993, and GDP is
  forecast to grow 0%-3%.

*Iceland, Economy

Overview:
  Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, but with an
  extensive welfare system, relatively low unemployment, and comparatively
  even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
  industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of
  the workforce. In the absence of other natural resources - except energy -
  Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. Iceland's
  economy has been in recession since 1988. The recession deepened in 1992 due
  to severe cutbacks in fishing quotas and falling world prices for the
  country's main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon.
  Real GDP declined 3.3% in 1992 and is forecast to contract another 1.5% in
  1993. The center-right government's economic goals include reducing the
  budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing
  inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the
  economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The recession has led to a
  wave of bankruptcies and mergers throughout the economy, as well as the
  highest unemployment of the post-World War II period. The national
  unemployment rate reached 5% in early 1993, with some parts of the country
  experiencing unemployment in the 9-10% range. Inflation, previously a
  serious problem, declined from double digit rates in the 1980s to only 3.7%
  in 1992.

*India, Economy

Overview:
  India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming, modern
  agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude
  of support services. Faster economic growth in the 1980s permitted a
  significant increase in real per capita private consumption. A large share
  of the population, perhaps as much as 40%, remains too poor to afford an
  adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990 and 1991 prompted government
  austerity measures that slowed industrial growth but permitted India to meet
  its international payment obligations without rescheduling its debt. Policy
  reforms since 1991 have extended earlier economic liberalization and greatly
  reduced government controls on production, trade, and investment.

*Indian Ocean, Economy

Overview:
  The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle East,
  Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries a
  particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oil
  fields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing
  importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export.
  Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian
  Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being
  tapped in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western
  Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes
  from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore
  placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly
  India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
  based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
  minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
  placer deposits

*Indonesia, Economy

Overview:
  Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
  planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
  Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly
  increasing population, it remains a poor country. Real GDP growth in 1985-92
  averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
  underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the
  labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important
  sector, accounting for almost 20% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force.
  The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia
  is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and
  textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
  generation. Industrial output now accounts for almost 40% of GDP and is
  based on a supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural
  gas, timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the
  external economy, generating more than 20% of the government's revenues and
  40% of export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's growth is highly
  dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan remains
  Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the
  money supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary
  policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for
  investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and off-shore
  commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted Jakarta to limit
  foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the continued problems in
  moving toward a more open financial system and the persistence of a fairly
  tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992 is estimated to have stayed at
  6%.

*Iran, Economy

Overview:
  Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and
  other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private
  trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, Iran's
  real GDP grew by 10% in FY90 and 6% in FY91, according to Iranian Government
  statistics. An oil windfall in 1990 combined with a substantial increase in
  imports contributed to Iran's recent economic growth. Iran has also begun
  implementing a number of economic reforms to reduce government intervention
  (including subsidies) and has allocated substantial resources to development
  projects in the hope of stimulating the economy. Lower oil revenues in 1991
  - oil accounts for more than 90% of export revenues - together with a surge
  in imports greatly weakened Iran's international financial position. By
  mid-1992 Iran was unable to meet its obligations to foreign creditors.
  Subsequently the government has tried to boost oil exports, curb imports
  (especially of consumer goods), and renegotiate terms of its foreign debts.

*Iraq, Economy

Overview:
  The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of
  industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some small-scale
  industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The
  economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally
  provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial
  problems caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and
  damage to oil export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement
  austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt
  payments. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually
  increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
  facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages,
  salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform and
  collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high
  priority by the government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's
  seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic
  embargoes, and military action by an international coalition beginning in
  January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture. Industrial and
  transportation facilities suffered severe damage and have been only
  partially restored. Oil exports remain at less than 10% of the previous
  level. Shortages of spare parts continue. Living standards deteriorated even
  further in 1992 and early 1993; consumer prices at least tripled in 1992.
  The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and imports and has
  contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The government's policies of
  supporting large military and internal security forces and of allocating
  resources to key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In
  brief, per capita output in early 1993 is far below the 1989-90 level, but
  no reliable estimate is available.
