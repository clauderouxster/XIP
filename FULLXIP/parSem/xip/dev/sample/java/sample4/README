This example shows how a java application can load a grammar, parse a string, and build XipResult data.
In this example we are using a method handler which processes each sentence just after its analyse: this 
avoid to parse the input file and to store all the information in memory.
These XipResult java structures contain the parsing result.

See the classes: XipResultManager, XipResult, XipUnit, XipNode, XipLeaf, XipDependency, XipFeature.
