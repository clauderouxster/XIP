    Gaul

Settled mainly by the Gauls  and related Celtic
 peoples (apart from a shrinking area of Basque
 population in the south-west), the area of modern France
 comprised the bulk of the region of Gaul 
(Latin /Gallia/) under Roman  rule from the 1st
century BC to the 5th century AD.


    Franks

In 486 , Clovis I , leader of the Salian
Franks  to the east, conquered the Roman territory between
the Loire and the Somme, subsequently uniting most of northern and
central France under his rule and adopting (496 ) the Roman
Catholic  form of Christianity 
in preference to the Arianism  preferred by rival
Germanic rulers.

After Clovis's death (511 ) his realm underwent repeated
division while his Merovingian  dynasty eventually
lost effective power to their successive mayors of the palace, the
founders of what was to become the Carolingian 
dynasty. The assumption of the crown in 751  by Pepin the Short  (son of Charles Martel
) established Carolingian rule in name as well as
in fact.

The new rulers' power reached its fullest extent under Pepin's son
Charlemagne , (Charles the Great), who in 771
 reunited the Frankish domains after a further period of
division, subsequently conquering the Lombard  kingdom
in northern Italy  (774 ), incorporating Bavaria
 (788 ) into his realm, defeating the Avars of
the Danubian plain (796 ), advancing the frontier with Muslim
Spain as south as Barcelona (801 ), and subjugating Lower
Saxony  (804 ) after prolonged campaigning.

In recognition of his successes and his political support for the Papacy
, Charlemagne was in 800  crowned Emperor of
the Romans, or Roman Emperor in the West, by Pope Leo III
: on the death of his son Louis I
 (emperor 814 -840 ),
however, the empire was divided among Louis's three sons (Treaty of
Verdun , 843 ). After a last brief
reunification (884 -887 ), the imperial title
ceased to be held in the western part which was to form the basis of the
future French kingdom.


    France in the Middle Ages

During the latter years of the elderly Charlemagne 's
rule, the Vikings  made advances along the northern and
western perimeters of his kingdom. After Charlemagne's death in 814 his
heirs were incapable of maintaining any kind of political unity and the
once great Empire began to crumble. Viking advances were allowed to
escalate, their dreaded longboats were sailing up the Loire and Seine
Rivers and other inland waterways, wreaking havoc and spreading terror.
In 843 the Viking invaders murdered the Bishop of Nantes 
and a few years after that, they burned the Church of Saint-Martin at
Tours . Emboldened by their successes, in 845 the Vikings
ransacked Paris.

During the reign of Charles the Simple (898-922) whose territory
comprised much of the France of today, he was forced to concede to the
Vikings a large area on either side of the Seine River, downstream from
Paris, that was to become Normandy .

The Carolingians were subsequently to share the fate of their
predecessors: after an intermittent power struggle between the two
families, the accession (987 ) of Hugh Capet
, duke of France and count of Paris, established on
the throne the Capetian  dynasty which with its Valois
and Bourbon offshoots was to rule France for more than 800 years.

The Carolingian era had seen the gradual emergence of institutions which
were to condition France's development for centuries to come: the
acknowledgement by the crown of the administrative authority of the
realm's nobles within their territories in return for their (sometimes
tenuous) loyalty and military support, a phenomenon readily visible in
the rise of the Capetians and foreshadowed to some extent by the
Carolingians' own rise to power.

The new order left the new dynasty in immediate control of little beyond
the middle Seine and adjacent territories, while powerful territorial
lords such as the 10th and 11th-century counts of Blois accumulated
large domains of their own through marriage and through private
arrangements with lesser nobles for protection and support.

The area around the lower Seine , ceded to Scandinavian
 invaders as the duchy of Normandy 
in 911 , became a source of particular concern when duke
William  took possession of the kingdom of
England  in 1066 , making himself and his
heirs the king's equal outside France (where he was still nominally
subject to the crown).

Worse was to follow, with the succession (1154 ) to the
disputed English throne of Henry II , already
count of Anjou and duke of Normandy before his marriage (1152
) to France's newly-divorced ex-queen Eleanor of Aquitaine
brought him control also of much of south-west France. A century of
intermittent warfare brought Normandy once more under French control
(1204 ) and French victory at Bouvines (1214 ).

The 13th century  was to bring the crown important
gains also in the south, where a papal-royal crusade against the
region's Albigensian or Cathar heretics (1209 ) led to the
incorporation into the royal domain of Lower (1229 ) and
Upper (1271 ) Languedoc . Philippe IV
's seizure of Flanders 
(1300 ) was less sucessful, ending two years later in the
rout of her knights by the forces of the Flemish cities at the "battle
of the spurs" near Courtrai (Kortrijk).


    Valois Dynasty

The extinction of the main Capetian line (1328 ) brought to
the throne the related house of Valois , but as
Philippe IV's grandson, Edward III of England
 claimed the French crown for himself,
inaugurating the succession of conflicts known collectively as the
Hundred Years' War . The following century
was to see devastating warfare, peasant revolts in both England (Wat
Tyler's revolt of 1381 ) and France (the /Jacquerie/ of 1358
) and the growth of nationhood in both countries.

French losses in the first phase of the conflict (1337 ) were partly reversed in the second (1369 ); but Henry V of England 's
shattering victory at the battle of Agincourt
 in 1415  against a France now
bitterly divided between rival Armagnac and Burgundian factions of the
royal house was to lead to his son Henry VI's recognition as king in
Paris seven years later under the 1420  Treaty of Troyes
, reducing Valois rule
to the lands south of the Loire  River.

France's humiliation was abruptly reversed in 1429  by the
appearance of a restorationist movement symbolised by the Lorraine
peasant maid Joan of Arc , who claimed the guidance
of divine voices for the campaign which rapidly ended the English siege
of Orlens and ended in Charles VII 's
coronation in the historic city of Reims . Subsequently
captured by the Burgundians and sold to their English allies, her
execution for heresy in 1431  redoubled her value as the
embodiment of France's cause.

Reconciliation between the king and Philippe of Burgundy
 (1435
) removed the greatest obstacle to French recovery, leading
to the recapture of Paris (1436 ), Normandy (1450
) and Guienne 
(1453 ), reducing England's foothold to a small area around
Calais  (lost also in 1558 ). After the war,
France's emergence as a powerful national monarchy was crowned by the
incorporation of the duchy of Burgundy (1477 ) and Brittany
 (1491 ).

The losses of the century of war were enormous, particularly owing to
the plague (the Black Death , usually considered an
outbreak of bubonic plague), which arrived from Italy in 1348
, spreading rapidly up the Rhone valley and thence across
most of the country: it is estimated that a population of some 18-20
million in modern-day France at the time of the 1328 
hearth-tax  returns had been
reduced 150 years later by 40% or more.

Despite the beginnings of rapid demographic and economic recovery, the
gains of the previous half-century were to be jeopardised by a further
protracted series of conflicts, this time in Italy (1494
-1559 ), where French efforts to gain dominance
ended in the increased power of the Habsburg  Holy Roman
Emperors of Germany.

Barely were the Italian Wars over than France was plunged into a
domestic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Despite the conclusion
of a Concordat between France and the Papacy (1516 ),
granting the crown unrivalled power in senior ecclesiastical
appointments, France was deeply affected by the Protestant Reformation
's attempt to break the unity of Roman
Catholic  Europe.

A growing urban-based Protestant minority (later dubbed /Huguenots
/) faced ever harsher repression under the rule of King
Henri II . Renewed Catholic reaction headed by
the powerful dukes of Guise culminated in a massacre of Huguenots (1562
), starting the first of the French Wars of Religion
 during which English, (Scottish?),
German and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and
Catholic forces.


    Bourbon Dynasty

The conflict was ended by the assassination of both Henri of Guise
 (1588 ) and
king Henri III  (1589 ), the
accession of the Protestant king of Navarre as Henri IV
 (first king of the Bourbon dynasty) and his
subsequent abandonment of Protestantism (1593 ), his
acceptance by most of the Catholic establishment (1594 ) and
by the Pope (1595 ), and his issue of the toleration decree
known as the Edict of Nantes  (1598
), which guaranteed freedom of private worship and civil
equality.

France's pacification under Henri laid much of the ground for the
beginnings after his assassination (1610 ) of France's rise
to European hegemony under Louis XIII  and
his minister (1624 -1642 ) Cardinal Richelieu
, architect of France's policy against Spain
 and the German emperor during the Thirty Years' War
 (1618 -1648 ) which
had broken out among the lands of Germany's Holy Roman Empire.

An English-backed Huguenot rebellion (1625 ) defeated, France intervened directlly (1635 )
in the wider European conflict following her ally (Protestant) Sweden
's failure to build upon initial success. After the death
of both king and cardinal, the Peace of Westphalia
 (1648 ) secured universal
acceptance of Germany's political and religious fragmentation, and the
Treaty of the Pyrenees
 (1659
) formalised France's seizure (1642) of the Spanish
territory of Roussillon  after the crushing of the
efemerous Catalan Republic.

During the reign of Louis XIV  (1643
-1715 ), France was the dominant power in
Europe, aided by the diplomacy of Richelieu's successor (1642
-1661 ) Cardinal Mazarin  and the
economic policies (1661 -1683 ) of Colbert
. Renewed war (1667 -1668  and
1672 -1678 ) brought further territorial gains
(Artois  and western Flanders  and the
free county of Burgundy, left to the Empire in 1482 ), but
at the cost of the increasingly concerted opposition of rival powers.

Following the seizure of the (then separate) English, Irish and Scottish
thrones by the Dutch prince William of Orange
 in 1688 , the anti-French
"Grand Alliance " of 1689  inaugurated
more than a century of intermittent European conflict in which Britain
would play an ever more important role, seeking in particular to keep
France out of the Netherlands (the Dutch provinces and the future
Belgium, then under Spanish rule).

After the war of 1689 -1697  gained France only
Haiti  (lost to a slave revolt a century later), the War of
the Spanish Succession (1701 -1713 ) ended with
the undoing of Louis's dreams of a Franco-Spanish Bourbon empire: the
two conflicts strained French resources already weakened by disastrous
harvests in the 1690s  and in 1709 , as well as
by the revocation (1685 ) of the Edict of Nantes and the
consequent loss of Huguenot  support and manpower.

The reign (1715 -1774 ) of Louis XV
 saw an initial return to peace and prosperity
under the regency (1715 -1723 ) of Philippe II
, duke of Orleans, whose policies were
largely continued (1726 -1743 ) by Cardinal
Fleury , prime minister in all
but name, renewed war with the Empire (1733  and 1740 -1748 ) being fought
largely in the East. But alliance with the traditional Habsburg enemy
(the "Diplomatic Revolution
" of 1756
 against the rising power of Britain and Prussia
 led to costly failure in the Seven Years' War
 (1756 -1763 ).


    French Revolution

Louis XVI 's reign (1774 ) saw a temporary revival of French fortunes through
intervention (1778 -1783 ) in support of
Britain's rebel American colonies. But the over-ambitious projects and
military campaigns the past century had produced chronic financial
problems. Deteriorating economic conditions, popular resentment against
the complicated system of privileges granted the nobility and clerics,
and a lack of alternate avenues for change were among the principal
causes of the French Revolution . This led to
the formation of the First Republic . The Second
Republic  was later proclaimed on February 26
, 1848 .

Although the revolutionaries advocated republican and egalitarian
principles of government, France reverted to forms of absolute rule or
constitutional monarchy four times:

    * the First Empire  of Napoleon
      
    * the Restoration  of Louis XVIII
      
    * the July Monarchy 
      of Louis-Philippe 
    * the Second Empire  of Napoleon III
.

    Third Republic

After the Franco-Prussian War  of 1870
, the Third Republic  was established
and lasted until the military defeat of 1940 .

World War I  (1914 -1918 )
brought great losses of troops and materiel. In the 1920s ,
France established an elaborate system of border defenses (the Maginot
Line ) and alliances (see Little Entente
) to offset resurgent
German strength.


    France during World War II

France  surrendered to Nazi Germany 
early in World War II  (June 24 ,
1940 ). Nazi Germany occupied three fifth of France's
territory leaving the rest to the new Vichy 
collaboration  government established on July 10
, 1940  under Henri Philippe Pétain
. Its senior leaders acquiesced in the
plunder of French resources, as well as the sending of French forced
labor to Germany; in doing so, they claimed they hoped to preserve at
least some small amount of French sovereignty. The German occupation
proved costly, however, as Germany appropriated a full one-half of
France's public sector revenue.

On the other hand, those who refused defeat and collaboration with Nazi
Germany , the Free French ,
organised resistance movements  in occupied and
Vichy France and the Free French Forces . The
Free French Forces started in exile in and with the support of the UK
.

After four years of occupation and strife, Allied forces, including Free
France , liberated France in 1944 .


    France since 1945

France emerged from World War II to face a series of new problems. After
a short period of provisional government initially led by General
Charles de Gaulle , a new constitution (October
1946 ) established the Fourth Republic
 under a parliamentary
form of government controlled by a series of coalitions. The mixed
nature of the coalitions and a consequent lack of agreement on measures
for dealing with colonial wars in Indochina  and
Algeria  caused successive cabinet crises and changes of
government.

The May 1958  seizure of power in Algiers  by
French army units and French settlers opposed to concessions in the face
of Arab nationalist insurrection led to the fall of the French
government and a presidential invitation to de Gaulle to form an
emergency government to forestall the threat of civil war. Swiftly
replacing the existing constitution with one strengthening the powers of
the presidency, he became the elected president in December of that
year, inaugurating France's Fifth Republic .

Seven years later, in an occasion marking the first time in the 20th
century that the people of France went to the polls to elect a president
by direct ballot, de Gaulle won re-election with a 55% share of the
vote, defeating Francois Mitterrand . In
April 1969 , de Gaulle resigned following the defeat in a
national referendum of government proposals for the creation of 21
regions with limited political powers. Succeeding him as president of
France have been:

     Gaullist Georges Pompidou  (1969  -1974 ) ;
    Independent Republican Valery Giscard d'Estaing  (1974 -81) ;
    Socialist Francois Mitterrand (1981 -95) ;
    neo-Gaullist Jacques Chirac  (elected in Spring 1995 ).

While France continues to revere its rich history and independence,
French leaders increasingly tie the future of France to the continued
development of the European Union  (EU). During
President Mitterrand's tenure, he stressed the importance of European
integration and advocated the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty
 on European economic and political union,
which France's electorate narrowly approved in September 1992 .

Current President Jacques Chirac  assumed office
May 17 , 1995 , after a campaign focused on
the need to combat France's stubbornly high unemployment
 rate. The center of domestic attention soon
shifted, however, to the economic reform and belt-tightening measures
required for France to meet the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU ) laid out by the Maastricht Treaty. In late 1995,
France experienced its worst labor unrest in at least a decade, as
employees protested government cutbacks.

On the foreign and security policy front, Chirac took a more assertive
approach to protecting French peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia
 and helped promote the peace accords negotiated in
Dayton, Ohio  and signed in Paris in December
1995. The French have stood among the strongest supporters of NATO
 and EU policy in the Balkans.
