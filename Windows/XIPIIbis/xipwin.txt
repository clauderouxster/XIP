I) Utilization of XIPWIN

The files that are used by the solaris version and the xipwin version are exactly the same to the exception of their extension.

Since WINDOWS expects files to have specific extensions in order to filter out files when the loading window is displayed, we have modified those extensions a bit for that purpose.

IMPORTANT: Since the solaris files do not have those extensions, it will be necessary for the windows version to rename those files (specially the ntm and the hmm files) to comply with the rules below.

a) All grammar files should have the extension: .xip

Example:

english.xip (the language file)
features.xip
control.xip
translation.xip

b) All parameter files should have the extension: .par

Example:

config.par


c) The ntm file script should have the extension: .lex

Example:

ntmscript.lex

d) The hmm file should have the extension: .hmm

II) Launching of XIP

When XIP is launched, a sequence of window to load different files is displayed:

a) The grammar script file window (english.xip)
b) The ntm file window (ntmscript.lex)
c) The hmm file window (hmm-std.hmm)
d) A loop to load different parameter file: click on cancel to skip that loop

Once those files have been loaded, it is then possible to use the Typing Window to enter sentences or to load text in (see option: Open Text File).

The "Reload Grammar" option does not require those filenames to be reentered again.
The indent option displays the result as an indented file in a specific widow.

The "T" and "G" toggles between displaying the graphical tree or not.
