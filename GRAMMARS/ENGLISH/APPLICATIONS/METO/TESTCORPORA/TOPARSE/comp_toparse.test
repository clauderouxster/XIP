An example of this was the takeover by CGE through a subsidiary, Alcatel, of the European telecommunications side of ITT in 1986.

Similar takeovers have been launched by the French chemical company, Rhone-Poulenc (which recently spent over £3 billion in acquisitions), by Usinor-Sacilor and by Renault.

Gerstner is praised for his achievement in cutting debt in half at RJR Nabisco Corp, a collection of mature low and medium technology businesses -- but cutting the debt of the burdensomely leveraged company was the job of whoever became chief executive at RJR Nabisco: it's much harder to define exactly what the job is at IBM. 
The one indication that Gerstner recognises the problem will be his approach to the top jobs at each of IBM's most important businesses. 
His first act needs to be to get the corporate search people straight back into action looking for outsiders to run the AS/400 business -- someone from <annot><org reading="unknown"> Hewlett-Packard </org></annot> perhaps, the disk business, the chip business, the software and services business. 
That too might be characterised as a courageous move -- but nothing like as courageous as that of James Burke and his cohorts in deciding that the right man to dig IBM out of its hole was outsider Louis V Gerstner Jr.

The processing architecture of IBM Corp's computers is increasingly focusing around its Power RISC technology as a means of constructing systems of faster performance for a lower cost, says William Filip, vice president of IBM and president of IBM's Advanced Workstations and Systems Division. 
In a presentation in Paris last week, Filip, whose division handles the RS/6000, said his group's technology is " not restricted at all " to only the RS/6000 series of workstations. 
Using processors based on the Power RISC architecture, which has also been adopted by Apple Computer Inc, Motorola Inc and Groupe Bull SA, Filip said <annot><org reading="unknown"> IBM </org></annot> " will go aggressively into the low-end personal computer market next year with RISC technology. "

Word has it that an unlikely combination of forces have come together in a bid to establish a new standard for installing Unix software from graphical user interfaces and will be showing their stuff next month's Uniforum show in San Francisco.

The standard will reportedly provide a standard set of techniques for independent software vendors to write to and should allow users to get Unix applications up and running from an install icon within a variety of graphical environments without the need to go back down to the shell, be they native or guest implementations.

OSI was established as a direct rival to <annotorg> IBM </annotorg>'s systems network architecture (SNA (which was intended to allow all IBM machines to talk to each other, while locking out non-SNA equipment. 
The grand alliance of OSI became public in May 1985 when a meeting of 20 computer companies, dominated by US rivals of IBM, met in conference and established the Corporation for Open Systems.

Prima facie a clause which specifies review date by reference to the commencement of the term requires the measurement to be taken from the date from which the term is computed, and not the date of the lease (Beaumont Property Trust v Tai (1982) 265 EG 872). 
The valuation date will usually be the rent review date; and the court will lean in favour of a construction which produces the result that the rent is valued by reference to values prevailing at the start of the period for which it is payable (Glofield Properties v Morley (No 2) [ 1989 ] 2 EGLR 118).

Despite a disconcerting 85% plunge in net profits to just $94.5m, Fujitsu Ltd, bolstered by the acquisition of ICL Plc is putting rapidly increasing distance between itself and the other contenders for the title " world's second-biggest computer company ": some commentators illegitimately eliminate Fujitsu's semiconductor sales from the total simply because the company sells more of its chip output on the merchant market than do IBM Corp, Digital Equipment Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co, but all of <annotorg> Fujitsu </annotorg>'s $26,640m annual turnover is information technology-related -- and the company is now nearly twice the size of the $14,000m-a-year DEC, and well over a third the size of IBM; only a decade ago, IBM was more like 10 times the size of the next biggest computer manufacturer. 
Shaky multimedia start-up Tiger Media has lost its president Laura Buddine.

Should nationalized industries use the same interest rate as private firms? 
To assess the social opportunity cost of tying up resources in a project in the nationalized industries, we need to ask what would have happened to the resources had the project not been undertaken.

Unless the nationalized industries use the same interest rate as private firms, there will be misallocation of investment resources between the private and the public sector: society can gain by reallocating resources to the sector with the higher rate of return.

IBM Corp started relaxing its strict accounting practices way back in 1984, just as the company's core mainframe business began to lose its impetus, although no-one realised it at the time. 
This is the conclusion of an in-depth Wall Street Journal investigation which suggests that its moves may have served to bolster its results on a short-term basis and push problems into the future. 
The paper says that former <annot><org reading="unknown"> IBM </org></annot> chief outside auditor Donald Chandler of Price Waterhouse & Co wrote in a 1988 memo that IBM was reporting revenues that it might never realise by booking sales when products were shipped -- to its own warehouses for onward staging to customers, or to dealers who could return them. 
The report said for over 10 years, IBM has been booking immediately all the revenues from some long-term computer leases, getting a residual value guarantee from Merrill Lynch & Co to bring the total of the lease payments plus the residual value up to the 90% of the sale price that accountants regard as prudent for a sales-type lease.

The company is also taking a $415m hit for faster depreciation of software, which again underlines the deterioration in the company's perception of its mainframe business. 
IBM said that the cost of the actions will be approximately $2,100m net, on top of the $2,100m that it will take to cover the cost of the voluntary redundancies, the $4,200m total to be offset by adoption of Financial Accounting Standard 109(a), which will allow the company to write back to the profit and loss account about $1,900m in money set aside for deferred taxes. 
Including the capacity-reduction actions -- which will primarily involve closing of buildings rather than abandonment of entire sites, <annot><org reading="unknown"> IBM </org></annot> will have reduced its total manufacturing space by about 40% since 1985. 
The benefit of all this is estimated to be a saving on annual costs of about $4,000m beginning in 1993 -- but all the cost-cutting that the company already has under its belt has done no more than enable it to stand still, which is why several analysts question whether even the latest cuts will prove sufficient.

In Evans v <annotorg> Lufthansa Airlines </annotorg> (1981) NLJ 1166 the Shaw v Vauxhall Motors guidance was applied to this type of application.

MICROSOFT PLEDGES TO INVESTIGATE MS-DOS 6.0 REPORTS 
Despite anecdotal reports of serious bugs in Microsoft Corp's new MS-DOS 6.0, PC Week Labs says it has been unable to reproduce in a controlled laboratory environment any of the data-threatening errors specifically attributed to MS-DOS 6.0 or its DoubleSpace component, adding that it believes that many of the reported data-destroying errors can be attributed to the sudden introduction of SMARTDRV, the MS-DOS and Windows cache program, onto previously uncached systems -- SMARTDRV caches disk writes, and any sudden power-down can cause unrecoverable file and disk errors -- but be that as it may, <annot><org reading="unknown"> Microsoft </org></annot> is taking the reports of data loss sufficiently seriously that it has pledged to do whatever it takes to track down and purge any serious flaws, although it has found none, and InfoWorld reported it found several problems, including one in the DoubleSpace data compression -- but Microsoft said two of its engineers looked into but could not replicate the problems InfoWorld saw.

Although Raytheon has guaranteed to purchase the major sub-assemblies, fuselage and wings from the main <annot><org reading="unknown"> BAe </org></annot> Airbus plant at Broughton, there is no guarantee of continued assembly by the 600 staff of Corporate Jets. 
The fear is that when Raytheon completes its overall review of the Corporate Jets business it may move the entire operation to the US.

An Intel Corp observer says the company is really competing against system makers IBM Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co, Digital Equipment Corp and Sun Microsystems Inc, and maybe MIPS Technologies Inc: his point is that Intel is bound to a policy of moving more and more of the system onto its chips until all the hardware vendor will be adding is a couple of leads; he also says <annotorg> Intel </annotorg> is very conscious of the potentials of the computer and communications tie-up and is dreaming of a worldwide network data repository under its thumb; strategic alliances came up and so did the name AT&T Co, and the words " information utility ".

Thus the merger of Fiat/Lancia and Alfa would increase Fiat's existing dominance of the Italian car market and be liable to lead to an increase in monopoly power. 
Critics of Fiat therefore argued that its bid could be seen as a defensive move to improve its domestic position and, perhaps more importantly, to prevent a competitor from obtaining Italian production facilities, which in the long run could pose a threat to Fiat. 
Although there was opposition to the Fiat-Alfa deal from some trade unionists who were concerned at the possible job losses caused by rationalisation after a merger, the Italian government was subjected to considerable political pressure of a nationalistic nature to support the Fiat bid -- pressure similar to that which forced the British government to cancel the talks between Ford and Austin Rover -- and eventually rejected the <annot><org reading="unknown"> Ford </org></annot> overtures in favour of an " all Italian solution ".

Last Wednesday's heavy New York papers, the Times and the Wall Street Journal, devoted acres of newsprint to the disastrous turn taken in the tide of IBM Corp's affairs -- but alongside, IBM still ran a chirpy RS/6000 ad with a picture of computer-generated bubbles, with a blurb entitled The Computer That Made This Picture is Also Making History.

The US administration on Oct. 11, 1989, formally notified Congress of its intention to sell to Saudi Arabia 315 M1-A1 battlefield tanks at a cost variously reported as between US$700 million and $3,000 million, and the Financial Times of Oct. 3 reported that Saudi Arabia, which was seeking to purchase a total of some 600 tanks to replace its current ageing fleet, was " close to signing a deal " with a Brazilian defence contractor, Engesa, for the acquisition of 300 light weight Osorio tanks. 
Payments difficulties over Al-Yamamah deal with UK 
The Financial Times of Nov. 27, 1989, reported that the United Kingdom was seeking to arrange a £2,000 million bank loan to finance Saudi Arabia's continued purchase of British arms under the massive Al-Yamamah arms deal first agreed in 1985 and expanded in 1988 [ see pp. 34012; 36312; 36952 ], chiefly involving the purchase of Tornado fighter-bombers built by British Aerospace (<annot><org reading="unknown"> BAe </org></annot>) and currently estimated to be worth some £20,000 million. 
The deal was being financed by Saudi oil shipments, and the cash shortfall had resulted from weak oil prices.

At present, everything that Hewlett-Packard is doing looks right: it has won itself a reputation of taking better care of its customers, an example being the way it is not forcing its MPE users to move to Unix, instead letting them migrate at their own pace. 
In Unix, it has succeeded in creating the impression that it has far more of the management, security and support capabilities in place than any of its competitors, and while this may not be entirely valid, time and again in the computer industry, winning the perception is nine tenths of the battle: in the 1970s, it was universally acknowledged among the cognoscenti that Burroughs Corp had by far the best mainframe architecture and operating software, but that did nothing to prevent the vast majority of its users migrating to <annot><org reading="unknown"> IBM </org></annot> over time.

ICL -- which also wants a <annot><org reading="unknown"> Sun </org></annot> port for its own purposes -- will initially have the product to itself, but other ports will follow, and other TP monitors, such as Top End and Encina, are also being considered " although we pretty much have our hands full at the moment ", says Nierenberg.

An extension of Accell/SQL 2.2, Accell/TP runs with the Informix, Ingres, Oracle and Sybase databases, as well as Unify Corp's own Unify 2000 database, integrates with Unix System Labs' Tuxedo transaction processing monitor, and conforms to X/Open two-phase commit and XA database standards. 
Unify president and founder Nicolas Nierenberg says Accell/TP is now being demonstrated to customers, will go into beta-testing within the next few months, and will be generally available during the first quarter of next year. 
ICL -- which also wants a <annotorg> Sun </annotorg> port for its own purposes -- will initially have the product to itself, but other ports will follow, and other TP monitors, such as Top End and Encina, are also being considered " although we pretty much have our hands full at the moment ", says Nierenberg. 
The product is needed because Tuxedo is so hard to programme, and interfaces have previously had to be written using C. Accell/TP allows you to get to the functionality of Tuxedo using procedure calls.
