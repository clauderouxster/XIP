The US Federal Trade Commission is reviewing a new staff report on the anti-trust allegations against Microsoft Corp, but a decision on the matter probably is still weeks away, lawyers familiar with the case told the Wall Street Journal: with a two-to-two vote in February, the commission didn't accept staff recommendations to seek an injunction preventing the company from using its market power to engage in allegedly unfair competitive practices; after the tied vote, the commissioners asked for more information in an effort to resolve the deadlock; the status report, which was delivered to commissioners last week, provides additional support for the staff's call for action.

The influx of cheap Arab labour from the occupied territories allowed the Israeli economy to expand rapidly after 1967, pushing unskilled Jewish labour into higher grade work. 
The shift in the labour pattern significantly reduced the tensions between the European and non-European and largely unskilled Jewish elements in Israel which during the 1960s was becoming a serious social and political issue since the latter grew faster demographically than the former. 
Overall, <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="underspecified between OFF, POP"> Israel </location></annot>'s absorption of over 100,000 Palestinians as casual labourers created a feeling of weakness and helplessness in the Palestinian community, and of success and power within the Israeli economy.

On Nov. 15 it ordered the French car group Renault to repay some F 12,000 million (approximately equivalent to USdollars 1,900 million as Nov. 13, 1989) of state aid received since 1988, having already demanded the repayment of F 111,200,000 from the Peugeot group in respect of a cheap credit deal.

If suitable genes for gluten production could be added to British varieties, or if the genes in British wheat were made to produce more or better gluten, imports would be saved and farmers would get a higher price for a better quality wheat.

The economic and social instability of Eastern Europe seems likely to be a major political factor over the medium-term future, but it is far from being the only element of instability in the present world system. 
Thus, nationalism has re-emerged also in Western Europe, in neo-fascist and populist forms, directed frequently against immigrants and potential immigrants (and immigration itself is in part a consequence of the extreme poverty of some Third World countries, and of the economic decline of Eastern Europe). 
Uncontrolled population growth, the continuing deterioration of the environment, the economic depression in the major capitalist countries, the shift of economic power from the US to Japan and the European Community (and particularly to <annot><location reading="literal"> Germany </location></annot>) and the growing tensions between these three centres, the increasing disparity of wealth between the poorer developing countries and the industrial nations, are all potent sources of social dislocation and instability. 
Far from having reached the sunny uplands of history, as some have claimed, therefore, human beings will perhaps have to face, even in the present generation, new trials on a bleak and inhospitable mountainside.

While many run-of-the-mill domestic issues may be left open for policy debate and political influence to decide, in every liberal democratic country the core executive monopolizes major issues such as defence and foreign policy resolution, or critical economic decisions (the dark or secret side of the state). 
For example, in <annot><location reading="literal"> Britain </location></annot> successive Conservative and Labour prime ministers from 1948 though to 1979 developed the British nuclear deterrent in virtually complete secrecy, with no parliamentary or media discussion until decisions were accomplished facts, and even without disclosing decisions made to most of their fellow Cabinet ministers (Freedman, 1980). 
Some democratic elite theorists have argued that a much wider group of elected political leaders play political or policy direction roles than the power elite conception implies.

Certainly no generalisation can be made except that the successful diffusion of the knowledge of soil conserving practices is often one essential change that is required -- even although the knowledge may be possessed by some cultivators already. 
Usually, as this book will argue, successful agricultural extension is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for implanting sound conservation practices (see Thrupp (1981) for a case study of the (jaded) peasant view of conservation in Costa Rica). 
Solutions to population pressure, differentiation, and declining productivity through soil exhaustion and erosion, which lie outside the agricultural sector altogether, do not offer the same promise as they did in Japan, the <annot><location reading="literal"> USA </location></annot> or the United Kingdom during their industrial revolutions. 
Outmigration to cities in search of menial jobs or part-time work in nearby plantations provide remittances and reduce food demand, but these activities also reduce labour availability and have been responsible for the collapse of old-established terracing systems in the Middle and near East, particularly Yemen and also in the Andean part of Peru and Colombia.

Since independence in 1980 some 52,000 peasant farmers had been resettled on 3,000,000 hectares purchased from the 4,000-strong white farming community, but whites still owned 12,000,000 hectares (40 per cent of <annot><location reading="literal"> Zimbabwe </location></annot>'s total land area).

From one analysis of data for 25 developing countries, it was determined that, if all children were born at least two years apart, about one in five infant deaths would be averted. 
According to another report that was based upon essentially the same data, the spacing of second and higher order births at least two years apart would reduce infant mortality by 10 per cent and the death rate of children aged 1-4 years by 21 per cent. 
In traditional societies where prolonged breastfeeding has been the custom, the advantages of lengthy spacing are widely recognized though, as in <annot><location reading="literal"> Kenya </location></annot>, the tradition has begun to fade among some peoples along with the advance of modernization. 
Because the ability of breastfeeding to sustain the period of infecundity due to amenorrhoea over long periods depends, inter alia, upon the frequency and intensity of suckling, and in the light of the generalized view that lengthy spacing is essential to child survival, in most African and some other societies, breastfeeding is reinforced by abstinence.

To perform the same task on the other side of the world, the following eleven major seas -- all on the continental side of the Andesite Line, all secure on their own tectonic plates -- need to be included (we are proceeding northwards and clockwise, from a point somewhere south of New Zealand): the Tasman, Solomon, Coral, Bismarck, Philippine, South China, East China and Yellow Seas, the Seas of Japan and of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea. 
There are lesser seas which must also be included, in particular the fifteen around the islands of the East Indian archipelago: the Sulu, Celebes and Molucca Seas, the Gulf of Tomini, the Halmahera, Ceram, Banda, Arafura (which may or may not contain the Gulf of Carpentaria, depending on which atlas is used), Timor and Flores Seas, the Gulf of Boni, the Bali Sea, the Makassar Strait, the Java and Savu Seas; and there is the Gulf of Thailand, the Strait of Malacca, the <annot><location reading="literal"> Singapore Strait </location></annot> and the Inland Sea of Japan. 
Add to this the Great Australian Bight and the Bass Strait -- for if we did not, it would be difficult to regard Australia as a Pacific nation, which would indeed be a foolish error -- and we have arrived at what seems the most appropriate and comprehensive definition of our goal: one oceanic bloc, twenty-four marginal Seas (of which one is designated Inland), five Gulfs, four Straits, one Canadian Confusion and one Australian Bight.

the English working class ... can never do anything decisive here in England until it separates its policy with regard to Ireland in the most definite way from the policy of the ruling class, until it not only makes common cause with the Irish, but actually takes the initiative in dissolving the Union established in 1801, and replacing it by a federal relationship. 
And, indeed, this must be done, not as a matter of sympathy with Ireland, but as a demand made in the interest of the English proletariat. 
Or again: It is in the direct and absolute interest of the English working class to get rid of their present connection with <annotloc> Ireland </annotloc> ... 
For a long time, I believed that it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by English working class ascendancy ...

This is illustrated by Lijphart's (1984, 1989) analyses of types of democratic political systems, which was initially based on two dimensions reflecting different aspects of majoritarian and consensual rule. 
Fitting different political systems into this schema empirically involved defining the dimensions on the following variables. 
For the first dimension, five used were: whether executive power is concentrated (as in the British Cabinet) or shared (as in the Swiss Federal Council, in which all parties are represented); whether the executive dominates (as in the UK), or shares power with the legislature (as in the United States); whether there is a two or a multi-party system; whether parties are divided on one political dimension (e.g. the typical left-right division in Great Britain) or several (as in <annot><location reading="literal"> The Netherlands </location></annot>); and whether elections use plurality or proportional representation procedures.

The Versailles peace conference acceded to Japan's takeover of the former German concessions, but the Chinese refused to sign any treaty which did not return them to China, and Japan remained in occupation. 
At the 1921-2 Washington Conference Japan agreed to restore Chinese sovereignty in Shandong, but only in return for Chinese confirmation of Japan's economic privileges there.

If this is what the Common European Home stands for, so enthusiastically embraced by the Germans on the occasion of Gorbachev's visit to Bonn in June 1989, then it is difficult to think of a more decisive rejection of the values of the Atlantic alliance.

He suggested that each family type is linked to particular ideology.

However, it was only in 1929 that a separate Secretariat for Latin America was formed within the Comintern's Moscow administration; hitherto relations with Latin American Communist parties had been handled through a " Latin Secretariat " which also covered Southern Europe. 
The potential role of Latin America in any conflict between the <annot><location reading="literal"> United States </location></annot> and Great Britain had become a main concern of Comintern policy by 1928, when its Sixth Congress was held. 
For the first time, Latin America was significantly represented and its revolutionary potential discussed, a development also partly attributable to events in Nicaragua where Augusto Sandino was raising a nationalist banner to challenge US imperialism.

In a script worthy of an Oliver Stone conspiracy movie, officials of the government trying permanently to corner Noriega emerged to give the accused his best character evidence. 
A former chief of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, an organisation regarded as a firm enemy of Noriega, swore to tell the whole truth and proceeded to laud Noriega for his " long-standing support " and " personal commitment " to the drug wars. 
The US prosecutors painted the accused as " a crooked cop ", co-operating for $4.6 million (£2.6 million) with the Medellin cocaine cartel by shielding US-bound drug shipments as they moved through <annot><location reading="literal"> Panama </location></annot>. 
But Mr Bush's old agency, the CIA, suddenly produced the trial's only real, live agent to blow apart a key assertion: that Noriega had fallen out with the cartel after his troops destroyed a state-of-the-art cocaine laboratory in Panama.

These circumstances are themselves historically changing, and in response to the changes new social movements and parties may emerge within the established political system, as did the socialist parties, and later the communist and fascist parties, in Europe.

In the <annot><location reading="literal"> US </location></annot>, for example, where the socialist party failed to establish itself as a major party after a fairly rapid growth in the first decade of this century, it has long been argued that the presidential system is a major obstacle to the development of third parties, and undoubtedly these constitutional factors have been important; but it is clear that many other social and economic characteristics of the US have had a preponderant influence in determining the absence of a large-scale independent socialist movement or party there (Sombart, 1906; Laslett and Lipset, 1974). 
In some European countries with a two-party system, in which the parties have traditionally been closely associated with the major classes in capitalist society, changes in the class structure -- such as were examined in Chapter 1 -- have made possible the emergence or revival of " centre " parties, and changes of this kind may in due course have an impact upon the electoral system itself.

But while the exact timing of this pattern of events was unusual, the return of the overall pattern in the early 1980s comes as little surprise to some researchers, who have been warning for several years that a new drought cycle was due.

But even if it is not exactly this scheme, it is certain that any global agreement will have to be supported by a mechanism which allows the developing countries to pollute more while they catch up with developed countries which are simultaneously reducing their emissions. 
Rich countries are not going to accept proposals from India and the Group of 77 countries for an environmental aid fund which would be administered by the developing nations, but transfers of technology and financial aid will be part of the eventual package. 
Rajiv Gandhi's call when still India's prime minister at the September 1989 Non-Aligned summit for an $18 million fund based on contributions equivalent to 0.1 per cent of GDP by UN members has the support in principle of the influential Mrs Gro Brundtland of <annot><location reading="literal"> Norway </location></annot>. 
The argument will be harsh, and if the threat of disaster is vivid enough to bring about agreement, it may be that nations will find that, in the interest of common purpose, they are little by little surrendering the sovereignty of which Sir Ian Lloyd spoke.

For example, if the rapid erosion from a cliff edge is feeding sediment to a low-lying area nearby, then the low-lying area may be placed in danger if the cliff erosion is interrupted. 
According to Dr John Pethick, a coastal geomorphologist at Hull University, the best solution is to avoid building in the worst-affected areas, and to compensate landowners for loss of land to the sea. 
The compensation should be arranged at a European level, because sediment washed from the UK's east coast can end up strengthening natural sea defences in Belgium, the <annot><location reading="literal"> Netherlands </location></annot> and Germany. 
Global warming is contributing to rising sea levels around the world, according to Pethick, at the rate of about one millimetre a year.

In the year beginning November 1917 National Service Medical Boards conducted nearly 2.5 million medical examinations in <annotloc> Great Britain </annotloc>: of every nine men, only three were perfectly fit and healthy, while two were on a definitely " unfirm plane " of health and strength, three were incapable of undergoing more than a very moderate degree of physical exertion and the remaining one was a chronic invalid. 
The influenza epidemic of 1918/19 seemed to confirm a national state of unfitness: more than 151,000 deaths were recorded, the highest relative to population for any epidemic since the cholera outbreak of 1849.

The study confirmed that acid rain was caused mainly by emissions from coal-fired power stations and stated that the huge reserves of sulphur built up in the soil meant that many Scottish and Scandinavian lakes would suffer the effects of acid rain for decades even if sulphur dioxide emissions were cut radically.

In fact Buzzell and Gale (1987) say that the PIMS data establish that quality is the most important factor in success.

Even in the decade following the 1973 oil crisis, official unemployment rates have never exceeded 3 per cent, compared to the double figure levels in the EEC or the US. 
International comparisons of unemployment rates are as notoriously difficult as measures of income distribution, and the Labour Ministry in Japan, as in other countries, has its own idiosyncratic style of creative statistical construction. 
There are studies by Japanese labour economists which suggest that if the <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> US </location></annot> definition of unemployment were used in Japan, the unemployment percentage would at least double (Tominomori 1985).

Russia has welcomed the Korean contribution of experts, equipment and funds to finance the survey, expected to cost US$400,000, but has said it will have to continue dumping because it lacks the facilities or funds to process the waste on shore.

Although <annot><location reading="literal"> South Korea </location></annot> recorded a growth rate of 9.1 per cent in 1990, this was achieved largely through a boom in the construction industry manufactured by a government-backed residential building programme which aimed to construct 2,500,000 new housing units in 1988-92. 
Increased levels of domestic consumption (including expenditure on luxury items), however, suggested that a more fundamental shift was under way whereby the dynamic of the South Korean economy was changing from one which was export-led to one based upon domestic demand.

Naturally, the facility required ancillary staffing in all areas, as well as a teacher as Head of Resources with a curriculum development brief.

To my taste, none of these have a particularly distinctive flavour, but the quality in texture is immediately obvious. 
The best of these sausages are loose or in jars -- I find that the necessary temperatures achieved during canning tend to make the sausages rather fatty and slimy in texture. 
Garlic sausages are made in many countries, notably France, Germany and <annotloc> Poland </annotloc>. 
I sell most of the French variety, which is a small sausage with a strong flavour but a coarse and fatty texture.

A museum of economic botany was opened in 1847, and in later decades Kew played a vital role in the spread of useful plants around the British empire. 
In the United States a national botanical garden was founded to exploit the seeds and plants brought back by a Pacific exploration expedition under Charles Wilkes in the years 1838-42. 
At the same time the <annot><location reading="literal"> US </location></annot> Patent Office became interested in the possibility of using tropical plants to revive the agriculture of the southern states. 
The Patent Office also promoted the use of chemistry in soil analysis, seeing this as a means of preventing the exhaustion of nutrients.

Bush said that he would be willing to lift US sanctions once the Pretoria government had fulfilled conditions including the total lifting of the state of emergency. 
Earlier, Mandela had been forthright in his criticism of US support for the Angolan rebel movement UNITA [ see p. 37523 ].

As Thomas (1963) wrote, people were affected by trains to some extent even in the most remote parts of England during the latter half of the nineteenth and early years of the twentieth centuries.

The major reason given for the closure of railway lines and stations was that the 1950s modernization plan for the railways had had little effect on stemming an ever-rising deficit in running costs.

But Mr Rafsanjani is exposed to accusations that he is departing from the policies set out by the leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, and may have seized on the Mujahideen attacks to demonstrate that he is not selling out the imam's legacy.
