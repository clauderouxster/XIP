This week, in the inaugural Fiji International Sevens, the Scots will be able to devote further studies to the Australians and get their first glimpse of Tonga, against whom they are also drawn in the Hong Kong Sevens.

Underwood's recent retirement from the international scene as England's most capped player highlights the distinguished contribution made to English rugby, both on and off the field, by the RAF. 
It is particularly fitting that Underwood should have chosen to step down in a year when the president of the Rugby Football Union is Peter Yarranton, himself a former England player and RAF pilot, who will be at today's game. 
Underwood's position as England's leading try-scorer, with 35 to his credit, has a two-fold RAF connection because when he scored against <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="ORG, sports, rugby team"> Ireland </location></annot> in 1990 the record he overtook had previously been held by another RAF pilot and winger, Cyril Lowe, who totalled 18 between 1913 and 1923 when winning 25 consecutive caps.

Stores, breweries, leisure stocks, banks and insurance shares were in the vanguard of the rises and at the close of the trading session a bumper £6bn had flowed in. 
The strong upward movement was triggered by a bullish forecast from the CBI -- the bosses' union -- that the economy will start to emerge gradually from the recession in the Spring of next year. 
Underlying inflation, now around the 3.7% mark, is expected to slow but due to the devaluation of the pound <annotloc> UK </annotloc> exports should pick up dramatically because the price of British goods will be much cheaper abroad. 
The recent cuts in the mortgage rate -- with the cost of borrowing on homes now down to around the 7-8% level -- will also fuel a wave of spending in the high street.

The current project aims to produce and field test a French adaptation of the Nottingham Health Profile. 
In so doing, it is hoped to make a contribution to the methodology of cross-cultural research by overcoming linguistic problems involved in the translation of perceptions of health from one language to another; by identifying differences in the perceived severity of the items; and through the interpretation of cultural differences in scoring. 
It is envisaged that the successful completion of this project will provide an avenue for future collaboration in health research between France and <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="underspecified between OFF, ORG"> Britain </location></annot>.

She has had to give in over the question of chrome: and the Foreign Minister, who never struck me as being too friendly towards us, failed to get away (as he apparently hoped) with letting armed German ships through the Straits. 
But, more recently, the opening of the Second Front, together with its initial success, has sent a faint thrill of alarm through the country: and the latest utterance of Cordell Hull, which carne over the wireless yesterday, is not going to cheer things up, nor is it likely to be the last exhortation of its kind. 
To say that this sums up <annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="underspecified between OFF, POP"> Turkey </location></annot>'s attitude as a whole would nevertheless be untrue. 
Combined with their reluctance to enter the war, the Turks entertain great hopes of their army, upon which a major portion of the budget is spent: and they can not fail to recognise something ludicrous in an attitude which, at one moment, abhors the idea of fighting and at another lauds it as the noblest activity of man.

The bloodbath will plunge the nation into a new crisis -- and may wreck hopes of resumed talks on South Africa's future.

The Iranian election is seen as an opportunity for President Rafsanjani to strengthen his pragmatic policy of seeking an accommodation with the West to restore Iran's economy. 
But Mr Rafsanjani is exposed to accusations that he is departing from the policies set out by the leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, and may have seized on the Mujahideen attacks to demonstrate that he is not selling out the imam's legacy. 
<annot><location reading="metonymic" metotype="place-for-people" notes="OFF"> Britain </location></annot> has not yet received any formal demand for the extradition of the demonstrators who threw bricks at the Iranian embassy in London and smashed windows. 
There is no extradition treaty between Iran and Britain, though this does not rule out granting a request, if properly formulated.
