From 1984, the company also started extending more of the costs of new factories and other investments into future accounting periods -- in the belief that the mainframe business would pick up again and justify the move.

Russell Reynolds were to take on a not dissimilar problem when their London office headhunted Ian McGregor for British Steel in 1980.

Restraining Cartels: Article 85 and Philip Morris 
In its <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-event" notes="court case"> Philip Morris </org></annot> decision in November 1987, the Court held that all agreements for a merger where a cartel situation already existed, or might be created by the merger, were exposed to Article 85. 
The Philip Morris doctrine means that a merger may be caught by Article 85 if at least two competitors or potential competitors are involved and if the market behaviour of one or more of those concerned in the merger is likely to be influenced so as to distort competition and have an appreciable effect on trade between the Member States.

It was inevitable -- and should have been obvious to the kinds of forecasting brains that IBM could afford -- that the open systems movement would spread up from the desktop to infect first the minicomputer world and then the mainframe. 
And that means that even the AS/400 is potentially at risk, and can only continue to be a winner if IBM builds in a big discount to compensate for the fact that it is proprietary -- yet instead of recognising this vulnerability, with its incredible but consistent short-termism, the company is squeezing AS/400 users until they squeal with its software pricing on the machine. 
The AS/400 business is widely hailed as one of <annot><org reading="literal"> IBM </org></annot>'s few current successes: in fact it's a failure -- it should have won every System/36 user by now, and have won enough formerly non-IBM customers to be running at between $25,000m and $30,000m a year, not the $14,000m it is currently doing. 
And incredibly, users at the top end are still crying out for more power because IBM failed to keep its promise of increasing performance at a rate that would keep it ahead of customer demand.

There are various reasons why it might be desirable to transfer <annotorg> Target </annotorg>'s business to Newco after the acquisition. 
If this is not done and a future purchaser of the business wishes to buy assets rather than Target's shares, it will be necessary to distribute the proceeds of disposal of those assets to Newco with an onward distribution to management.

OSF TO PAY ITS WAY IN 1995 -- NEW WIDGETS FOR MOTIF 
The Open Software Foundation says it is well on course to achieving its stated aim of self-sufficiency by the end of next year (UX No 374). 
OSF turned over $55m in 1992, of which $28m came from sales of technology licences -- predominantly for the Motif graphical user interface -- the other $27m being the $4.5m a year membership dues paid by each of the six remaining founders, Digital Equipment Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co, Hitachi Ltd, IBM Corp, <annot><org reading="literal"> Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG </org></annot> and Groupe Bull SA. 
Claiming it is " going into implementation mode, " OSF believes it can double its licence revenues over the course of this year with Distributed Computing Environment technologies now coming to market and a string of new business partnerships it will establish -- see page five.

Mansell has so dominated pre-season testing in his Ford-powered Lola that he is expected to win on Sunday by the large margin familiar during his dominance of Grand Prix racing in the <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-product"> Williams Renault </org></annot> last season. 
If he does, the result will be interpreted as long-awaited proof that Formula One is the world's leading motor racing formula -- a belief given added weight by Indycar champion Michael Andretti's disastrous showing in his debut at the South African Grand Prix last weekend.

Aside from integration difficulties, OSF has also been bogged down trying to figure out how to implement a standard version of the Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (Corba), a mechanism for managing objects across distributed systems.

An alternative would therefore be to use a UK-resident Newco for the share/debenture exchange and, to circumvent the capital gains tax disadvantage of this, it could soon after the acquisition transfer its stake in Target to the partnership by way of a capital distribution, leaving it with the loan-note obligations to the vendor shareholders and the cash to meet such obligations.

This assumes that the period of Newco's ownership of shares in <annot><org reading="literal"> Target </org></annot> would be sufficiently short for there to have been no increase in their value, so that when the capital distribution takes place, there is no capital gains tax liability on the partners under s122 TCGA 1992, nor a distribution for the purposes of s209 TA 1988. 
This sort of structure could be adapted to the situation where the departing shareholders of Target are willing to accept deferred consideration (the debentures), the managers become or remain shareholders in Target and a venture capital partnership wishes to invest directly in Target.

According to Andrews, Ontos DB -- described as a component object database environment -- resides at a higher level than persistent languages such as C++ and SmallTalk or databases that are simply collections of objects that use C++ topologies rather than SQL. 
Whilst other object players such as Objectivity Inc and Object Design Inc are successfully licensing persistent language products to majors like Microsoft Corp and Sun Microsystems Inc (UX No 405), it is only a matter of time, Andrews argues, before they no longer need the services of third parties. 
The likes of <annot><org reading="literal"> Microsoft </org></annot> and Sun will soon learn to exploit object technology by developing new generations of products that could price small object players out of the market. 
Similarly, databases offered by the current crop of object firms like Versant, Objectivity and Servio Logic, could easily have their market chewed up by the mainstream relational players like Sybase, Ingres and Oracle, which nearly every day are claiming more and more functionality for their products, like inheritance, C++ and objects.

Thus (presumably unfairly) the UK " would be more affected by this part of the Directive than other states. " 
Why this should be an objection to the control of pollution from nitrates is not clear, and it also overlooks the government's own study commissioned from Sir William Halcrow and Partners. 
The Halcrow report showed that, while overall some 30 per cent of UK drinking water comes from aquifers, this varies from 6 per cent in Wales to 74 per cent in <annotorg> Southern Water </annotorg>'s region.

IBM CHARGES FOR SOFTWARE MEDIA

The charge is intended to cover the cost of creating the stacked tapes, media, documentation, and the shipping charges -- but $580 on a 1,600 bpi half-inch reel tape, $375 on a 120 quarter inch cartridge, $195 on a 525 sounds exorbitant.

On other fronts, too, Niki, was proving a leader, the sort of senior driver whose participation in a team was greater than that of a mere employee, and it is to the merit of Ron Dennis and McLaren that Lauda was allowed to play a wider role. 
Here, for instance, there is no doubt that Niki was of substantial help in closing the deal which brought McLaren the hugely successful TAG/Porsche engine, developed by Porsche but financed and sponsored by Mansour Ojjeh, the son of the head of Techniques d'Avant Garde, a French high-tech company with a substantial role in the development of weaponry. 
Because FI, in the wake of <annot><org reading="literal"> Renault </org></annot>, was shifting towards the turbo engine and because McLaren was beginning to develop the TAG/ Porsche engine, 1982 was something of a transitional year at the team and both Niki and his team-mate John Watson suffered in the results table, Watson actually finishing ahead of Niki in the championship, the first time he had ever been upstaged within his own team. 
The year belonged to Keke Rosberg at Williams -- though Ferrari's Didier Pironi might well have won the championship had it not been for his grave accident in the rain at Hockenheim.

In a Commons statement on Nov. 30, 1989, Nicholas Ridley, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, said that the government took the view that the concessions were consistent with the terms of EC approval and that these arrangements were the least which were necessary to secure the successful transfer of the Rover Group to the private sector. 
The Labour Party spokesperson on trade and industry on Dec. 7, 1989, published letters leaked to him which principally disclosed that Lord Young of Graffham, Trade and Industry Secretary at the time of the Rover sale, had offered to BAe chairman Roland Smith a variety of means by which both the government and <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-members"> BAe </org></annot> could avoid parliamentary and EC scrutiny, relating to the date on which the purchase price of Rover would be paid.

NEW YORK. 
In an initiative that is bound to influence the practice of corporate funding of contemporary art exhibitions in the United States the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation announced last month that it will award grants totalling $500,000 to ten different museums. 
The <annotorg> AT&T </annotorg> programme, called " New Art: New Visions ", describes itself as the first corporate effort in the U.S. to help promote recently created work by living artists, especially the work of women and " artists of colour ", the term now used to refer to artists of the many racial minority groups vying for exhibition space and for a dwindling pool of public and corporate funds. 
The exhibitions in question, each receiving a challenge grant ranging from $30,000 to $50,000, are located in Long Beach (California), Atlanta, Houston, Columbus (Ohio), New York, Chicago, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and Boston.

The purpose test in s13A(2) (a) must continue to be satisfied when interest is paid by the managers on their shares, but the " control by management " test need not be. 
For the other conditions that need to be satisfied for management to obtain interest relief, reference should be made to s360. 
Briefly these can be summarised as follows: (1) The management individuals must take out loans; an overdraft is not sufficient. (2) The loans must be to defray expenditure incurred in acquiring ordinary share capital of a close company complying with s13A(2) as described above, or in lending to such a close company where the money loaned is used wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its business or the business of any of its associated companies provided the latter are also close companies satisfying the conditions of s13A(2). (3) When interest is paid on the manager's loan, Newco must continue to comply with s13A(2)--this means it must continue to satisfy the relevant purpose test rather than that it should continue to remain a close company; in the case of a purchase of shares in <annot><org reading="literal"> Target </org></annot>, the reason why Newco should be close after the institutions commit to invest is to ensure that institutions and management can invest at the same time and that, at that time, Newco is both close and satisfies the relevant purpose test, ie already controls Target; management can not commit Newco to acquiring Target until the institutions have committed to funding Newco, and once they have so committed the institutions are likely to control Newco under s416, so a structure is needed whereby management also controls Newco at this point. 
(4) Each manager must hold at least one ordinary share in Newco and work for more than half his time in the " management or conduct of the company " or an associated company; alternatively he must own more than 5% of the ordinary share capital of Newco (the " material interest " test); for these purposes, the shareholdings of any associate of an individual manager are aggregated with his holding; " management or conduct of the company " (rather than its business) connotes the function of directors and senior managers, so other employees and middle management will not be able to obtain relief, since they are unlikely to have a sufficient holding in Newco to satisfy the material interest test.

It will also help it to deflect the spotlight trained on it and its relationship with Virgin Atlantic.

NT won't support SMP until version 2, still some 18 months out in any case, and Microsoft hasn't yet decided what it'll do for that stuff yet.

In 1966, solid state computers, developed under the direction of Drs Hanzo Omi and Toshio Ikeda, were exported for the first time. 
And by 1972, <annotorg> Fujitsu </annotorg> had reached technological parity with IBM. 
What was needed was a continual flow of information regarding IBM's product and marketing plans, which is readily available from a legion of professional IBM watchers who demand, and receive, hefty sums for analyses of future IBM strategies.
