This directory contains the concept-matching grammar for detecting Pubmed abstracts that describe results indicating major change in biological knowledge.


3 types of analyses can be carried out:

1) Analyse 1 sentence: echo "This is a paradigm shift." | bin/txtparse > output_file
2) Analyse a retrieved collection of Pubmed abstracts in xml files following the structure in test/text.xml: bin/abstracts.xml > output_file
3) Retrieve abstracts from Pubmed as described in doc/use
