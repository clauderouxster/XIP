<awapara>ABSTRACT</awapara>
<awapara>This paper presents a theoretical grounding and a conceptual proposal aimed at providing support in the initial stages of sustained behavioural change. We explore the role that learning analytics and/or open learner models can have in supporting life-long learners to enhance their food literacy through a more informed curation process of relevant-content. This approach grounds on a behavioural change perspective that identifies i) knowledge, ii) attitudes, and iii) self-efficacy as key factors that will directly and indirectly affect future decisions and agency of life-long learners concerning their own health. The paper offers some possible avenues to start organising efforts towards the use of learning analytics to enhance awareness in terms of: knowledge curation, knowledge sharing and knowledge certainty. The paper aims at triggering discussion about the type of data and presentation mechanisms that may help life-long learners set a stronger basis for behavioural change in the subsequent stages.  </awapara>

<awapara>1. INTRODUCTION</awapara>
<awapara>The proliferation of mobile devices and internet access has provided the means for individuals and communities to have access to a wide range of information. However, the types and quality of these sources can vary widely, and can often be contradictory or overwhelming. When a regular user finds interesting articles, he or she can save it for later use. However, many times it is hard to keep track of interesting content as time passes and, more important, to interrelate and make sense of a number of content sources around a common topic. A number of web content curation tools (also known as social bookmarking tools) are popular solutions for this problem since they commonly allow collaboratively annotating, archiving and bookmarking webpages.&#xA0;These may facilitate the organisation of content, information and knowledge for lifelong learning or for researching about particular topics. However, these solutions do not necessarily make evident to people how knowledge is individually/collaborative built or the meta-information about the sources of the information that could enhance their certainty on such information (e.g. showing if most webpages that are being curated correspond to blog posts rather than evidence-based articles, or whether they include references to scientific papers, media reports, journals, etc). </awapara>
<awapara>In this paper, we explore the positive role that learning analytics and/or open learner models can have in supporting lifelong learners in performing a more informed curation process of relevant content. We aim to achieve this by enhancing learners&#x2019; awareness in three areas: the knowledge curation process; aspects of their collaborative learning process and knowledge sharing; and the types of sources, which can enhance knowledge trust or mistrust.</awapara>
<awapara>Searching and curating information from the Internet have been increasingly identified as a popular source for people seeking information about how to take care of their own health [7; 20]. Users commonly use search engines and visit multiple websites to find information [11]. However, information overload [15] and lack of credibility indicators [7] have been reported as important factors that can lead to a higher degree of uncertainty and misguidance. Moreover, the majority of people do not consistently check the source and date of the health information found online [11]. Another recent movement aimed at raising awareness about personal wellbeing is quantifying different aspects  of a person&#x2019;s daily activity using self-trackers [8]. However, these technologies have shown considerable limitations in sustained usage [21] (e.g. users have shown levels of long-term engagement using smart wearables). As a result, learning about individuals&#x2019; best practices to promote and maintain their own health can be very challenging without community support or effective technological guidance, or both. Moreover, it makes it harder for an individual to gain the knowledge necessary to make initial progress towards a sustained behaviour change. We illustrate the value of our approach towards supporting awareness in this context. </awapara>
<awapara>We present a theoretical grounding and a conceptual proposal aimed at providing support in the initial stages of sustained behavioural change for the particular case of food literacy support. In this paper, we use the term food literacy to refer to the individual or collective understanding about food and nutrition that can empower people to manage their own health choices [28]. Our approach is grounded in a behavioural change perspective that identifies i) knowledge, ii) attitudes, and iii) self-efficacy as key factors that will directly and indirectly affect future decisions and agency of life-long learners concerning their own health.</awapara>
<awapara>The rest of the paper presents first, the theoretical grounding for the application of learning analytics and learner modelling for collaborative content curation. Next, we define the context of food literacy and behavioural change, before presenting our proposed conceptual approach along with some initial learning analytics ideas. We conclude with a discussion of future avenues of this project. </awapara>
