The proliferation and prominence of social media in contemporary Australia has stimulated discussion regarding the relationship between social media and the law. In particular, some academics have considered whether social media could be used to address wavering public confidence in the judiciary, which is often construed as an autonomous institution disconnected from the public. Drawing upon the scholarship, this paper will argue that Australian court staffshould consider using social media to increase confidence in the judiciary. It will suggest that the courts can achieve this increased public confidence through using social media to enhance their transparency, educate the public about court operations, and explain the legal rationale behind contentious decisions. However, this paper will also reason that the courts need to exercise caution when using social media. The court staff managing social media profiles must ensure that the posted content is reaching the general public, and does not undermine the integrity of the judiciary.Ultimately, this paper will conclude that although the use of social media can be challenging for the courts, the increased public confidence in the judiciary that it can yield is needed.




The vital process of discovery in litigation is implicated by numerous burdens which infringes the courts' and legal practitioners' ability to uphold the administration of justice. Discovery involves an exchange of a list of documents between the parties to a case, which are relevant to the issues in dispute. The Honourable Justice Keane articulates the fundamental problems associated with discovery in, The early identification of issues. These include conflicting lawyerly responsibilities to the client and the court, coupled with the extensive processing of documentation, further complicated by the growth of technology, consequently causing time-consuming court proceedings and excessive costs to litigants. This essay will explore these concerning issues with close reference to Keane's article, in addition to, Justice Sackville's judgement in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd [ 2007 ] (' Seven Network'), and Justice Allsop's judgement in Palavi v Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd [ 2011 ] (' Palavi'). It will  further consider the benefits and constraints of the early identification of issues in court proceedings, and pre - hearing conferences as potentialsolutions to these problems. They seek to alleviate some burdens imposed by discovery in litigation to enable more just, quick and cheap dispute resolution.




Court-ordered mediation is a method used to expedite matters in the civil law system. Often the use of this particular alternative dispute resolution (ADR) method has positive results and sees matters resolved outside of court. The mediators themselves who preside over these mediations are often appointed by the court and can be court officers. Court officers includes judges and registrars, and in regards to tribunals, commissioners. This essay will specificallylook at the judges and registrars acting as mediators in court - ordered mediations.
Negativity surrounds the use of court officers as mediators. The biggest concern of the public and some legal commentators is the risk of the compromise of the integrity and impartiality of the judicial system. However, this essay will argue and demonstrate the advantages of using court officers as mediator's verses external candidates. Court officers are learned in the law and the process of the attainment of justice, and by implying that impartiality cannot exist then there is an emplacement that these court officers cannot be impartial in their primary roles as registrars and judges. In fact, greater judicial involvement may increase the resolution of disputes at an early stage, thus un - clogging growing court lists. Further , it can be inferred that by practical experience in our courts in which judges have acted in this capacity for some time now, without any detriment, and with evident benefit, that the practice of court officers as mediators provides a persuasive argument.




In recent  years the institutional landscape of the Australian judicial system has undergone a significant transformation. Specifically , there is an emerging focus on alternative dispute resolution as a substitute to litigation to foster the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in dispute. Accordingly, court referred mediation has become commonplace in Australia. Justice  Street raises concerns regarding court officers conducting such mediations, arguing that this practice risks public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of our judicial system. This essay willfocus on court - annexed mediation conducted by registrars and judges. While Street's complaint falls short in a landscape where registrar led mediation has become routine, issues remain surrounding judicial mediation. Though both practices are reflected in Federal and State Court legislation, the public's perception of the traditional role of a judge remains at odds with core aspects of the mediation process. Importantly , the integrity of our judicial system must not be compromised in fact or by matter of perception and for this reason judicial mediation should not be encouraged.




The term 'discovery' is used to refer to the various ways in which one party to litigation is able to obtain information and documents held by other parties. It has several benefits such as enabling parties to determine the issues in disputes, assessing outcomes, including encouraging settlement. Despite these advantages, vast quantities of documents acquired through discovery are submitted to courts and have become the very antithesis of its purposes. This issue concerns judges as Hon Keane states that:
The common experience of many judges with long involvement in commercial disputes, even of the most complex kind, is that by the end of the trial process there will usually be, at most, a dozen material documents.
His Honour also expresses that 'judges need the information presented to them reduced'.
This essay examines the problem of voluminous documents in courts and explores whether the present rules, that govern discovery, will assist in minimising the amount of information submitted to judges. It then identifies that non-involvement of senior lawyers and abuses of process are the main causes of this issue.
Finally, it suggests two possible solutions to resolve the problem. It argues that adopting the 'buffet' approach, which is imposing a fine upon senior lawyers, will decrease the large numbers of documents in courts. It also argues that setting a page limit on documents is another way to eliminate the problem.




In recent years Australian magistrates and courts have attempted to respond to the demand for litigation to be handled with greater efficiency, following discontent with increasing costs and delays. The development of case management principles, both in statute and common law, marked a significant transformation of the judicial role with judges becoming more engaged in the litigation process. This transformation has paved the way for the increasing interaction between the courts and 'Alternative Dispute Resolution' (ADR) processes, notably mediation.
This essay  will evaluate the argument made by Sir Laurence Street that 'the role of a mediator is wholly inappropriate for a court officer' and consider the impact of judicial mediation upon the integrity and impartiality of the judicial system.This evaluation limits the term' court officer' to the judiciary and registrars.
In section  II, this essay will outline the fundamental characteristics of mediation and the role of a mediator. Section III reviews the traditional features of the judicial role and power. In section IV it will be demonstrated that the judicialrole is not static, using the examples of the development of case management principles and court - annexed mediation. Section  V assesses arguments in favour and against judicial mediation and deliberates the compatibility of roles. Section IV contemplates the future relationship between the courts and mediation and proposes structural solutions to the identified issues.
This essay  will ultimately conclude that the sentiments espoused by Street represent a conservative view on the issue of judicial mediation and that the increasing engagement of the judiciary with the litigation process indicates a likely increase in the occurrence of judicial mediation.




According to the 2011 Article, 'Judicial Mediation in Australia' written by The Honourable Justice P A Bergin, the Australian concept of 'mediation' is understood to be a process of alternative dispute resolution in which an independent and impartial person assists two or more people who are in dispute to reach a voluntary, negotiated settlement of their dispute. The statement, 'The role of the mediator is wholly inappropriate for a court officer. Private discussion by each party with the mediator lies at the heart of the mediation process. It is a welcome development that courts are encouraging mediation but, if courts provide mediators from their own personnel, they place at risk public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judicial system' is discussed in The Honourable Sir Laurence Street's article 'Mediation and the Judicial Institution' and is a topic that can be explored in great depth. This essay will be deconstructing the issues related to this statement by firstly discussing how the integrity, impartiality and public confidence of the community can be hindered as a result of judicial mediation, and will further be discussing how limited court resources currently are and how the use of Judicial mediation can lead to the abuse of these resources. This will  then be contrasted with looking at points to support Judicial mediation and how it's implementation can practice the 'just, quick and cheap' ideology discussed in the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Finally, we will be discussing the constitutional validity of implementing judicial mediation and whether it can actually be practiced in NSW.




The role of a mediator is to act as an impartial third party that facilitates and steers discussion towards mutually beneficial solutions. It must be noted that judicial mediation refers to judge-conducted pre-settlement forums where they are assigned the task of mediating as opposed to adjudicating cases before the court . The scope of judicial mediation does not encompass services by retired judges in their personal capacity .
This essay  will challenge Sir Laurence Street's view that it is inappropriate for court officers to mediate. It will be established that judicial mediation falls under the scope of ChIII powers –resulting in legal recognition as a quasi-judicial power. Sir Street's  concerns about the potential decline in public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the courts will also be addressed by proving that the rule of law is preserved in judicial mediation. Furthermore, simple methods to combat the fear of prejudice and bias, in the trial of parties that initially partook in mediation, will be discussed. It will become clear that legal thinking has changed to recognise that public confidence is derived from an efficient judiciary that cannot function resourcefully without the assistance of professionals that conduct mediations.




As the legal industry develops contemporaneously with significant technological advancements the industry will constantly need a self re-assessment and restructuring. Whether this comes on a major or minor scale is dependent on the individual matter, nonetheless change is core to the ability of the judicial system to continuously move forward. This  approach is reflected in Honorary Justice Patrick Keane's (Keane) article The Early identification of issues with particular respect to the judicial process of' discovery.' Keane outlines the historical issues, problems and solutionsassociated with discovery and how these problems have unfortunately become compounded by technology when it was expected technology would simplify them. Keane indicates that there are some aspects of discovery that are opposed to the fundamentals of civil procedure. Specifically the words 'just, quick and cheap' as laid out in statute. Consequently this highlights the essential need for repair.
Keane draws on a workshop conducted by the Federal Court of Australia and the Law Council of Australia as an underlying authority for how he has exposed relevant issues surrounding discovery in the contemporary context, and how they might be solved. This is because the workshop utilizes the knowledge and experience of senior legal practitioners. Keane ultimately suggests that the use and collaboration of such knowledge is at the core benefit of the workshop. As it not only addresses the issues at hand but also endeavors to overcome them. Subsequently Keane identifies that the most ideal way to overcome the problems associated with discovery is to start from the top with these individuals and implement a proactive identification of issues early in the judicial process. Thus eliminating the maximum amount of potential difficulties associated with discovery.
This essay will  identify the problems Keane has outlined with particular interest in technological advancements. Further outlining how these issues are echoed throughout case law as well as other academics. Thus establishing a common recognition of the prevalent problematic nature of discovery. Finally demonstrating various solutions and the pragmatic failure or success of these with close regard to case law as well as the notions expressed by Keane in particular a shift of current ideology surrounding discovery.



Proportionality has been used as a way to inform and assist the requirement of 'just, quick and cheap resolution[s]' in civil litigation. It is a concept that attempts to balance two aims of court litigation- justice and efficiency in proceedings. Farrow contends that proportionality distracts those involved in the litigation process from the ultimate aim of the court- justice. In exploring this, the essay will make particular reference to Farrow's 'Proportionality: A cultural revolution,' Yara Australia Pty Ltd & Ors v Oswal [2013] VSCA 337 and Bellingen Shire Council v Colavon Pty Ltd [2012] NSWCA 34. Theessay will conclude that proportionality is a useful tool that must be used with caution.
