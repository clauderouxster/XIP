A few corpus- or application- specific class methods are called 
at several points (beginning of a document, of a sentence, end of 
parsing, ...), and it is possible to add more.

By default, the application is 
documentAnalysis.common.applications.Application and the corpus 
is documentAnalysis.common.corpora.Corpus. Default content of 
all methods is no content at all.

For a specific corpus or application, it is possible to create
a class extending Application or Corpus and overloading some
methods. 

A new application NewApplication.java extending Application
must be in package common.applications.newApplication (specific 
package).

A new corpus NewCorpus.java extending Corpus must be in package
common.application.corpora (same package as Corpus).

In order to make the system use these specific methods, you must
specify the corpus and/or the application in the runtime by
arguments or property files:
 - argument -app NewApplication and -corpus NewCorpus
 - properties APPLICATION = NewApplication and CORPUS = NewCorpus
 - This is case-insensitive.

Corpus- or application- specific runtime arguments can also be
set. All you have to do is to call these arguments APPLICATION_XXX
or CORPUS_XXX. The argument will then be directed to the 
appropriate Corpus or Application object (see main).
