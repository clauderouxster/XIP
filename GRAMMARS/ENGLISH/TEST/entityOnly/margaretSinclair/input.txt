  Margaret Sinclair Trudeau



Margaret Sinclair Trudeau, born September 10 ,
1948  in Vancouver, British Columbia
, Canada , was the
wife of the late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
.


The daughter of James Sinclair, a former Liberal
 member of the Parliament of Canada
 and fisheries minister, she attended Simon
Fraser University  where she obtained a
degree in English literature. As an 18-year-old on vacation in Tahiti
 she met Pierre Trudeau, the then Minister of Justice. Ms.
Sinclair did not recognize him and she in fact thought little of their
encounter but Trudeau was captivated by the carefree "flower-child" and
would begin to pursue her.

Pierre Trudeau (1919-2000) was still a bachelor when elected Prime
Minister of Canada  in 1968
. After keeping their dating from the press, to the shock of
the nation, the Prime Minister married the 22-year-old Sinclair on March
4 , 1971  in a private ceremony. This raised
some eyebrows among conservative Canadians because of their thirty year
age difference, but it was considered typical behavior for a prime
minister who prided himself on his "progressive" views and youthful
vigor. When asked about her role in a marriage to the most famous man in
the country, Margaret Trudeau said, "I want to be more than a rose in my
husband's lapel."

In December of 1971, the Trudeaus had their first child, Justin. In 1973
they had a second son, Alexandre (Sacha), and in 1975, Michel. Both
Justin and Sacha were born on Christmas  day.

Though the Canadian first couple initially appeared to have a very close
and loving relationship, the marriage began to fall apart. Margaret
resented Trudeau's constant work-related absences, and was forced to
raise the three young children largely by herself. Beyond the normal
extensive publicity that her high-profile position brought, on a few
instances she made her own headlines. On one occasion she was criticized
for not wearing a floor-length dress to an official White House
 dinner, and on another occasion the First Lady of
Canada acted as Cuban president Fidel Castro 's
photographer-for-a-day. It has been reported that she once launched into
an impromptu poetry recital during a state dinner with the President of
Venezuela . Over time, the marriage
disintegrated to the point that, as recounted in her book, Margaret had
an affair with a U.S. Senator, believed by many to be Ted Kennedy
 who had visited the Trudeaus in Ottawa.

Suffering from bouts of depression and under severe emotional stress,
she separated from her husband in 1977 and a single Margaret Trudeau
became a much talked about jet-setter. She gave many "tell-all"
interviews to Canadian and American magazines and appeared in two motion
pictures. On the eve of the 1980  election, in which Trudeau
was voted out of office, Margaret was dancing at Studio 54
 nightclub in New York City
. A photo of this was featured on many front pages
across the country. She was also associated with Rolling Stone
 Mick Jagger . A lover of the
poetry of William Blake , she used her public
prominence to author two books.

The Trudeaus officially divorced in 1984, and a short time later
Margaret married Ottawa  real-estate developer Fried
Kemper with whom she had two children. After her second marriage,
Margaret virtually disappeared from the public eye.

Despite their divorce, and even frequent bickering that got into the
press, Margaret and Pierre Trudeau made the children their priority.
Tragically, in November of 1998, their youngest son Michel, an avid
outdoorsman, was killed after an avalanche swept him to the bottom of
British Columbia's Kokanee Lake
. The lost of her son was
devastating for the vulnerable mother and Margaret suffered another
mental breakdown that led to her second divorce.

Despite everything, Pierre Trudeau was the love of her life and when he
passed away in 2000, Margaret was at his bedside. Today, she is the
Honorary President of WaterCan
, an Ottawa-based organization
dedicated to helping the poorest communities in developing countries
build sustainable water supply and sanitation services.

Once vital, yet always vulnerable, on the whole, Canadians feel
protective of Margaret Trudeau.
