  Joe Strummer

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

*John Graham Mellor* (August 24 , 1952  -
December 22 , 2002 ), better known as
*Joe Strummer*, was the co-founder and lead singer of punk rock
 band The Clash .

Before the Clash, he played in the Vultures and The 101ers
. The Clash were the most
musically diverse and overtly political of the original English punk
bands. Strummer was a controversial figure who became involved with the
left-wing  Anti-Nazi League 
and Rock Against Racism
 campaigns. He
later also gave his support to the /Rock Against the Rich/ series of
concerts organised by anarchist  organisation Class War
. The Clash's /London Calling /
album was voted best album of the 1980s  by Rolling Stone
magazine .

After the disbanding of the Clash, he acted in a few movies, recorded
movie soundtracks (notably "Love Kills" for the film /Sid and Nancy
/) and experimented with different backing bands
with limited success. Finally, in the mid- to late-1990s, Strummer
gathered top-flight musicians into a backing band he called The
Mescaleros . Strummer
signed with the Californian  punk label Hellcat
Records , and issued a
stunning album co-written with Anthony Genn, called /Rock Art and the
X-Ray Style/. A tour of England and North America soon followed; sets
included several Clash-fan favourites.

Following the release of /Global A Go-Go/, Joe Strummer and the
Mescaleros mounted a 21-date tour of North America, Britain, and
Ireland. Once again, these concerts featured Clash material ("London
Calling", "Rudie Can't Fail"), as well as classic covers of reggae
 hits ("The Harder They Come", "A Message To You, Rudie")
and regularly closed the show with a nod to the late Joey Ramone
 by playing The Ramones '
"Blitzkrieg Bop".

They also toured Australia in 2000  with the Big Day Out
 concert series, to a very warm reception.

Shortly before his death Joe Strummer co-wrote a song, "48864", for
Nelson Mandela  as part of a campaign against AIDS
 in Africa, and had been scheduled to play at Mandela's SOS
fundraising concert in February 2003  on Robben
Island .

Strummer died on December 22 , 2002 in his home in
Somerset, England , the victim of a heart
attack . His untimely death at the age of 50 shocked
and saddened a generation of Britons and other fans to whom he had been
an inspirational figure.

After the death of Joe Strummer in 2002. A tribute peformance was
performed at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards  by
Elvis Costello ,Bruce Springsteen
,Steven Van Zandt
,Dave Grohl
 and Tony Kanal
.
