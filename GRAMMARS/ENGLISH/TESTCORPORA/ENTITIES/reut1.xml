  <LOCORG>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands</LOCORG> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - The
  <ORGANISATION> World Court</ORGANISATION> said Friday it would rule on the legality of
  <LOCATION> Israel's West Bank</LOCATION> barrier next month in a case underlining a stalemate in peace efforts after more than three years of violence.

The
  <ORGANISATION> International Court of Justice</ORGANISATION>, also known as the
  <ORGANISATION> World Court</ORGANISATION>, will render its judgment on the legality of the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> network of fences and walls in a public hearing on
  <DATE> July 9</DATE>, one of the most high-profile rulings in its 58-year-history.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY> says the barrier has been built to keep Palestinian suicide bombers out of its cities. Palestinians call the structure -- which cuts deep into the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> in places -- a land grab that would thwart their dream of a viable state. The court held hearings on its legality in February.

The network snakes into the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> in some sections and in others runs close to the "Green Line" boundary between
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> before the
  <DATE> 1967</DATE>
  <LOCORG> Middle East</LOCORG> war. Plans call for the barrier to stretch about 420 miles, with 115 miles built so far.

The
  <ORGANISATION> United Nations</ORGANISATION> ' top court said it would hand down an "advisory opinion." Such a ruling is nonbinding, but
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY> fears the
  <EVENT> General Assembly</EVENT>, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is strong, could use it to lobby for sanctions against the Jewish state.

"After all the legal affidavits that have been presented to the international court, and since the wall is being built on occupied land, we expect that the court will condemn it," Palestinian Communications and
  <PERSON> Information Minister Azzam al-Ahmed</PERSON> told
  <ORGANISATION> Reuters</ORGANISATION>.

"We also expect that the court will demand that
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY> demolish what has been built," he said.

A dozen countries including
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Jordan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Cuba</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> South Africa</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Saudi Arabia</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, gave oral testimony on behalf of Palestinians in February. The
  <ORGANISATION> Israeli government</ORGANISATION> boycotted the hearings, saying the case was political and beyond the court's jurisdiction.

"The reason why
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY> built the fence -- the suicide bombers -- unfortunately ... still exists,"
  <PERSON> Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman David Saranga</PERSON> said.

"The fact that it took the court so long to decide, shows that as opposed to what the Palestinians and other countries said, that (the issue) is so urgent, the court apparently doesn't think it is so urgent," he said.

Although they have criticized the barrier's route, the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <ORGANISATION> European Union</ORGANISATION> declined to appear at the hearings in February, saying they fear a court ruling could complicate peace efforts.

The case stems from a Palestinian request -- backed by the
  <EVENT> United Nations General Assembly</EVENT> -- to decide whether
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY> is legally obliged to tear down its barrier. (Additional reporting by

  <LOCORG>ENNIS, Ireland</LOCORG> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - Thousands of troops, police and protesters took up positions across a swathe of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>western Ireland</LOCORG_COUNTRY> on Friday ahead of the arrival of
  <PERSON> President Bush</PERSON> for a summit with the
  <ORGANISATION> European Union </ORGANISATION>.

  <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> was due to arrive at
  <LOCORG> Shannon airport</LOCORG> at around 1500 EDT, amid local outrage at the measures taken to secure his safety, while much of the population is deeply unhappy over hosting him while
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> troops are occupying
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

"Fury and fear as town is turned into a fortress," read the headline in the Irish Examiner, quoting the mayor of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Shannon</LOCORG_CITY> as saying the town's residents were being made into a potential target for a terrorist attack.

"
  <PERSON>President Bush</PERSON> is coming...at the price of our civil liberties and free movement of people in their own place," complained local newspaper
  <ORGANISATION> The Clare Champion</ORGANISATION>.

But an Irish police spokeswoman said that by early afternoon on Friday there were no problems with traffic or protesters, as over 4,000 police and 2,000 troops patrolled with armored vehicles, water cannon and helicopters in brilliant sunshine.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Ireland</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, which holds the rotating presidency of the
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION> until the end of the month, is hosting the summit at the
  <DATE> 16th century</DATE> <LOCATION>Dromoland Castle</LOCATION>, which has been completely sealed off by the unprecedented security operation.

  <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> will be accompanied by
  <PERSON> Secretary of State Colin Powell</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Commerce Secretary Don Evans</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice</PERSON>, and possibly
  <PERSON> U.S. Trade Representative Bob Zoellick</PERSON>.

The
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION> side will be headed by
  <PERSON> Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> European Commission President Romano Prodi</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy</PERSON>, and
  <PERSON> Transport and Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio</PERSON>.

TIGHT SECURITY IN
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> TURKEY</LOCORG_COUNTRY>

The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S. </LOCORG_COUNTRY>team is due in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Ireland</LOCORG_COUNTRY> only for around 18 hours before heading on to
  <LOCORG_CITY> Istanbul, Turkey</LOCORG_CITY>, for a
  <ORGANISATION> NATO</ORGANISATION> summit. Security was also tight there after bombs in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Istanbul</LOCORG_CITY> and the capital,
  <LOCORG_CITY> Ankara</LOCORG_CITY>, killed four people on Thursday.

The
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION>-
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> summit, which formally starts at 11.00 a.m (1000 GMT) on Saturday, is set to focus on political links between the two sides, rather than the economic links which form the mainstay of relations between the two huge trade partners.   

It is the first such summit since the
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION> expanded last month to take in 10 new countries, raising its population to 450 million, and the first since
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION> leaders agreed to adopt a constitutional treaty for the bloc a week ago.

  <ORGANISATION>EU</ORGANISATION> diplomats say the bloc wants to use this new-found unity, in sharp contrast to the divisions which split its members in the run-up to last year's
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> war, to show the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> side that it is a major political actor and not just a trade bloc.

To back this up, the two sides will agree joint statements on a range of primarily political issues, such as
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, the
  <LOCORG> Middle East</LOCORG>, counter-terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, as well as on economic questions.

But there will also be a meeting of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, bringing together chief executives of some of the largest companies from both sides of the
  <LOCATION> Atlantic</LOCATION>, and the two sides will sign a cooperation agreement between the European Galileo and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> GPS satellite navigation systems.

In
  <DATE> 2003</DATE>, the
  <ORGANISATION> EU </ORGANISATION>exported goods worth 220 billion euros ($267 billion) to the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, importing 151 billion euros' ($183 billion) worth. Two-way foreign direct investment between the partners was worth over 1.5 trillion euros in <DATE>2002</DATE>. ($1=.8245 Euro)

  <LOCORG_CITY>HAVANA</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - An independent Cuban journalist walked out of prison to become the sixth ailing government opponent freed after a crackdown on dissent last year, opposition sources said on Thursday.

  <PERSON>Manuel Vazquez Portal</PERSON>, 52, who suffers from respiratory problems, was one of 75 dissidents sentenced to an average of 19 years in prison after daylong trials in
  <DATE> April 2003</DATE>.

"He arrived home around midnight and looked well," said
  <PERSON> Laura Pollan</PERSON>, wife of still-imprisoned
  <PERSON> Hector Maseda</PERSON>.

  <PERSON>Academic Roberto de Miranda</PERSON>, 62, who had been sentenced to 20 years behind bars, was also released on Wednesday. He suffers from a heart condition.

The first of the six was released in April and all were conditionally freed for health reasons.

Last year's crackdown, considered the harshest in decades, provoked an outcry from numerous governments,
  <PERSON> Pope John Paul</PERSON>, and other prominent people.

Communist authorities accused the 75 opponents of working with the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to overthrow
  <ORGANISATION> President Fidel Castro's government</ORGANISATION>, a charge they denied.

The repression led to a dramatic deterioration of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cuba</LOCORG_CITY>'s relations with the
  <ORGANISATION> European Union </ORGANISATION>, which continues to demand all 75 prisoners be freed.

In a separate case, four other dissidents were unexpectedly released this month after being held for more than two years without trial.

But another 16 government opponents have been jailed since April, according to veteran human rights activist
  <PERSON> Elizardo Sanchez</PERSON>.

  <ORGANISATION>Amnesty International</ORGANISATION> reported this year that there were 88 prisoners of conscience in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cuba</LOCORG_CITY>.

  <LOCORG_CITY>BEIJING</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - A North Korean warning that some of its leaders wanted to test a nuclear device overshadowed six-way talks Friday aimed at resolving the North's nuclear crisis, with a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> official saying there had been no breakthrough.

"We are far from agreement," the official in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Beijing </LOCORG_CITY>said.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> officials said the comment about a nuclear test, made in a two-hour meeting between Assistant 
  <PERSON>Secretary of State James Kelly </PERSON>and North Korean negotiators in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Beijing</LOCORG_CITY> Thursday, resembled those from
  <LOCORG_CITY> Pyongyang</LOCORG_CITY> in the past.

It raised doubts even faint progress could be achieved as the third round of talks among
   North and <LOCORG_COUNTRY>South Korea</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Russia</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> China</LOCORG_COUNTRY> ended their third day. The previous rounds ended with agreement only to meet again.

The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> official, speaking to reporters in the Chinese capital, confirmed the North Korean delegation raised the issue of a nuclear test, but not as a threat.

"They did say something to the effect that there were some persons not identified in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> DPRK</LOCORG_COUNTRY> (
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>North Korea</LOCORG_COUNTRY>) that want to test a nuclear weapon and presumably might do so," the official told reporters.

"It was put as a sort of statement intended, I guess, to interest us. It was not phrased as a threat. But we made clear that we would certainly not welcome any such thing and we believe that any such thing would be a very unwise choice."

The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> official stressed there had been no breakthroughs.

"Looking at the last two days, I would say there's some good, some bad, some a little ugly but not as much as been the case in the past. The results would have to be described as mixed so far. There are no breakthroughs."

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>China</LOCORG_COUNTRY> said a consensus had been reached a freeze would be the first step to the denuclearization of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> North Korea</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

"This round of talks already has reached some results -- a fundamental political consensus exists that a nuclear freeze is the first step toward denuclearization and corresponding measures should be adopted,"
  <PERSON> Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue</PERSON> told a news conference.    Continued ...

  <LOCORG_CITY>ASADABAD</LOCORG_CITY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Afghanistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - Two
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> Marines were killed and one wounded when their patrol was ambushed during an operation against Islamic militants in eastern
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Afghanistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, military officials said on Friday.

The Marines were killed in
  <LOCATION> Kunar province</LOCATION>, which borders
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Pakistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, on Thursday evening, said
  <PERSON> military spokeswoman Master Sergeant Cindy Beam</PERSON>.

She said the wounded Marine was hurt by gunfire, but she said she did not know how the two were killed.

The attack happened in a mountainous district called
  <LOCATION> Naray</LOCATION> close to the border with
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Pakistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, residents there said. They said they saw the bodies of the two Marines and they appeared to have been shot with AK-47 assault rifles.

  <PERSON>Mohammad Zaman Malang</PERSON>, a top military commander in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Kunar's capital Asadabad</LOCORG_CITY>, said the Marines came under fire as they were moving through a valley.

"They were going up on foot and were fired on with heavy and light machineguns," he said.

  <PERSON>Malang</PERSON> said the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> patrol called in air support and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> aircraft dropped bombs, but it was not clear if any attackers were hit. He said the planes were again circling on Friday.

He said the ambush could have been the work of militants loyal to a fundamentalist warlord,
  <PERSON> Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</PERSON>, the Taliban or
  <ORGANISATION> al Qaeda</ORGANISATION>, all of whom are active in the area.

The deaths took to 59 the number of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> personnel killed in combat in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Afghanistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> since
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led forces overthrew the Taliban for sheltering
  <ORGANISATION> Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda</ORGANISATION> after the
  <DATE> September 11</DATE> attacks in
  <DATE> 2001</DATE>.

The Taliban and their allies have declared a holy war against
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led forces and clashes have mounted as September elections, which the militants have vowed to disrupt, approach.

This month, a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> soldier was killed and two were wounded when their vehicle was hit by an explosion in the central <LOCATION>province of Uruzgan</LOCATION>.

Four
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> special forces soldiers were killed in action in the southern <LOCATION>province of Zabul</LOCATION> in late May, in one of the worst losses for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> forces since the overthrow of the Taliban late in
  <DATE> 2001</DATE>.    Continued ...

  <LOCORG_CITY>WASHINGTON</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - For the first time since the start of the war in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, a majority of Americans now say the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led invasion was a mistake, according to a
  <ORGANISATION>   USA Today</ORGANISATION>/
  <ORGANISATION>CNN</ORGANISATION>/
  <ORGANISATION>Gallup</ORGANISATION> Poll released on Thursday.

Amid continuing violence in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and questions about the justification for the war, 54 percent of the 1,005 Americans polled said it was a mistake to send
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> troops into
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, compared with 41 percent who held that view three weeks ago.

The findings mark the first time since
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Vietnam</LOCORG_COUNTRY> that a majority of Americans has called a major deployment of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> forces a mistake,
  <ORGANISATION>   USA Today</ORGANISATION> reported on its Web site.

In addition, the poll found that for the first time a majority also said the war in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has made the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> less safe from terrorism.

Fifty-five percent said the war has increased
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> vulnerability, compared to a December poll in which 56 percent said the war made the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> safer.

The war's original justification was to stop
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> deploying weapons of mass destruction. None have been found.

  <PERSON>President Bush</PERSON> has also said the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> mission would make
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN> safer by bringing democracy to a key country in the
  <LOCORG> Middle East</LOCORG>.

In
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> on Thursday, insurgents killed about 100 people in a wave of attacks across the country aimed at sabotaging next week's transfer of power to an
  <ORGANISATION> interim Iraqi government</ORGANISATION>.

Despite Americans' changing attitudes toward the war, the poll found
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> in a statistical dead heat with 
  <PERSON> presumptive Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry</PERSON>. Among likely voters,
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> edged out
  <PERSON> Kerry</PERSON> 48 percent to 47 percent. Three weeks ago,
  <PERSON> Kerry</PERSON> led 49 percent to 43 percent.

In the new poll, 60 percent of respondents said they believe the
  <LOCORG> Massachusetts</LOCORG> Democrat could handle the job of commander-in-chief, but most Americans indicated they trust
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> more in that role, 51 percent to 43 percent.

The survey, conducted Monday through Wednesday, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

  <LOCORG_CITY>WASHINGTON</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) -
  <PERSON> Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore</PERSON> on Thursday accused
  <PERSON> President Bush</PERSON> of telling "an artful and important lie" soon after the
  <DATE> Sept. 11</DATE> attacks to set the stage for war on
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

"Beginning very soon after the attacks of
  <DATE> 9/11</DATE>,
  <PERSON> President Bush</PERSON> made a decision to start mentioning
  <PERSON> Osama bin Laden</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Saddam Hussein</PERSON> in the same breath in a cynical mantra designed to fuse them together as one in the public's mind,"
  <PERSON> Gore</PERSON> said in a speech at
  <LOCORG> Georgetown University Law Center</LOCORG>.

  <PERSON>Gore</PERSON>, a Democrat who lost to
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> in a
  <LOCORG> White House</LOCORG> race ultimately decided by the
  <ORGANISATION> Supreme Court</ORGANISATION> despite winning the popular vote in
  <DATE> 2000</DATE>, cited the recent report by the
  <DATE> Sept. 11</DATE> commission saying no credible evidence existed of a link between the Iraqi leader and
  <PERSON> bin Laden</PERSON>.

He said
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Vice President Dick Cheney</PERSON> continue to argue for a connection between
  <ORGANISATION>   bin Laden's al Qaeda</ORGANISATION> network and the deposed Iraqi regime because it supports their push for war in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and justifies "some of the new power they've picked up from the
  <ORGANISATION> Congress</ORGANISATION> and the courts" since the
  <DATE> 2001</DATE> hijack attacks in
  <LOCORG> New York</LOCORG>,
  <LOCORG> Washington</LOCORG> and
  <LOCORG> Pennsylvania</LOCORG>.

"As a result,
  <PERSON> President Bush</PERSON> is now intentionally misleading the American people,"
  <PERSON> Gore</PERSON> said. "Indeed,
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>'s consistent and careful artifice is itself evidence that he knew full well that he was telling an artful and important lie -- visibly circumnavigating the truth over and over again as if he had practiced how to avoid encountering the truth."

In an hour-long address punctuated by polite laughter and applause,
  <PERSON> Gore</PERSON> also accused the
  <ORGANISATION> Bush administration</ORGANISATION> of working closely "with a network of 'rapid response' digital Brown Shirts who work to pressure reporters and their editors for 'undermining support for our troops."'

  <LOCORG_CITY>TOKYO</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) -
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> will consider using unique biological data about individuals such as fingerprints and facial features to tighten immigration controls as part of its counter-terrorism policy, government officials said Wednesday.

The move would be in line with measures in many other countries, including the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, which has begun fingerprinting and photographing most visitors from abroad in the wake of the
  <DATE> September 11, 2001</DATE> attacks.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has decided to introduce passports with chips containing so-called biometrics information next year, and would look into whether to make use of such data in screening foreign visitors, the officials said.

Calls for tighter immigration controls have gained momentum since revelations last month that
  <ORGANISATION> al Qaeda</ORGANISATION> might have attempted to build a network in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

Japanese police arrested several foreigners in May in an investigation into the activities of a French national with links to
  <ORGANISATION> al Qaeda</ORGANISATION> who entered
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> on a false passport in
  <DATE> 2002</DATE> and stayed for over a year.

But
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tokyo</LOCORG_CITY> has not made any decisions yet, given concerns that stricter immigration controls might turn off tourists thinking about visiting
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and due to criticism by some human rights groups that the use of biometrics was a violation of individual rights.

"Biometrics may lead to a strengthening of surveillance of society," said
  <PERSON> Makoto Teranaka</PERSON>, secretary-general of
  <ORGANISATION> Amnesty International</ORGANISATION>'s
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan </LOCORG_COUNTRY>branch.

"There must be utmost caution in how such information is gathered and how it is used," he said.

A working team of officials, including those from foreign and justice ministries, plan to start discussions on the issue later this month, officials said.

"We are aware of the debate over private information and the potential impact on our tourism policy," said an official at the
  <ORGANISATION> Cabinet Office</ORGANISATION>.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has set up a goal to double the number of tourists to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> by
  <DATE> 2010</DATE> -- about 5.73 million foreigners entered
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> in
  <DATE> 2003</DATE> -- to turn around its huge deficit in tourism.

In
  <DATE> 2001</DATE>, the latest year for which official figures are available,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> had a $23 billion deficit on tourism, with Japanese travelers spending $26 billion abroad, while visitors to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> spent $3 billion.

  <LOCORG_CITY>ROME</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) -
  <PERSON> Mariolina Moioli</PERSON> dreams of bringing civilization to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Italy</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s chaotic streets.

That means the end of an era for carefree 14-year-olds who for generations have been allowed to drive scooters without so much as a permit or a driving lesson.

The sight of adolescents buzzing around on their scooters is as quintessentially Italian as pizza and pasta -- as are the daily reports of teen-agers killed after speeding along the
  <LOCATION> Tiber</LOCATION> or running a red light in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Rome</LOCORG_CITY>'s hectic traffic.

"We're not going to save the world, but it's something," said
  <PERSON> Moioli</PERSON>, explaining a plan to teach "good behavior" on the roads as part of the preparation for the introduction of a "mini-license" for under-18s wanting to drive scooters. Hundreds of thousands of teen-agers now face the prospect of having to park their beloved Vespas starting
  <DATE> July 1</DATE> or pay a fine of more than $600 if they are caught without the mini-license.

Currently anybody is allowed to drive a scooter with an engine of 50 cc from the age of 14 without a license.

"It's about behavior and values, about respect for life, how to behave with others, basically how to drive in a civilized way," said
  <PERSON> Moioli</PERSON>, director general of the
  <LOCORG>  Education Ministry</LOCORG>.

But 17-year-old
  <PERSON> Giovanni De Angelis</PERSON> and many fellow teen-agers are crying foul.

"It ridiculous. For more powerful motorbikes maybe it makes sense but not for the smaller ones. And maybe for 14-year-olds -- if they're so small they can't even reach the handle bars."

  <PERSON>De Angelis</PERSON> will not be taking the exam himself, he added with a shrug, because his scooter has been stolen.

"It's been chaos, at least they should give a bit more time," he said.

Motor organizations also complain that there has been insufficient time to complete the courses and the tests.    Continued ...

  <LOCORG_CITY>LOS ANGELES</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) -
  <ORGANISATION> Walt Disney Co.</ORGANISATION> plans to scale back spending on films, although it aims to remain a
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> staple,
  <PERSON> Chief Executive Michael Eisner</PERSON> and other executives said on Thursday.

"We are reducing our investment in our film businesses,"
  <PERSON> Eisner</PERSON> said in a small meeting with investors and a
  <LOCORG> Wall Street</LOCORG> analyst that the company
  <ORGANISATION> Webcast</ORGANISATION>.

  <PERSON>Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs </PERSON>told the investors that a slate of 13 to 16 films per year for the
  <ORGANISATION> Disney</ORGANISATION>,
  <ORGANISATION> Hollywood Pictures</ORGANISATION> and
  <ORGANISATION> Touchstone labels</ORGANISATION>, produced good results since executives were forced to be selective in the movies they make and market.

"We found there is no direct correlation between spending more and making more in terms of our returns,"
  <PERSON> Chief Operating Officer Bob Iger</PERSON> said.

"We would like to spend less, be more focused, spend more on
  <ORGANISATION> Disney</ORGANISATION>-branded properties and what I call franchise model pictures" like "Pirates of the Caribbean," he said.

"If we are going to invest in entertainment, I think there are better ways to spend our money than live-action (films), but we are going to continue to invest substantially in it," he said.

  <ORGANISATION>Disney's Miramax division </ORGANISATION>also produces films, and
  <PERSON> Iger</PERSON> said the focus on fewer live-action films could affect negotiations with division chiefs
  <PERSON> Bob</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Harvey Weinstein</PERSON>.
  <ORGANISATION> Disney</ORGANISATION> has the option to extend their current contract from <DATE>2005</DATE> to <DATE>2009</DATE>.

"The desire of the company long term is to invest less in live-action movies, and in order to do that, there's got to be some give here and there, and that is sort of where the rubber might meet the road in terms of any future relationship" with the
  <PERSON> Weinsteins</PERSON>, he said in the meeting with
  <PERSON> Deutsche Bank's Doug Mitchelson</PERSON> and investors, monitored via

  <ORGANISATION> Disney</ORGANISATION> did not see many more places to build major traditional theme parks around the world beside the one under construction in

  <LOCORG_CITY>LOS ANGELES</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <LOCORG>Hollywood</LOCORG> Reporter) - Just as his "Fahrenheit 9/11" opens nationwide, several filmmakers are readying documentaries aimed at debunking
  <PERSON> Michael Moore</PERSON>, and a new film festival is being planned that will feature such works as well as other documentaries well to the right of
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>'s films.

Scheduled
  <DATE> Sept. 9-11</DATE> in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Dallas</LOCORG_CITY>, the American Film Renaissance, as the festival will be known, has just been announced by co-founder
  <PERSON> Jim Hubbard</PERSON>, who said it is bankrolled primarily by some "big-time conservative donors."

  <PERSON>Hubbard</PERSON> currently is negotiating to show two films critical of
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>.

The first is "
  <PERSON>Michael Moore</PERSON> Hates
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>," made by newcomer
  <PERSON> Michael Wilson</PERSON> and funded partially by
  <PERSON> Brian Cartmell</PERSON>, who made a small fortune when he sold his Internet domain registration company,
  <ORGANISATION> eNic</ORGANISATION>, to
  <ORGANISATION> Verisign</ORGANISATION>. The feature film, made for $200,000 and featuring appearances from
  <PERSON> Penn Jillette</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> John Stossel</PERSON>, among others, is looking for a theatrical and DVD distribution deal.

The second is the bigger-budget effort "
  <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> & Me" that was made by talk-radio star and soon-to-be TV host
  <PERSON> Larry Elder</PERSON>. The 90-minute documentary takes on
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>'s
  <DATE> 2002</DATE> anti-gun documentary, "Bowling for Columbine,"
  <PERSON> Elder</PERSON> said.

"My film is a defense of those who own guns and of the Second Amendment," said
  <PERSON> Elder</PERSON>, whose "The
  <PERSON> Larry Elder</PERSON> Show" from
  <ORGANISATION> Warner Bros. Prods.</ORGANISATION> starts
  <DATE> Sept. 13</DATE> on
  <ORGANISATION> CBS </ORGANISATION>affiliates in most major markets.

  <PERSON>Elder</PERSON> said that he borrows liberally from
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>, including a "Bowling"-like animated segment that has
  <PERSON> Elder</PERSON> interviewing an obviously tense
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>. "He's sweating and sweating to the point he's reed thin, then he pulls out a gun and shoots me."

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> didn't agree to an interview for either
  <PERSON> Elder</PERSON>'s movie or
  <PERSON> Wilson</PERSON>'s. "I did ambush him at a book signing in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Santa Monica</LOCORG_CITY>, and that's in the film,"
  <PERSON> Elder</PERSON> said. "I asked him how many times Americans used guns for defensive purposes. He had nothing. No blooming clue."

For
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>'s part, he said he's familiar with the title "
  <PERSON>Michael Moore</PERSON> Hates
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>" but doubts the movie even exists, beyond the trailer that can be seen on the Internet.

"You're being duped by the kooky right," he said. "I've been waiting to see this movie. It sounds like great science fiction."

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> said he hadn't heard of
  <PERSON> Elder</PERSON>'s film "
  <PERSON>Michael</PERSON> & Me."   


As for the festival,
  <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>said that about 10 films are confirmed, and he'll cap it at about two dozen.
  <PERSON> Film reviewer Michael Medved</PERSON> is a confirmed guest as is
  <PERSON> Lionel Chetwynd</PERSON>, whose Showtime movie "DC 9/11," starring
  <PERSON> Timothy Bottoms</PERSON> as
  <PERSON> President Bush</PERSON>, will be shown.

"I'm itching to show that anywhere I can,"
  <PERSON> Chetwynd</PERSON> said. "Like with all cable films, you want to keep it out there as long as you can to get it in front of as wide an audience as possible."

  <PERSON>Hubbard</PERSON> and wife,
  <PERSON> Ellen</PERSON>, both attorneys, co-founded the festival in the spirit of competition. Boycott efforts, like the one from the group
  <ORGANISATION> MoveAmericaForward.org</ORGANISATION> that is asking exhibitors not to show
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>'s "Fahrenheit 9/11," "are for the weak,"
  <PERSON> Hubbard</PERSON> said.

"We want everyone to see
  <PERSON> Michael Moore</PERSON>'s film," he said. "We also want everyone to see '
  <PERSON>Michael Moore</PERSON> Hates
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>.' Conservatives complain about institutional bias in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Hollywood</LOCORG_CITY>. They need to stop whining and get out there and produce."

"Documentaries," added
  <PERSON> filmmaker Wilson</PERSON>, "are not 'Lions of the Serengeti' anymore. In this politically charged climate, they're skewed to an agenda, be it
  <PERSON> Michael Moore</PERSON>'s or mine."

Not all films screened at the American Film Renaissance will invoke
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>.
  <PERSON> Patrick Wright</PERSON>'s documentary, "Is It True What They Say About
  <PERSON> Ann</PERSON>?" focuses on
  <PERSON> Ann Coulter</PERSON>, the
  <ORGANISATION> Fox News</ORGANISATION> pundit.

And the war on terror also is expected to be a dominant theme at the American Film Renaissance.

"Liberal
  <LOCORG_CITY> Hollywood</LOCORG_CITY> has basically ignored the subject,"
  <PERSON> filmmaker Jason Apuzzo</PERSON> said. His entry to the festival is "Terminal Island" and stars his wife,
  <PERSON> Govindini Murty</PERSON>, with a cameo from
  <PERSON> Irvin Kershner</PERSON>, director of "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Never Say Never Again."
  <PERSON> Kershner</PERSON>, who
  <PERSON> Apuzzo</PERSON> noted does not share the same politics as
  <PERSON> Apuzzo</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Murty</PERSON>, nevertheless mentored the couple in the making of their film.

"Conservative messages don't have a chance in contemporary
  <LOCORG_CITY> Hollywood</LOCORG_CITY>,"
  <PERSON> Apuzzo</PERSON> said. "But there's another side in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Hollywood</LOCORG_CITY>. We are small in numbers but passionate."

"Terminal Island" is a black-and-white feature film about a woman being stalked by a Muslim terrorist who is himself being stalked by a bounty hunter.

"When you shop a script like this around," said
  <PERSON> Murty</PERSON>, "studio execs say, 'Is this about Muslim terrorists? We don't want to touch it."'

So why have a couple of lawyers from
  <LOCORG> Texas</LOCORG> created a film festival? "I've always been interested in the cultural and political messages in film,"
  <PERSON> Jim Hubbard</PERSON> said. "To be frank, whenever there is such a message, it's liberal. For 40 years the left has had a near monopoly, and we're going to counter that."

  <DATE> 1996-08-19</DATE>
 
 A "tired but apparently unharmed" Japanese electronics executive was freed by kidnappers on Monday after they received $2 million in unmarked $100 bills, government officials said. 
 After nine days in captivity,
  <PERSON> Mamoru Konno</PERSON>, president of a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> subsidiary of
  <ORGANISATION> Japan's Sanyo Electric Co.</ORGANISATION>, was found in the basement of an unoccupied building in this northern Mexican city just before 4 a.m. local time. 
  <PERSON> Jose Luis Anaya Bautista</PERSON>, State Attorney General of
  <LOCORG> Baja California</LOCORG>, told a news conference the end of the abduction was a two-day ordeal in which the ransom was handed over with no apparent guarantee
  <PERSON> Konno</PERSON> would be released. 
 He said on Saturday night an officer of
  <ORGANISATION>   Mexico's State Judicial Police</ORGANISATION> drove a
  <ORGANISATION> Sanyo</ORGANISATION> company vehicle to the
  <LOCORG> La Jolla</LOCORG> section of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tijuana</LOCORG_CITY> where he met two of the alleged kidnappers and handed over an envelope containing $2 million in unmarked $100 bills. 
 At 10 p.m. on Monday night authorities received a call from the kidnappers directing them to an area in the
  <LOCORG> La Mesa district</LOCORG> of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tijuana</LOCORG_CITY> where they found
  <PERSON> Konno</PERSON> "tired but apparently unharmed" in the basement of a disused building, he said. 
  <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>said police were looking for six suspects, all believed to be Mexican nationals. 
 "I was pleased to be able to talk to
  <PERSON> Mr. Konno</PERSON> and to tell him how happy we are to have him back with us safe and sound,"
  <PERSON> Anaya</PERSON> said. "He was very grateful to us for having helped him." 
  <PERSON> Konno </PERSON>was seized on
  <DATE> Aug. 10</DATE> as he was travelling home to
  <LOCORG_CITY> San Diego</LOCORG_CITY> from a company party and baseball game in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tijuana</LOCORG_CITY>. 
 He was the first high-ranking foreign executive kidnapped in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Mexico</LOCORG_COUNTRY> in recent years and his abduction fuelled fears that criminals may target some of the thousands of foreign executives who work in factories along the <LOCATION>Mexican-U.S. border</LOCATION>. 
  <PERSON> Sanyo North America President Moto Haru Iue</PERSON> said: "I express my sincere appreciation for all who helped bring about (
  <PERSON>Konno</PERSON>'s) safe return.
  <PERSON> Mr. Konno</PERSON> is in good health and relieved it's over." 
 But underscoring some of the doubts that have emerged since the kidnapping about the safety of working in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Mexico</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, he said he did not know if
  <PERSON> Konno</PERSON> would return to work at the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tijuana</LOCORG_CITY> plant. "We will have to consider security first," he said. 
 Kidnappings are on the rise in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Mexico</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, fuelled partly by the
  <DATE> December 1994</DATE> peso crisis and the subsequent deep recession, which threw more than a million people out of work. Experts say amateur and professional criminal gangs, former and current policemen and leftist rebels of the self-styled
  <ORGANISATION> Popular Revolutionary Army</ORGANISATION> are among the main suspects. 
  <PERSON> Konno</PERSON>'s release will remove a cloud over the visit to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Mexico</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, set to begin on Tuesday, by
  <PERSON> Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto</PERSON>.
  <PERSON> Hashimoto</PERSON> will visit three other countries during a 10-day tour of
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Latin America</LOCORG_CONTIN>. 
 During the ordeal, Mexican police in
  <LOCORG> Baja California</LOCORG> had said they were not involved in any efforts to free
  <PERSON> Konno</PERSON>, saying they had been officially notified by
  <ORGANISATION> Sanyo</ORGANISATION> of his abduction.

  <ORGANISATION> Leading European cartonboard manufacturer Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG</ORGANISATION> (
  <ORGANISATION>MMK</ORGANISATION>) said on Tuesday it was committed to paying out a dividend for
  <DATE> 1996</DATE> after scrapping its dividend last year. 
 "The dividend for
  <DATE> 1996</DATE> has already been secured through payments that have come into the parent company,"
  <PERSON> chief executive Michael Groeller</PERSON> told journalists after presenting the company's first-half earnings. 
  <PERSON> Groeller</PERSON> declined to say how big the dividend would be but said that "our shareholders will be satisfied." 
 Earlier this year investors were miffed when
  <ORGANISATION> MMK </ORGANISATION>reported an 18 percent jump in
  <DATE> 1995</DATE> group pre-tax profit to 430 million schillings but decided to scrap its dividend after paying out 14 schillings in
  <DATE> 1994</DATE>. 
  <ORGANISATION> MMK</ORGANISATION> decided to forego a
  <DATE> 1995</DATE> dividend after profits at the holding company were wiped out by a write-down in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, where its
  <ORGANISATION> FS Karton AG</ORGANISATION> unit suffered significant losses.

 Bonds were nudging higher but liquidity was very thin on a day when the Treasury rejected all bids at its five-year bond sale. 
 Traders said the market was going to remain on hold until after the
  <ORGANISATION> Federal Open Market Committee</ORGANISATION> (
  <ORGANISATION>FOMC</ORGANISATION>) meeting later on Tuesday. 
 "There is no desire to do anything in either futures or cash," said one trader. 
 Traders said that the Treasury decision was a clear sign that it was not prepared to accept any increase in yields.   
 Bidded yields had been expected to be higher than the previous sale on
  <DATE> July 25</DATE> because of uncertainty over the
  <ORGANISATION> FOMC</ORGANISATION> and the fact that end-users were out of the market. 
 They said demand at the auction only totalled 36 billion for the 20 billion escudos of paper on offer. 
 The escudo was also calm.

 State-controlled insurer
  <ORGANISATION> GAN</ORGANISATION> jumped up to 6.4 percent on the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Paris </LOCORG_CITY>bourse after a newspaper said savings bank group
  <ORGANISATION> Caisses d'Epargne</ORGANISATION> was preparing a firm bid for
  <ORGANISATION> GAN's CIC</ORGANISATION> banking subsidiary. 
 At 1112 GMT,
  <ORGANISATION> GAN</ORGANISATION> was up 6.7 francs or 5.33 percent at 132.4 francs per share after trading as high as 133.8 francs. 
 Volume however was a thin 7,007 shares. 
  <ORGANISATION> La Tribune Desfosses</ORGANISATION> reported on Tuesday that
  <ORGANISATION> Caisses d'Epargne</ORGANISATION>, which announced its interest in
  <ORGANISATION> CIC</ORGANISATION>'s upcoming privatisation on
  <DATE> August 1</DATE>, was ready to make a "firm offer" for the regional banking group, of which 67 percent is on sale.   
 Analysts noted
  <ORGANISATION> Caisses d'Epargne</ORGANISATION> had not publicly contested
  <ORGANISATION> GAN</ORGANISATION>'s book value for
  <ORGANISATION> CIC</ORGANISATION> of 14.1 billion francs for 100 percent. 
 That would avoid a book loss on the sale for
  <ORGANISATION> GAN</ORGANISATION> and would mean the state did not have to recapitalise
  <ORGANISATION> CIC</ORGANISATION>, they said. 
 Analysts said there was also market speculation that
  <ORGANISATION> Caisses d'Epargne</ORGANISATION> had been persuaded by the state to make an offer for 15,
  <ORGANISATION> CIC</ORGANISATION> to prevent it going to foreign buyers. 
 Such a move would also mean
  <ORGANISATION> Caisses d'Epargne</ORGANISATION> using its own funds, which would please commercial banks which want to see the savings bank weakened, they said.
  <ORGANISATION> Caisses d'Epargne</ORGANISATION> has a monopoly on the popular pass-book Livret A savings account.

 The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> reacted angrily on Tuesday to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s formal veto of a nuclear test ban treaty and said it would work to bypass
  <LOCORG_CITY> New Delhi</LOCORG_CITY>'s opposition and have the treaty adopted and signed anyway. 
 After a meeting at which
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India </LOCORG_COUNTRY>confirmed its veto,
  <PERSON> U.S. disarmament ambassador Stephen Ledogar</PERSON> accused it of being "insincere" in its arguments against the test ban, telling reporters: "The real reason is that the current government in
  <LOCORG_CITY> New Delhi</LOCORG_CITY> wants to maintain the nuclear weapon option."   
 Earlier,
  <PERSON> India's Arundhati Ghose</PERSON> told the international Conference on Disarmament that her country could still not accept the treaty text, which it first vetoed in a negotiating committee last week. 
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, one of three nuclear "threshold states", says that the treaty should include a time-bound commitment by the five declared nuclear powers for total nuclear disarmament. 
  <PERSON> Ledogar</PERSON> said the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was never meant to be a nuclear disarmament pact until
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY> decided last year that it should be so. 
 He said the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and other supporters of the treaty would act "in the next few days" to either have the draft treaty introduced to the
  <EVENT> U.N. General Assembly</EVENT> for signature late next month or would convene an international signature conference outside
  <ORGANISATION> U.N.</ORGANISATION> auspices.

 Dutch tank storage and shipping group
  <ORGANISATION> Pakhoed</ORGANISATION> NV said on Tuesday it expected net profit from ordinary operations in the second half of
  <DATE> 1996</DATE> to be "clearly higher" than in the same period of
  <DATE> 1995</DATE>.   
  <ORGANISATION> Pakhoed</ORGANISATION> posted a first-half net profit of 4.6 million guilders, down from 61.4 million in the year-ago period. 
 This year's figure included a 54.3 million guilder extraordinary charge because of the sale of the <ORGANISATION>Furness</ORGANISATION> subsidiary and a restructuring of
  <ORGANISATION> Pakhoed</ORGANISATION>'s
  <LOCORG_CITY> Rotterdam</LOCORG_CITY> tank storage operations. 
 "Apart from the costs in relation to the final transfer of
  <ORGANISATION> Furness</ORGANISATION> we don't expect further extraordinary charges in the second half-year of
  <DATE> 1996</DATE>," the firm said in a statement. 
 It added its leading positions in logistics and distribution would be a strong basis for further earnings development.   
  <ORGANISATION> Pakhoed</ORGANISATION> said the reorganisation would cause substantial cost reductions at the units concerned. In addition, the sale of
  <ORGANISATION> Furness</ORGANISATION> and the previously announced takeover of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> chemicals distributor
  <ORGANISATION> Univar Corp</ORGANISATION> would have an important effect. 
 "
  <ORGANISATION>Royal Pakhoed</ORGANISATION> has taken several important measures aimed at implementing the strategic objectives and which will have a substantial effect on
  <ORGANISATION> Pakhoed</ORGANISATION>'s results for
  <DATE> 1996</DATE> and will put
  <ORGANISATION> Pakhoed</ORGANISATION> in a much better position for the future," it said. 
  <ORGANISATION> Pakhoed</ORGANISATION> offered $19.45 per
  <ORGANISATION> Univar</ORGANISATION> share in June. It said it now owned 97 percent of all
  <ORGANISATION> Univar</ORGANISATION> shares and said the deal had a total value of 521 million guilders.   
 The company used standby facilities to pay for the
  <ORGANISATION> Univar</ORGANISATION> takeover but said it intends to carry out a refinancing operation in the autumn of this year. 
 "A study is currently under way to determine the extent and conditions of the refinancing, also depending on the financial divesture of
  <ORGANISATION> Furness</ORGANISATION> and the determination of the goodwill involved in the acquisition of
  <ORGANISATION> Univar</ORGANISATION>,"
  <ORGANISATION> Pakhoed</ORGANISATION> said. 
 Earlier this month, it said it had reached a tentative agreement on selling
  <ORGANISATION> Furness</ORGANISATION> to industrial investment firm
  <ORGANISATION> Hollandia Industriele Maatschappij NV</ORGANISATION>.

  <LOCORG> PERTH, Australia</LOCORG> <DATE>1996-08-20</DATE> 
 
  <PERSON> Failed Australian businessman Alan Bond</PERSON> was sentenced to three years in jail on Tuesday for fraud involving the French impressionist painting, La Promenade. 
 The
  <ORGANISATION> Western Australia District Court</ORGANISATION> sentenced
  <PERSON> Bond</PERSON> after a jury last Friday found him guilty of four fraud charges, brought by the corporate watchdog the <ORGANISATION>Australian Securities Commission</ORGANISATION>, which carried a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail.   
  <PERSON> Bond</PERSON>, who became a national hero in
  <DATE> 1983</DATE> for winning the
   <EVENT>America's Cup</EVENT> yachting trophy, had appealed for a non-custodial sentence. His lawyer argued that a jail term could kill him. 
 But
  <PERSON> Judge Antoinette Kennedy</PERSON> said she was satisfied
  <PERSON> Bond</PERSON>'s "health problems could be monitored within the prison system". 
  <PERSON> Bond</PERSON> was found guilty of improperly using his position as director of his former corporate flagship,
  <ORGANISATION> Bond Corporation Holdings</ORGANISATION>, to allow his private company to buy
  <PERSON> Edouard Manet</PERSON>'s La Promenade from
  <ORGANISATION> Bond Corp</ORGANISATION> for A$2.5 million (US$1.9 million), when its value was at least A$12 million. 
  <ORGANISATION> Bond's Dallhold Investments Pty Ltd</ORGANISATION> sold the painting a year later at auction in
  <LOCORG_CITY> New York</LOCORG_CITY> for A$17 million.

  <DATE> 1996-08-20</DATE> 
 
 Algerian security forces killed five Moslem rebels on Sunday night near
  <LOCORG_CITY> Algiers</LOCORG_CITY> and one person was wounded when a bomb exploded on Monday in a coffee shop in the northeastern town of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tizi-Ouzou</LOCORG_CITY>, Algerian newspapers said. 
 The 
  <ORGANISATION>newspaper Liberte</ORGANISATION> said the five rebels were killed at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Sidi el Kebir</LOCORG_CITY>, near the capital, and security forces seized weapons. 
  <ORGANISATION> Le Matin</ORGANISATION> said the coffee shop bomb was the second attack on a coffee shop in central
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tizi-Ouzou</LOCORG_CITY>, 90 km (55 miles) from
  <LOCORG_CITY> Algiers</LOCORG_CITY>. 
 A rash of bomb attacks against restaurants and coffee shops in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Algiers</LOCORG_CITY> and other towns in July killed more than 20 people, according to Algerian reports. 
 The government-appointed watchdog body,
  <ORGANISATION> Human Rights National Observatory</ORGANISATION> (
  <ORGANISATION>ONDH</ORGANISATION>), was quoted on Monday by
  <ORGANISATION> el Watan newspaper</ORGANISATION> as saying about 1,400 civilians have been killed in the past two years in bomb attacks, including booby-trapped cars, blamed on Moslem guerrillas. 
 An estimated 50,000 people, mostly Moslem militants and security forces members, have been killed in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Algeria</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s violence since early
  <DATE> 1992</DATE> when authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.

 Around $2,600 worth of foreign currency was stolen along with the jewellery, the police said. The women and the

  <ORGANISATION> Swedish engineering group Atlas Copco</ORGANISATION> said on Tuesday that the stronger crown had a nine percent negative hit on its earnings in the first half of
  <DATE> 1996</DATE>. 
 But, reporting a 12 percent rise in first-half profit after financial items, the company forecast earnings for the full year would still be higher than in
  <DATE> 1995</DATE> even though demand was expected to remain unchanged.   
 "Demand for the full year
  <DATE> 1996</DATE> is expected to remain unchanged compared to
  <DATE> 1995</DATE> levels, and earnings are expected to improve," the company said in a statement. 
 "Market conditions are, however, still uncertain," it added. 
  <ORGANISATION> Atlas</ORGANISATION> reported a 12 percent lift in profit after financial items to 1.57 billion crowns. 
 This profit included a gain of 342 million crowns related to the sale of
  <ORGANISATION> VOAC Hydraulics</ORGANISATION> and restructuring costs of 225 million crowns within the indsturial technology business area. 
 Sales for the half year rose six percent from a year ago to 12.37 billion crowns and orders received increased three percent to 12.98 billion crowns. 
 "The strengthening of the Swedish crown had, however, a negative effect of nine percent," the company said.

  <ORGANISATION> Austrian oil and chemicals group OMV AG</ORGANISATION> said on Tuesday its forecast for flat full-year earnings was based on a conservative outlook for polyolefins in the fourth quarter. 
  <PERSON> Finance director Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer</PERSON> told a news conference that polyolefin prices in the first half were already well below year-ago levels, squeezing refining and plastics margins.

 German cocoa buyers take back seat in summer lull. 
  <LOCORG_CITY> HAMBURG</LOCORG_CITY>
  <DATE> 1996-08-20</DATE> 

 German chocolate manufacturers have shunned cocoa markets during August after taking cover at around the 1,000 stg a tonne levels seen in
  <LOCORG_CITY> London</LOCORG_CITY> futures last month, traders said. 
 "Futures are trending higher and a strong sterling versus the mark is another deterrent," one said. 
 "The past few weeks have been the dullest in years." 
  <LOCORG_CITY> London</LOCORG_CITY> September was up six stg at 1,020 at 1030 GMT. 
 Industry was reasonably covered and not worried about price rallies while high summer temperatures discouraged chocolate consumption and some plants remained shut, traders said. 
 Market speculation focused on an
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Ivory Coast</LOCORG_COUNTRY> harvest around 800,000-900,000 tonnes, which could bring a deficit of around 150,000-250,000 tonnes in the
  <DATE> 1996/97</DATE> season. 
 "That's why I think the current consumer attitude might be dangerous given that fourth quarter prices may well be a few hundred sterling higher," another trader said. 
 "But it would be a creeping increase and there is also a danger of a price collapse if the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Ivory Coast</LOCORG_COUNTRY> suddenly comes up with record volumes and qualities," he said. 
 Ivorian beans were quoted at 2.30 marks per kg for Aug/Sept compared with 2.17 marks in late July while the fourth quarter
  <DATE> 1996 </DATE>and first quarter
  <DATE> 1997</DATE> price of 2.33 was up 0.09-0.11. 
 The cocoa butter ratio was marginally higher at 2.78 for <DATE>1996</DATE> dates, implying a 6.50 marks outright price for Aug/Sept and 6.45 for fourth quarter, liquid, ex-works. 
 The first quarter
  <DATE> 1997</DATE> ratio of 2.72 implied a mark price of 6.40.

 Budget hopes boost Australian stocks at open. 
  <LOCORG_CITY> SYDNEY</LOCORG_CITY>
  <DATE> 1996-08-20</DATE> 
 
 The Australian share market continued its climb at the opening on Tuesday with buying interest fuelled by expectations of a tight Federal budget from
  <PERSON>Treasurer Peter Costello</PERSON> later today. 
 The All Ordinaries index rose 13.2 points to 2,274.7, while September share index futures rose 11 points to 2,287, a 12.3 point premium to the underlying index. 
 The buoyancy of Monday afternoon had spilled over, with solid buying interest pushing the bourse to its highest level in nearly four months, brokers said. 
 "What people want from the budget is still pushing it. They expect
  <PERSON> Costello</PERSON> to be firm," said a
  <LOCORG_CITY> Sydney</LOCORG_CITY> broker. 
 With opening volume levels well up on recent starting levels, buyers had clearly jumped down from the fence they had occupied for the last week. 
 "Buyers from yesterday are still about and they have given it a bit of a go," the broker said. 
 The big banks remained in favour as did cylical stocks such as transport shares
  <ORGANISATION> Brambles and Mayne Nickless</ORGANISATION>. 
 Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about 14 to four, while about 41 percent of shares traded remained steady.

 French sugar intervention board
  <ORGANISATION> FIRS</ORGANISATION> said on Tuesday it held its
  <DATE> 1996/97</DATE> beet sugar yield estimate of 9.40 tonnes per hectare, from 9.87 in
  <DATE> 1995/96</DATE> following results of the second beet test by manufacturers. 
 "The test shows a slight improvement but it confirms the
  <DATE> 1996/97</DATE> campaign will not be exceptional. It would be premature at this stage to change our estimate and we will wait for the results of the third test before eventually adjusting the figures," a
  <ORGANISATION> FIRS</ORGANISATION> analyst told
  <ORGANISATION> Reuters</ORGANISATION>. 
  <ORGANISATION> Sugar manufacturers' association SNFS</ORGANISATION> said on Monday the test carried out on
  <DATE> August 12</DATE> showed sugar weight per hectare fell by 10.2 percent to 6.210 tonnes from 6.916 in last year's second test. 
 This represented a decline of 15 percent from the five-year average of 7.340 tonnes. 
 The number of beets per hectare fell to 101,500 from 109,600 but sugar content rose to 17.48 percent from 16.33 percent. 
 "The second test shows that drought stress is persisting and that a higher sugar content is not making up for a lower number of beets per hectare and a lower root weight," the analyst said. 
 She said the test figures were the lowest when compared to yearly averages since
  <DATE> 1991</DATE> and five-year averages for
  <DATE> 1981-85</DATE>,
  <DATE> 1986-90</DATE> and
  <DATE> 1991-95</DATE>. 
 In June
  <ORGANISATION> FIRS</ORGANISATION> predicted the sugar crop would drop to 3.9 million tonnes from 4.2 million in
  <DATE> 1995/96</DATE>, assuming a decline in area of 9,000 hectares to 420,000 ha. 
 Analyst have said the second test showed no significant crop improvement because the survey was conducted just as badly- needed rainfall hit the growing areas. The third test to be carried out on
  <DATE> August 26</DATE> should reflect the rain's positive effect, they said. --

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, which blocked the treaty last week, would veto its transmission to the
  <EVENT> U.N. General Assembly</EVENT> in
  <LOCORG_CITY> New York</LOCORG_CITY> for signature at the end of next month. 
 "Our opposition to that text continues,"
  <PERSON> Ghose</PERSON> told the conference. "We would not, therefore, agree to it being forwarded to the
  <ORGANISATION> UNGA</ORGANISATION> in any form by this conference." 
 Her remarks were greeted with anger by <LOCORG_COUNTRY>India</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s neighbour and long-time foe
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Pakistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. "Today, the mask of the smiling Buddha has been torn off, revealing the face of the goddess of war,"
  <PERSON> Pakistani ambassador Munir Akram</PERSON> told the conference. 
 "
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Pakistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> would regret any procedure that would circumvent the Conference on Disarmament, the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum," he added. 
 Yet supporters of the treaty, which include all five declared nuclear powers, hope to bypass
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s veto in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Geneva</LOCORG_CITY> and have the treaty signed anyway at the <EVENT>General Assembly</EVENT>. 
 The Conference on Disarmament, or CD, takes all decisions by consensus of its 61 member states. But if the treaty text were presented to the <EVENT>General Assembly</EVENT> in the form of a co-sponsored resolution, it would need only a simple majority of the 185 member states to be adopted -- although opponents of the treaty could also propose amendments to it. 
 It was not clear whether
  <PERSON> Ghose</PERSON>'s remark that the treaty could not be forwarded to
  <LOCORG_CITY> New York</LOCORG_CITY> "in any form" meant the CD would not be able even to transmit the negotiating report to the <EVENT>General Assembly</EVENT>. 
 That report clearly says there is no consensus on the text, but Western diplomats said that since it refers to the text it would be procedurally easier to introduce the treaty in
  <LOCORG_CITY> New York</LOCORG_CITY> if the report was forwarded. 
 If not, a co-sponsored resolution could be more difficult to introduce if the treaty were still to be open for signature from the end of September. 
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s main problem with the treaty is that it does not commit the five declared nuclear powers -- the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Russia</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> China</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> -- to a timetable for full nuclear disarmament, and instead encourages the divide between nuclear "haves" and "have nots". 
 After rejecting the treaty on those grounds,
  <LOCORG_CITY> New Delhi</LOCORG_CITY> was further angered when the draft text demanded that
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was among those that signed up to the treaty before it could enter into force. 
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, along with
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Pakistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, is one of three "nuclear threshold states" that have the capability to swiftly build nuclear weapons.
  <LOCORG_CITY> New Delhi</LOCORG_CITY> exploded a nuclear device in
  <DATE> 1974</DATE>, but has not undertaken any nuclear tests since then. 
  <PERSON> Ghose</PERSON> told the CD that
  <LOCORG_CITY> New Delhi</LOCORG_CITY> had led the call for a test ban treaty as far back as
  <DATE> 1954</DATE>, but the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Geneva</LOCORG_CITY> negotiations had ignored their mandate to negotiate a universal, balanced test ban. 
 She was particularly critical of the text's clause on entry-into-force, saying: "It is unprecedented in multilateral negotiations and international law that any sovereign country should be denied its right of voluntary consent on adherence to an international treaty."
