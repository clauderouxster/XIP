The use of the concept matching software

Using the software consists of three steps: configuring the PubMed
retrieval script, defining a list of keywords for the ranking,
and launching the software.

1. Configuring the PubMed retrieval script:

Several variables need to be configured in the script
ncbi-keywords-to-abstracts.pl.  Please read the instructions at the
beginning of that file, up to the line that says "End of configuration
variables."


2. Defining the list of keywords

Create a keyword file. Enter a list of keywords, one per line, to be used in calculating article scores.  * can be used as a wildcard.  Matching is case-insensitive if the pattern is in lowercase, case-sensitive if the pattern contains one or more capital letters.

3. Launching the software

bin/bk.sh <name_of_keyword_file> <name_of_output_file>
