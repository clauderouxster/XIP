The occurrence of tumors is accelerated in experiments that activate FGF proto-oncogenes or remove the tumor suppressor genes Pten or P53, implying that secondary oncogenic events are required for progression from mammary hyperplasia to carcinoma. <br><span style='background:#33CCFF;;mso-highlight:#33CCFF;'>PSSENT_PS'pmid$:15198801'(It is not known , however , which oncogenic pathways contribute to Wnt1-induced tumorigenesis - further experimental manipulation of these mice is needed .)</span><br>Secondary events also appear to be required for mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-Neu transgenic mice because the transgene in the tumors usually contains an acquired mutation that activates the Neu protein-tyrosine kinase.  Methods.  cDNA or DNA from the mammary glands and mammary tumors from MMTV-Wnt1, MMTV-Wnt1/p53-/-, MMTV-Neu transgenic mice, and newly generated MMTV-Wnt1/MMTV-Neu bitransgenic mice, was sequenced to seek activating mutations in H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras genes, or in the MMTV-Neu transgene. In addition, tumors from bitransgenic animals were examined to determine the cellular phenotype.  Results.  We found activating mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 of H-Ras in just over half of the mammary tumors in MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice, and we confirmed the high frequency of activating mutations of Neu in tumors in MMTV-Neu transgenic mice. Tumors appeared earlier in bitransgenic MMTV-Wnt1/MMTV-Neu mice, but no Ras or MMTV-Neu mutations were found in these tumors, which were phenotypically similar to those arising in MMTV-Wnt1 mice. In addition, no Ras mutations were found in the mammary tumors that arise in MMTV-Wnt1 transgenic mice lacking an intact P53 gene.  Conclusions.  Tumorigenic properties of cells undergoing functionally significant secondary mutations in H-Ras or the MMTV-Neu transgene allow selection of those cells in MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-Neu transgenic mice, respectively. Alternative sources of oncogenic potential, such as a second transgenic oncogene or deficiency of a tumor suppressor gene, can obviate the selective power of those secondary mutations. <br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>RELSENT_LASTSENT_STAT'pmid$:15198801'(These observations are consistent with the notion that somatic evolution of mouse mammary tumors is influenced by the specific nature of the inherited cancer - promoting genotype .)</span><br><br><br>15239829<br><br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>RELSENT_TITLE'pmid$:15239829'(Tissue - specific spatial organization of genomes .)</span><br>Background.

Results.  Genotyping was successful in 496 women, of whom 56 (11.3%) were found to carry a BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutation. After a median follow-up period of 116 months, breast cancer specific survival was worse in women with BRCA1 mutations than in those without (62% at 10 years versus 86%; ), but not in women with the BRCA2 mutation (84% versus 86% at 10 years; P = 0.76). Germline BRCA1 mutations were an independent predictor of breast cancer mortality in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.2-4.8; P = 0.01).

RESULTS. In a bilayer of 26 x 29 nm multiple pores form independently with sizes of up to 10 nm on a time scale of nanoseconds with an applied field of 0.5 V/nm. Pore formation is accompanied by curving of the bilayer. In smaller bilayers of ca. 6 x 6 nm, a single pore forms on a nanosecond time scale in lipid bilayers with applied fields of at least 0.4 V/nm, corresponding to transmembrane voltages of ca. 3 V. The presence of 1 M salt does not seem to change the mechanism. In an even simpler system, consisting of a 3 nm thick octane layer, pores also form, despite the fact that there are no charged headgroups and no salt in this system. In all cases pore formation begins with the formation of single-file like water defects penetrating into the bilayer or octane. CONCLUSIONS. The simulations suggest that pore formation is driven by local electric field gradients at the water/lipid interface. Water molecules move in these field gradients, which increases the probability of water defects penetrating into the bilayer interior. Such water defects cause a further increase in the local electric field, accelerating the process of pore formation. The likelihood of pore formation appears to be increased by local membrane defects involving lipid headgroups.

For adults, vitamin D intake of 100 mcg (4000 IU)/day is physiologic and safe. The adequate intake (AI) for older adults is 15 mcg (600 IU)/day, but there has been no report focusing on use of this dose.  Methods.  We compared effects of these doses on biochemical responses and sense of wellbeing in a blinded, randomized trial. In Study 1, 64 outpatients (recruited if summer 2001 25(OH)D 61 nmol/L) were given 15 or 100 mcg/day vitamin D in December 2001. Biochemical responses were followed at subsequent visits that were part of clinical care; 37 patients completed a wellbeing questionnaire in December 2001 and February 2002.

PAI-2 is reported to have anti-apoptotic activity, thus reduction of endogenous expression may be expected to make cells more sensitive to programmed cell death.  Results.  As expected, we encountered a cytotoxic phenotype when targeting the PAI-2 mRNA with vector-derived shRNA. However, this predicted phenotype was a potent non-specific effect of shRNA expression, as functional overexpression of the target protein failed to rescue the phenotype. By decreasing the shRNA length or modifying its sequence we maintained PAI-2 silencing and reduced, but did not eliminate, cytotoxicity. ShRNA of 21 complementary nucleotides (21 mers) or more increased expression of the oligoadenylate synthase-1 (OAS1) interferon-responsive gene. 19 mer shRNA had no effect on OAS1 expression but long-term selective pressure on cell growth was observed. By lowering lentiviral vector titre we were able to reduce both expression of shRNA and induction of OAS1, without a major impact on the efficacy of gene silencing.  Conclusions.  Our data demonstrate a rapid cytotoxic effect of shRNAs expressed in human tumor cell lines. There appears to be a cut-off of 21 complementary nucleotides below which there is no interferon response while target gene silencing is maintained. Cytotoxicity or OAS1 induction could be reduced by changing shRNA sequence or vector titre, but stable gene silencing could not be maintained in extended cell culture despite persistent marker gene expression from the RNAi-inducing transgene cassette. <br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>RELSENT_LASTSENT_STAT'pmid$:15291968'(These results underscore the necessity of careful controls for immediate and long-term RNAi use in mammalian cell systems .   )</span><br><br><br>11790800<br><br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>RELSENT_NEGATIVE_TITLE'pmid$:11790800'(Cadherin-mediated cell sorting not determined by binding or adhesion specificity .)</span><br>Cadherin adhesion molecules play important roles in the establishment of tissue boundaries.

Investigation of factors that affect stability, growth, and induction of T7 expression strains in shaking vessels led to the recognition that sporadic, unintended induction of expression in complex media, previously reported by others, is almost certainly caused by small amounts of lactose. Glucose prevents induction by lactose by well-studied mechanisms. Amino acids also inhibit induction by lactose during log-phase growth, and high rates of aeration inhibit induction at low lactose concentrations. These observations, and metabolic balancing of pH, allowed development of reliable non-inducing and auto-inducing media in which batch cultures grow to high densities. Expression strains grown to saturation in non-inducing media retain plasmid and remain fully viable for weeks in the refrigerator, making it easy to prepare many freezer stocks in parallel and use working stocks for an extended period. Auto-induction allows efficient screening of many clones in parallel for expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be inoculated and grown to saturation, and yields of target protein are typically several-fold higher than obtained by conventional IPTG induction.

Observational studies suggest that male circumcision may provide protection against HIV-1 infection. A randomized, controlled intervention trial was conducted in a general population of South Africa to test this hypothesis. METHODS AND FINDINGS. A total of 3,274 uncircumcised men, aged 18-24 y, were randomized to a control or an intervention group with follow-up visits at months 3, 12, and 21. Male circumcision was offered to the intervention group immediately after randomization and to the control group at the end of the follow-up. The grouped censored data were analyzed in intention-to-treat, univariate and multivariate, analyses, using piecewise exponential, proportional hazards models. Rate ratios (RR) of HIV incidence were determined with 95% CI. Protection against HIV infection was calculated as 1 - RR. The trial was stopped at the interim analysis, and the mean (interquartile range) follow-up was 18.1 mo (13.0-21.0) when the data were analyzed. There were 20 HIV infections (incidence rate = 0.85 per 100 person-years) in the intervention group and 49 (2.1 per 100 person-years) in the control group, corresponding to an RR of 0.40 (95% CI. 0.24%-0.68%; p 0.001). This RR corresponds to a protection of 60% (95% CI. 32%-76%). When controlling for behavioural factors, including sexual behaviour that increased slightly in the intervention group, condom use, and health-seeking behaviour, the protection was of 61% (95% CI. 34%-77%).

Male circumcision provides a degree of protection against acquiring HIV infection, equivalent to what a vaccine of high efficacy would have achieved. <br><span style='background:#ddffdd;;mso-highlight:#ddffdd;'>PSRELSENT_LASTSENT_POSTAT_PS'pmid$:16231970'(Male circumcision may provide an important way of reducing the spread of HIV infection in sub - Saharan Africa .)</span><br>(Preliminary and partial results were presented at the International AIDS Society 2005 Conference, on 26 July 2005, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.).<br><br>15509656<br><br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>RELSENT_TITLE'pmid$:15509656'(A small C - terminal sequence of Aurora B is responsible for localization and function .)</span><br>Aurora B, a protein kinase required in mitosis, localizes to inner centromeres at metaphase and the spindle midzone in anaphase and is required for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis.

BACKGROUND. Protein phosphorylation is an extremely important mechanism of cellular regulation. A large-scale study of phosphoproteins in a whole-cell lysate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has previously identified 383 phosphorylation sites in 216 peptide sequences. However, the protein kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of the identified proteins have not previously been assigned. RESULTS. We used Predikin in combination with other bioinformatic tools, to predict which of 116 unique protein kinases in yeast phosphorylates each experimentally determined site in the phosphoproteome. The prediction was based on the match between the phosphorylated 7-residue sequence and the predicted substrate specificity of each kinase, with the highest weight applied to the residues or positions that contribute most to the substrate specificity. We estimated the reliability of the predictions by performing a parallel prediction on phosphopeptides for which the kinase has been experimentally determined. CONCLUSIONS. The results reveal that the functions of the protein kinases and their predicted phosphoprotein substrates are often correlated, for example in endocytosis, cytokinesis, transcription, replication, carbohydrate metabolism and stress response. <br><span style='background:#33CCFF;;mso-highlight:#33CCFF;'>PSSENT_WEAKCONTR'pmid$:16445868'(The predictions link phosphoproteins of unknown function with protein kinases with known functions and vice versa , suggesting functions for the uncharacterized proteins .)</span><br>The study indicates that the phosphoproteins and the associated protein kinases represented in our dataset have housekeeping cellular roles; certain kinases are not represented because they may only be activated during specific cellular responses. <br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>RELSENT_LASTSENT_POSTAT'pmid$:16445868'(Our results demonstrate the utility of our previously reported protein kinase substrate prediction approach ( Predikin ) as a tool for establishing links between kinases and phosphoproteins that can subsequently be tested experimentally .)</span><br><br><br>16449188<br>The authors use a combination of bioinformatics methods to predict substrates for the 116 protein kinases in yeast and, importantly, assess the reliability of their predictions by reference to experimental data. <br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>RELSENT_POSTAT_SYNTH'pmid$:16449188'(This study is a powerful demonstration of the way in which the Predkin kinase substrate prediction method previously developed by these authors can give functional insights into signalling networks .)</span><br><br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>LOGIC_CONTR'pmid$:16449188'(Their results show that the functions of many protein kinases and their predicted phosphoprotein substrates are correlated , and this information allows phosphoproteins of unknown function to be associated with protein kinases with known functions and vice versa .)</span><br><br><span style='background:#ddffdd;;mso-highlight:#ddffdd;'>PSRELSENT_LASTSENT_POSTAT'pmid$:16449188'(Thus , this approach can suggest functions for proteins and may serve as a useful tool for devising experiments to probe the function of signalling networks .)</span><br><br>PMID:16449188  ***Abstract type: split***<br><br>16449188<br><br><span style='background:yellow;;mso-highlight:yellow;'>RELSENT_TITLE'pmid$:16449188'(Asynchronous nuclear division cycles in multinucleated cells .)</span><br>Synchronous mitosis is common in multinucleated cells.
