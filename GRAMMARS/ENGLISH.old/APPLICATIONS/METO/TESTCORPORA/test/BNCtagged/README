This format contains the countries and companies 
files,  including tokenisation and tagging
from the original BNC files as well as metonymy annotation.
As these are the test files for SemEval, all reading information was replaced by
reading="unknown" for the participants.
The file names are countries.test.BNCtagged and companies.test.BNCtagged.


At the beginning of each sample in *.sample, in the element bncsource, part
of the source file description for each sample as given in 
the BNC is included. This gives e.g., the BNC file reference, the reference to
the original text file and the text category of the file (for example, spoken
or written). For description of these categories please refer
to the BNC User Reference guide, available at the BNC website (http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk).



Several procedures have been undertaken to normalize the text samples
(*.samples) in this corpus. Firstly, our extraction software Gsearch
 does not print some
elements in the BNC (e.g., empty elements serving to indicate noises
in speech transcription). Therefore the samples only include all the
words and punctuation in the BNC original sample. Secondly, the files
were converted from SGML into XML. Thirdly, namespaces were introduced
to distinguish the original BNC markup from the markup added during
the annotation phase of this project. Therefore all elements and
attributes that are taken from the original BNC markup have the prefix
'bnc:'. So, e.g., the part of speech annotation is marked with the
attribute bnc:type. For description of these elements and attributes
we refer the user to the BNC User Reference Guide. Fourth, identifiers
to the sentences, words and punctuation elements have been added.
These identifiers give pointers to the elements' position in the BNC
files from which the elements were extracted. Thus, e.g., at the
beginning of each sample the element 'refer' gives reference to the
original BNC file as well as the sentencenumber of this file in which
the studied name occurs. As another example, every word element has an
id-number of the form 'samp*-bnc*-s*-w*' : The sample number allows to
locate the sample within this corpus; the references to the BNC file
number, the sentence in this file and the word number in that sentence
make it possible to link the word back to the original BNC file.
