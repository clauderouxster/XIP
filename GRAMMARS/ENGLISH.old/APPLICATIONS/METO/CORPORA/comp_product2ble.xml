NIGEL MANSELL may be about to give Formula One a much-needed lift when he competes in his first Indycar race at the street circuit of Surfers' Paradise in Queensland, Australia, on Sunday. 
The reigning world champion, who turned his back on Formula One after he was outmanoeuvred by Alain Prost last season, has established himself as runaway favourite to win the Indycar championship. 
Mansell has so dominated pre-season testing in his Ford-powered Lola that he is expected to win on Sunday by the large margin familiar during his dominance of Grand Prix racing in the <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-product"> Williams Renault </org></annot> last season. 
If he does, the result will be interpreted as long-awaited proof that Formula One is the world's leading motor racing formula -- a belief given added weight by Indycar champion Michael Andretti's disastrous showing in his debut at the South African Grand Prix last weekend.
