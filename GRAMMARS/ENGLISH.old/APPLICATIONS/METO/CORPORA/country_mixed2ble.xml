Initiated by France and the United Kingdom, the summit had reportedly been convened to grant de facto recognition to the permanent membership of Russia which, on Dec. 24, had informed the UN of its intention to assume membership of all UN organs previously held by the former Soviet Union. 
Other press reports indicated that the summit had been conceived to reinforce the position of the UK and France. 
Their privileges as permanent Security Council members, especially the right of veto, had been increasingly questioned by <annot><location reading="mixed" notes="litpeople"> Germany </location></annot> and Japan which, as major economic powers, had allegedly claimed permanent membership of the Council. 
Argentina, Brazil, India and Nigeria were also understood to have favoured an enlargement of the Council's permanent composition.

Turkey's primary interest is in gaining access to the European Community and Ankara believes that support for the West in the Gulf will hasten the day when Brussels will have to admit, albeit reluctantly, its first Muslim partner.

However, given the level of popular support for Iraq in the other countries, King Hassan's decision to support the Egyptian line wholeheartedly was generally considered risky. 
King Hassan, the Maghreb's sole reigning monarch, had issued a swift and strong condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and he went on to vote in favour of the resolution adopted at the Cairo summit. 
Morocco subsequently became one of only three Arab countries (i.e. together with Egypt and <annot><location reading="mixed" notes="litpeople"> Syria </location></annot>) to send troops to the pan-Arab force to defend Saudi Arabia; some 1,200 Moroccan troops reportedly arrived in Riyadh on Aug. 12.

In response to the increase in unemployment in Europe, rising from 2.6 million in 1974 to 6.5 million in 1980, the ESF was quadrupled. 
This rise in unemployment and the lack of a clear set of objectives led in 1983 to a simplification and concentration of its activities.

Any decision on taxation has to be taken by the member states unanimously and there now seems little hope that the Commission can deflect them from the course they set out upon yesterday. 
Perhaps more grave, however, is the fact that still more contentious aspects of the plan are also still unresolved, notably the extent to which governments can be persuaded to approximate their highly divergent rates of VAT Excise duties. 
Three countries -- Denmark, <annot><location reading="mixed" notes="litpeople"> Ireland </location></annot> and Belgium -- meanwhile indicated yesterday that they remain opposed to another key element, which forsees the abolition of all limits on tax-paid goods that can be carried across borders by private travellers. 
These governments fear a vast loss of revenue to the low-rate neighbour countries if these limits -- so-called " travellers " allowances' -- are abandoned.

It is perhaps in the surviving pre-Conquest books more than anywhere that we can find a clue to Lanfranc's impatient determination to make a completely new start with the monastic life at Canterbury. 
Among all the books which have survived -- and nearly seventy have now been identified -- there is not a single volume of the basic works of Patristic theology or of recent scholastic learning, which (as we have seen) were conspicuous in the library at Bec, and were to be equally conspicuous at Canterbury after Lanfranc had restored the library. 
Moreover, in none of these surviving volumes is there any sign of interest or skill in the rapidly developing scholastic disciplines of northern <annot><location reading="mixed" notes="litpeople"> France </location></annot> and Lorraine at this time. 
Some of the gaps must be due to chance, but there is no mistaking the insularity of interest which these volumes display.
