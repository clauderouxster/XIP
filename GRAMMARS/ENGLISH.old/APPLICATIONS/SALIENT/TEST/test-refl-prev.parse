SENT(Internship Interview and Process .)
SENT(The company where I took my first internship is called ' Wired and Wireless Solutions International ' .)
SENT(In this report WWSI will be used as an abbreviation for the company name .)
SENT(This junior internship position was found on I2MS .)
SENT(Before securing the internship position at WWSI , I have gone through several other interviews across a broad range of engineering disciplines .)
SENT(This consisted of both group interviews and individual interviews .)
SENT(However , I was not successful in securing any of these positions .)
SENT(.)
REFLSENT_COMPLEX_SPECIFIC(Prior going to the interview at WWSI , I_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ reflected_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ on what occurred in the other interviews and thought_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ about why_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+ I wasn't successful in those interviews .)

REFLSENT_VAGUE_SURFACEREFL(The majority of my_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ reflection_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ was drawn from the second last interview which I had with Attaché Software .)
SENT(The interviewer not only interviewed me but also educated me in several ways .)
SENT(The interview started as a group interview consisting of five candidates completing quizzes and personality tests .)
SENT(The interviewer then took us one by one to conduct individual interviews .)
SENT(At the end we were told that only one candidate would be offered the position and that the position was between me and another candidate .)
SENT(I knew they would choose him because it was his second internship , he is more experienced than me and the most important factor was that I did not perform well during the individual interview .)
SENT(.)
REFLSENT_COMPLEX_SPECIFIC_SHIFT(From that interview , I_SHIFTINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ realized_SHIFTINDICATOR:+_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ what my weaknesses were when compared_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ to other candidates and my intention was to improve on these weaknesses and successfully secure an internship .)

CONCEPT_REFLSENT(confidence)
SENT(I was very nervous at the time , I knew I had to find a way to stay calm and present the best of me to the employer as interviews are only a short time for the employer to see what potentials you have and what you can bring to the company .)
SENT(I did some research on interview techniques .)
REFLSENT_COMPLEX_SPECIFIC(I_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ found_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ that the way to present your attributes and skills is_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ essential .)
CONCEPT_REFLSENT(attributes)
CONCEPT_REFLSENT(skills)
SENT(The sequence in which you deliver the skills you want to express does matter and will affect the interviewer , eg ; ' intelligent > industrious > impulsive > critical > stubborn > envious ' to describe yourself .)
SENT(It will have a more positive effect on the interviewers rather than if you start with envious and work your way backwards because the stubbornness of an intelligent person is seen as likely to be justified and may actually evoke respect , but intelligence in an envious and stubborn person makes him more dangerous and unreliable , this is known as the halo effect .)
REFLSENT_VAGUE_SURFACEREFL(I followed this guide line and had this in mind_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ for my next internship_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ .)

CONCEPT_REFLSENT(next,internship_INDICATOR:+_MD:+)
SENT(During the interview with WWSI , On of the senior partner and HR manager interviews me .)
SENT(I tend to cope with individual interviews more comfortably .)
SENT(I presented my strength and weaknesses in confidence .)
SENT(I performed the halo effect on the two interviewers .)
SENT(It seemed to work as I was informed the next day that I have secured the position .)
SENT(In the future with other interviews , there are aspects in which I need improve on .)
SENT(For example I noticed when applying for positions on I2MS or other websites , I did not receive much replies .)
SENT(I assumed that it may be the fact that too many candidates applied .)
SENT(But after close investigation and research i concluded that my resume did not provide substantial information that meets the criteria of the position .)
REFLSENT_COMPLEX_SPECIFIC(I_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ reviewed my resume and found_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ that I used_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ the same resume for all internship application .)

CONCEPT_REFLSENT(interview,skills)
SENT(Many videos online illustrate how to be successful in a interview .)
SENT(It presents different ways to prepare for individual and group interview .)
SENT(One important factor i picked up is to bring a spare copy of the resume for yourself to view as the interview progresses .)
SENT(I have taken into account these tips and I am planning on visiting workshops or online resources to broaden my skills .)
SENT(The other factor became obvious when I started my job search .)
SENT(Telecommunications engineering involves a range of different engineering disciplines .)
SENT(Such as networking , electrical and IT .)
SENT(Programming is very important as many of the internship positions require some level of programming skills .)
SENT(I plan on revising what I learnt in Embedded C and advance into different programming languages .)
SENT(I have used www.code.org to learn and study with different people on different programming languages .)
SENT(This website is a free and open source platform where anyone can learn to program .)
SENT(It is very convenient and can be used anywhere with internet access .)
REFLSENT_COMPLEX_SHIFT(It had already broadened_SHIFTINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ my_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ knowledge_SHIFTINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ about programming and with persistence and time it will advance my programming skills to industry level .)

SENT(Company Structure / Outline .)
SENT(My first internship started on 27 / 2 / 2013 and ended on 15 /8 / 2013 with a duration of 24 weeks .)
SENT(WWSI has three different sectors around the world including Sydney , Asia and North America .)
SENT(I was stationed in Sydney , the company 's headquarter .)
SENT(WWSI is located on level 7 , 6 Help street Chatswood .)
SENT(WWSI is a private company and is classified as small to medium enterprise .)

SENT(Some of the projects that i was involved in include setting up mesh network with free WIFI at Double Bay Council , Anzac stadium and World Square in Town hall Sydney .)
SENT(.)
SENT(The company already had two interns when i first started .)
SENT(One of the intern is called Anthony , he worked in WWSI for 3 month and is at the end of his internship .)
SENT(He taught me and the other intern how to assemble and program many of the systems that we manufacture .)
SENT(I worked harder to make sure i could keep up the work when Anthony left the company .)
SENT(The systems weren't hard to assemble and program , but I needed more practice to become faster and more accurate .)
SENT(This wasn't the first time that I had hands on experience , unlike other people at the same age ; I have already gone through many jobs .)
REFLSENT_SIMPLEVAL_SURFACEREFL_ANALYTIC_CONTRAST(But_MD:+ it was very interesting_MD:+ working_MD:+ in the field_MD:+ you are studying in .)
SENT(.)
SENT(My supervisor Karthick .)
SENT(He is skilled in wireless transmission technology .)
SENT(I had to bond with my supervisor and other people in the company as I wish to learn more from them .)
SENT(Some of the project Karthick worked on is Anzac Stadium , this project was still in the planning phase and our company have been chosen to design , survey and install routers to provide full WIFI coverage of the entire stadium .)
SENT(I had a look at the CAD ( auto cad files ) files of the stadium and discussed with Karthick .)
SENT(My role in the company is the intern .)
SENT(I was involved in many projects , duress systems and troubleshooting .)

SENT(As my time in the company elapsed , I got more involved in the operation and routine of the company .)
SENT(Projects and small assignments were always passed on to me to finish or to document in the system .)
SENT(Although it was a vague process , i still gained some experience in managing documentations and communications between each department .)
SENT(.)
SENT(One instance of this is when Peter gave instructions to figure out a way to remotely switch off and on a server which Is located in Singapore .)
SENT(Team viewer ( software that allows two pc to connect and share connection ) can be used to achieve the remote control over the long distance .)
SENT(I searched online for products that act as a switch and a device that controls that switch .)
REFLSENT_COMPLEX_SPECIFIC(I_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ found_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ the Damocles Mini which was a device that acts like a control Centre_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ .)

CONCEPT_REFLSENT(Power Egg)
CONCEPT_REFLSENT(power,switch)
SENT(I placed an order for the two items .)
SENT(I started going through the manuals of these two devices , I needed to figure out how to connect these two devices together and also within the network .)
SENT(When the device arrived in the Company I was able to take a look and start assembling straight away .)
SENT(.)
SENT(First I used a computer ( which is used to be similar to a server ) I connected the power cable from the computer through to the Power Egg , the other end of the Power Egg into the wall socket .)
SENT(Then using the dry contacts on the Power Egg , I connected the Damocles Mini to it using stranded wires .)
SENT(Next stage is connecting the Damocles to the computer with a Ethernet cable , set the IP address of my computer to match the Damocles mini and start up the web interface .)
SENT(The setup is quite easy and I got the device working straight away , I was able to shut off the computer and turn on the computer from anywhere within the network .)
SENT(After a series of tests over various devices and networks .)
SENT(I concluded that this setup is suitable for the Singapore servers .)
SENT(Before i disassembled the connections and pack it .)

SENT(Documenting an official report needs to follow the companies guidelines .)
SENT(Text need to be in Times New Roman with size of 12 and spacing of 1 .)
SENT(It needs to have a company letter head , person who signed off the report .)
SENT(Report must be in professional engineering language and correct format .)
SENT(.)
SENT(I also encountered a problem other technician could not solve .)
SENT(It happened to a few of the customer who ordered the Mini - Pacc system with a man down transmitter .)
SENT(They had trouble with the transmitter triggering the Mini - Pacc system .)
SENT(I got a few calls asking me to troubleshoot their system , after going through all the problems .)
SENT(I was not able to fix their system , so I had to ask them to send back the system , so I could take a closer look .)
SENT(After I got the system I figured out that it was the transmitter 's problem , the transmitter was designed to say if the carrier falls on the ground , the man down transmitter will trigger the mini - pacc system .)
REFLSENT_COMPLEX_SPECIFIC_CONTEXT(I_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ found_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ that when_CONTEXTINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ the clients don't return_CONTEXTINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ the device to its original state in this case the vertical stance , the Mini - pacc system does not recognize_SPECIFICINDICATOR:+_INDICATOR:+_MD:+ that the carrier has been rescued and stood back up .)

SENT(Later down the track i had a tense moment with Peter and was not sure how to deal with it .)
SENT(Peter handed me a small project involving setting up a 3G router .)
SENT(The router was setup and ready to go .)
SENT(But I got carried away with TWIG programming and helping Karthick with ideas for a new project .)
SENT(I forgot the 3G router task Peter gave me .)
SENT(At the end of the day , Peter came down and spoke with me .)
SENT(He mentioned if i had finished the task and why didn't i report back to him .)
SENT(I told him I was carried away with other matters .)
SENT(He pulled over a chair and sat down with me .)

SENT(When I got my first technical call , I was really nervous since I was not familiar with the products and therefore the lack in confidence when customers ask certain technical questions .)
SENT(This has been proven fatal when troubleshooting .)

SENT(Double bay project has gone through 1 / 3 now .)
SENT(Karthick and I started to fix two access points on to movable poles that we carry around the site .)

SENT(Then all the other access points on the poles will be connected to the root access point wirelessly .)
SENT(This will create the mesh network and allow the ZoneFlex to control the network , monitoring each user 's usage and time ) .)
SENT(I knew it 's going to get really busy , so I applied my time management method I created earlier in my internship .)

SENT(I took notes where ever I can and took photos in case I forget something later on .)

SENT(And what I do could easily determine ones situation .)
SENT(Because of this reason I took this system very seriously as I want the customer using this system to be safe when emergency occurs .)
SENT(TWIG Protector :)
SENT(This is a device that has saved many lives .)
SENT(This device can be carried in the pocket just like a normal cell phone , but when emergency occurs customers can press a SOS button on the device to trigger an SOS cycle which calls all the numbers programmed in the device and it will send out SMS to all numbers .)
SENT(It will establish a call with the designated number to allow emergency live coverage .)
SENT(TWIG also has a man down alarm , which will trigger when the device is tilted in a specified angle .)
