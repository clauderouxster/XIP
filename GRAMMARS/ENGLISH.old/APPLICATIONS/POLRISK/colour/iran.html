Georgy Kaurov, spokesman for Russia's atomic energy minister, announces that Russia will build two more nuclear reactors in Iran in addition to Russia's $850 million deal to build a 1000MW nuclear power plant at Bushehr. Kaurov says Russia " agreed in principle" with Iran on the construction of two more reactors at Bushehr. Russia and Iran initially signed a contract on 8 January 1995 for the first reactor at Bushehr. Russia took over construction of the reactor at Bushehr in February 1998 due to delays by Iran. <br>
