<TEXT>In an Iranian television interview, Hassan Rowhani, secretary-general of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, declares that Iran will decide by mid-March whether to continue negotiations with the European Union. He says Iran has repeatedly told Europe it would be willing to hold nuclear talks for months, not years, as long as they are fruitful.

He stresses the importance of Iranian solidarity in the face of U.S. threats, reiterating that the IAEA has repeatedly declared there is no proof of Iran pursuing a nuclear weapons production program and declaring there is "no place for nuclear weapons" in Iran's defense doctrine. Rowhani dismisses the possibility of a U.S. military attack given Iran's cooperation with the IAEA and European Union, suggesting that anyway, Iran's nuclear capability is impervious to bombs and missiles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Decrying an "eerie similarity to the events preceding the Iraq war," former Iraq Survey Group leader David Kay urges cautious appraisal of next steps given the escalating rhetoric emanating from Washington regarding Iran's nuclear capability and intentions. He reminds readers that Iran is fully cooperating with the international inspection regime; despite admitting to concealing 18 years of nuclear activities, Iran claims ambitions to nuclear power only, and the IAEA has found no evidence of a nuclear weapons program. In particular, Kay advocates a set of measures tying Iran's nuclear activities to peaceful uses so that any departure is easily detectable; warns against "evidence" provided by regime dissidents with their own agenda; acknowledges the helpfulness of IAEA inspections; urges caution of overheated official rhetoric unsupported by evidence, which serves only to undermine constructive efforts; advocates serious analysis of the evidence available - not to rush or "cook" a National Intelligence Estimate on Iranian nuclear activities.</TEXT>

<TEXT>EU trio diplomats complain that "we are on the defensive now" in nuclear negotiations due to resume with Iran on April 29th. Talks now center on the Iranian proposal versus its cessation of uranium enrichment. Iran's proposal includes building up its enrichment program in stages under close monitoring by the IAEA, eventually to be expanded into a commercial-scale enrichment plant with 54,000 centrifuges, producing low-grade enriched uranium for power plants. According to nuclear experts, a 3,000-centrifuge strength plant could produce enough highly-enriched uranium for one and a half warheads per year.</TEXT>

According to secret documents viewed by Der Spiegel, Iran instructs its South Korean partners to purchase materials from, for example, the French-based company EADS Sodern, once in South Korea the items are shipped to Iran.  Through this method, where the seller is not aware of the final buyer, Iran has purchased 300 units of Nickel 63 and tritium targets.  Both items are considered dual-use products which can be used to build a nuclear bomb or as part of a peaceful nuclear energy reactor.</TEXT>

The Iranian Mission further states that the negotiations are not proceeding and that the EU-3 goal is to keep the suspension in place.  In light of the IAEA Board of Governors underlining the suspension as "a voluntary, non-legal binding confidence building measure," Iran announces it will resume the uranium conversion activities at the Uranium Conversion Facility (UCF) on 1 August 2005.  Iran is committed to non-proliferation and a zone free of WMD in the Middle East, therefore the Islamic Republic of Iran will "continue in good faith and in an expeditious and result-oriented manner, its negotiations with E3/EU," the Iranian Mission concludes.</TEXT>

As of 29 August, no UF4 had been produced as a result of that processing. From the 21 tonnes of uranium in the form of UF4 produced during the previous campaign, approximately 8500 kg of uranium in the form of UF4 was fed into the UF4 to UF6 process line; approximately 6800 kg of uranium in the form of UF6 was produced there from. In a letter dated 29 August 2005, Iran informed the IAEA of its intention to start moving the remaining inventory of UOC to the new storage area, and that it would likely take two months."</TEXT>

<TEXT>IAEA Director-General Mohammad ElBaradei releases a report outlining the implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The report provides a summary of past resolutions, findings as of November 2004, developments since November 2004, the current overall assessment, and suspension. Director ElBaradei states that Iran has made "good progress" in correcting breaches, but there are still two important issues that need to be resolved in order to provide assurance that there are no undeclared enrichment activities in Iran: "the origin of LEU and HEU particle contamination found at various locations in Iran; and the extent of Iran's efforts to import, manufacture and use centrifuges of both the P-1 and P-2 designs." Based on current information, it appears the origin of the HEU contamination is mostly of foreign origin. However, a definitive conclusion with respect to all of the contamination, particularly the LEU contamination can not be determined at this time. "With respect to the second issue -- the P-1 and P-2 centrifuge programmes -- the Agency has not yet been able to verify the correctness and completeness of Iran's statements concerning those programmes. No additional information or documentation has been provided with respect to Iran's statement that it did not pursue any work on the P-2 design between 1995 and 2002," ElBaradei adds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad addresses the United Nations and says some 'powerful' states are preventing free access to technology, specifically nuclear technology. Ahmadinejad claims these same powerful countries have misrepresented Iran's intentions and are using propaganda to discredit their peaceful use of nuclear technology. He further invites other states and private companies to help with the program as a means of confidence-building measure. The following is a summary of direct quotes by President Ahmadinejad outlining the main elements of the initiatives regarding the nuclear issues: 1. The Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates its previously and repeatedly declared position that in accordance with our religious principles, pursuit of nuclear weapons is prohibited. 2. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that it is necessary to revitalise the NPT and create the above-mentioned ad-hoc committee so that it can combat nuclear weapons and abolish the apartheid in peaceful nuclear technology. 3. Technically, the fuel cycle of the Islamic Republic of Iran is not different from that of other countries which have peaceful nuclear technology. 4. In keeping with Iran's inalienable right to have access to a nuclear fuel cycle, continued interaction and technical and legal cooperation with the IAEA will be the centrepiece of our nuclear policy...With this in mind, I have directed the relevant Iranian officials to compile the legal and technical details, of Iran's nuclear approach, based on the following considerations: 5. The Islamic Republic of Iran, in its pursuit of peaceful nuclear technology, considers it within its legitimate rights to receive objective guarantees for uranium enrichment in the nuclear fuel cycle. 6. The selection of our negotiating partners and the continuation of negotiations with the EU will be commensurate with the requirements of our cooperation with the agency regarding non-diversion of the process of uranium enrichment to non-peaceful purposes in the framework of the provisions of the NPT. 7. The discriminatory approaches regarding the NPT that focuses on the obligations of state-parties and disregards their rights under the Treaty should be discontinued.</TEXT>
