Chris Dance

Chris Dance is the laboratory manager of Xerox's European Research Centre in France and manager of its image processing research area. He has been the main contributor to the broad ranging innovation that will bring value to Xerox from the new generation of digital and phone cameras. His imaging team is devising the next wave of automated image enhancement technologies for print shop workflows and has developed the first ever platform for using mobile phones to capture document images. Behind these systems are over 30 patented techniques to overcome the huge set of problems arising from the use of cameras rather than conventional scanners. These technologies range from intuitive user interfaces for small displays through to sophisticated algorithms for ensuring reliable text recognition (OCR) from low resolution, blurry images with shadows. His team also produced the world's first system that is capable of automatically recognizing diverse everyday visual object categories in real-world imaging conditions: this work took place within the EC project LAVA (Learning for Adaptable Visual Assistants, 2002-2005) which Chris coordinated.

Chris joined Xerox Research Centre Europe (XRCE) in 1997, after completing a BA in Theoretical Physics, a PhD in Information Engineering and a Research Assistantship, all at Cambridge University. He became Project Leader in XRCE's Collaborative Multimedia Systems group in 1998, Competency Leader in 2000, Area Manager in 2003 and Laboratory Manager in 2005.
