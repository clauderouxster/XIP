        <H2>information about ant</H2>
        <P>
            We are using ant version 1.7.0. <br>
            To get more information about ant:<a href="http://ant.apache.org"> click here </a> <br>
            By default ant uses the file named "build.xml" in the directory where ant is launched. <br>
            <br>
            In the "parSem/common" directory there are some xml files which are includes in the different "build.xml" files
            (all these include files are included by including the file parSem/common/buildInclude.xml"). <br>
            <H3>information files in parSem/common directory</H3>
            <ul>
                <li><i>parSem/common/debug.xml</i> allows to turn off/on debug compilation flag. 
                <li><i>parSem/common/version.xml</i> defines the version of each componant of xip(fst, ntm,...). 
                <li><i>parSem/common/compilerProperties.xml</i> Defines compiler properties for each platform. 
                <li><i>parSem/common/platformProperties.xml</i> Defines platform dependant properties. 
                <li><i>parSem/common/properties.xml</i> Defines common properties. 
                <li><i>parSem/common/ftp.xml</i> Defines some target to use FTP. 
                <li><i>parSem/common/archive.xml</i> Defines some target to archive the source code and the delivery . 
            </ul>
            <H3>ant usage</H3>
            ant --help give the list of ant options.<br><br>
            Two options are usefull: <br>
            <ul>
                <li> -v  it's the verbose mode
                <li> -p  lists all the target provided by the build.xml file in the current directory. 
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li> ant usage in the "parSem" directory
                <ul>
                    <li> ant clean:  remove the directories used for the build for all the subproject <b>ONLY for the current platform</b>.
                    <li> ant cleanAll:  remove the directories used for the build for all the subproject <b>for all the platforms</b>.
                    <li> ant compile: launch "ant compile" for each subproject on the current platform  
                    <li> ant compileAll: launch "ant compile" for each subproject on the solaris and linux platform (ant compile must be also launch on a windows platform)  
                    <li> ant delivery: launch "ant delivery" for each subproject on the solaris and linux platform (ant delivery must be also launch on a windows platform)  
                    <li> ant all: same as ant clean + ant compile + ant delivery
                    <li> ant full: same as ant cleanAll + ant compileAll + ant delivery
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li> ant usage in the "parSem/subProject/dev" directories (with subProject equals to ntm or fst, xip, ...)
                <ul>
                    <li> ant clean:  remove the directories used for the build  <b>ONLY for the current platform</b>.
                    <li> ant cleanAll:  remove the directories used for the build <b>for all the platforms</b>.
                    <li> ant compile: compile all the source codes (c, c++, java, library, executable) for the current platform  
                    <li> ant compileAll: launch "ant compile" on the solaris and linux platform (ant compile must be also launch on a windows platform)
                    <li> ant delivery:  generate in "parSem/subProject/delivery" directory a zip file (and the zipped directory) which includes all the files required in a delivery 
                    <li> ant archive:  generate in "parSem/subProject/archive" directory a zip file which includes all the sources code (dev directory) and the delivery zip file
                </ul>
