After the disbanding of the Clash, he acted in a few movies, recorded
movie soundtracks (notably "Love Kills" for the film /Sid and Nancy
/) and experimented with different backing bands
with limited success. Finally, in the mid- to late-1990s, Strummer
gathered top-flight musicians into a backing band he called The
Mescaleros . Strummer
signed with the Californian  punk label Hellcat
Records , and issued a
stunning album co-written with Anthony Genn, called /Rock Art and the
X-Ray Style/. A tour of England and North America soon followed; sets
included several Clash-fan favourites.
