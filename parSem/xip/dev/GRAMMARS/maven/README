Tools for packing a grammar into a jar file, encrypted, and
installing/deploying it as a maven artifact. The artifact can then be
used in a maven project that uses the JXip3 library.

I wrote a maven plugin that uses xip to find all the grammar (and FST)
files used by a grm file, encrypt them, and copy them into
target/classes, under a directory. Once this is done, the files are
packaged in a jar by the usual maven jar plugin.

See ../ENGLISH/APPLICATIONS/EUROPEANA/pom.xml for an example pom. It
inherits from ./pom.xml, and configures the following parameters of
the grammar-maven-plugin:

  grmRoot: a directory under which all of the files of the grammar
  will be found.

  grmFile: the grammar's .grm file

  grmPackage: a java package absolute path, using / as separator. The
  grammar files will be placed in that package in the jar.

A grammar can be packaged and installed for local testing as follows:

  cd parSem/xip/dev/GRAMMARS/ENGLISH/APPLICATIONS/EUROPEANA
  mvn install

mvn release does not work: the release plugin only works if the
pom.xml file is at the root of the directory hierarchy, which is not
the case for the ParSem grammars (e.g. the root is ENGLISH, and the
pom is in ENGLISH/APPLICATIONS/EUROPEANA).  I have therefore written
the shell script ./grammar-parent/release to perform releases. Use it
as follows:

  cd parSem/xip/dev/GRAMMARS/ENGLISH/APPLICATIONS/EUROPEANA
  ../../../maven/grammar-parent/release


The Galateas and Europeana grammar jars include, in addition to the
grammar itself, descriptors that are used by the web service
software. They are found under the src directory, e.g. for the English
Europeana gramamr:

   src/main/resources/com/xerox/xrce/europeana/grammars/xip-en.properties
   src/main/resources/com/xerox/xrce/europeana/tagsets/xip-en-entities.xml
   src/main/resources/com/xerox/xrce/europeana/tagsets/xip-en.xml

The .properties file is the web service's entry point to the
grammar. It tells it where to find the grammar's .grm file and tagset
descriptors. A tagset descriptor lists the tags used by the grammar
for syntactic categories or named entity types.
