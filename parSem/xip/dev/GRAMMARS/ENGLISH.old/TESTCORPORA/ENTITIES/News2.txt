About Bessie Smith: Bessie Smith was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After becoming an orphan at a young age, Smith began singing on the street when she was nine. In 1912, she was hired by a touring vaudeville show to work as a dancer. Blues singer Ma Rainey was a singer in the show, and trained and guided Smith.

After returning from tour, Smith became the leading singer at the 81 Theater in Atlanta Georgia, which was part of the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA). She also began touring on the TOBA circuit.

Smith's talent was recognized when in 1923 she recorded her first record, "Down Hearted Blues". It was a huge success, selling 780,000 copies. Smith continued to record throughout the 1920s with such musicians as Fletcher Henderson, Louis Armstrong, Joe Smith, and Benny Goodman. Along with regular recordings, Smith also continued to perform on the road. In 1929, she received a part in the film St. Louis Blues.

However, the effects of the Depression on the recording industry and Smith's heavy drinking affected her career. . She began working toward making a comeback and started performing in shows and clubs again.

While Smith had become most known for her blues style, she also began to achieve success as a jazz singer. In 1935, she sang at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and later appeared in the Stars Over Broadway. However, her comeback was cut short when in 1937 she was killed in an automobile accident. At the time of her death, Smith had recorded over 200 recordings.




BRUSSELS When European leaders decided two and a half years ago to call their latest grand treaty a constitution, the idea was to sell an easy-to-understand concept, create a sense of unity and inject a dose of pan-European pride into the otherwise yawn-inspiring process of Continental integration.
.
And while that strategy has given comfort to some citizens in France and Germany, it has backfired among others, especially in Britain, and risks scuttling the whole project. The term constitution has proved far more loaded and emotional than anyone might have guessed when it was born at a leaders' meeting in Laeken, Belgium, in December 2001.
.
"The word constitution has very special and heavy connotations in some countries," said Peter Ludlow, chairman of EuroComment, a Brussels research organization. "It's very important that politicians don't play it up to be more than it is."
.
After agreeing to a final version of the text here late Friday, the European Union's 25 leaders face a long, uphill struggle to ratify the document at home. Conspicuously, many are back-peddling on the initial language and are beginning to call it a constitutional treaty rather than a constitution.
.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain hinted Sunday that his country's referendum on the question might not be held until 2006.
.
"There's no need to rush it," he said.
.
The union has a history of failed referendums on EU-related issues, notably in Denmark and Ireland, and a single "no" vote means the constitution will not come into force.
.
In addition to Britain, Denmark and Ireland, which have confirmed plans for referendums, half a dozen others including Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain appear likely to hold one.
.
In a sign of how bitter and divisive the referendum campaigns may turn out to be, Robert Kilroy-Silk, a former television talk-show host and current leader of the U.K. Independence Party, compared Blair to Neville Chamberlain, the prewar British leader who famously claimed in 1938 to have secured "peace in our time" with Nazi Germany.
.
"It's appeasement," Kilroy-Silk said Sunday. "There's Tony, he's waving a piece of paper, saying, 'It's O.K., I've only given a little bit away of our sovereignty.'
.
"In fact," he said, "this is the beginning of the end of Britain as a nation state governing itself."
.
Given that, largely on Britain's insistence, the constitutional compromise reached Friday retains vetoes in all sensitive areas from taxation to foreign policy, how have perceptions come to differ so starkly from the reality? Pro-European governments have mainly themselves to blame, analysts say. As with so many aspects of European policy, politicians have largely failed to explain to voters the constitution's substance. While easily available on the Internet, the draft text is relatively hard to come by on paper. That vacuum has been skillfully exploited by anti-European parties; their success in the European elections eight days ago made plain that people can get excited about Europe if they are engaged.
.
Blair said Sunday that the referendum was going to present "a fascinating political battle." So far, it has been a losing battle. A poll published in The Sunday Express newspaper said 57 percent of respondents said they would vote no to the constitution; 28 percent said they would vote yes; and 14 percent were undecided. The poll was conducted Friday and Saturday, with 580 voters taking part and a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.
.
Beyond the politics of the constitution, there is also a debate among lawyers and officials whether the document is really a constitution or whether it is technically a treaty. Lawyers for the European Council, which groups EU governments, successfully advised leaders earlier this month that the constitution begin with a list of the heads of state in the traditional format of a treaty between governments.
.
The document does read like a citizens' charter in some sections, with declarations about citizens' rights and a list of freedoms. "Equality between men and women must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and pay," the constitution says. Everyone has the right to health care and workers have the right to strike, the document says under the heading of solidarity.
.
But legally speaking, many of the rights listed in the constitution are nothing more than suggestions and cannot be enforced in national courts because those areas of law remain the prerogative of countries, not the union itself.
.
This mitigates the notion of a "a constitution for European citizens," the words that leaders used when they commissioned the writing of the document in December 2001.
.
The document approved Friday, which would replace the European Union's complex web of treaties, creates the posts of European Union president and foreign minister and establishes a voting system weighted for population. Leaders cocooned in Brussels for the negotiations were ebullient after reaching a deal. The Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, who was chairman of the talks, called the constitution "a great achievement for Europe" and "a great achievement for all Europeans." President Jacques Chirac of France said the constitution would allow Europe to be more efficient in making decisions and "clearly make its voice heard in the world."
.
Leaders failed, however, to pick a successor to Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, the EU's executive board. Ahern said Friday he would continue discussions with leaders but wanted to find consensus on a candidate before July.

With all that Ethel Waters has contributed to music and film, it is surprising that she is often forgotten. She was a talented blues singer whose unique style distinguished her from other blues singers and she was a jazz vocalist as well. Her talent extended beyond singing, when she became a dramatic actress who earned award nominations for her performances. What was most remarkable about Waters' performances was how she reconstructed the mammy character into one that challenged stereotypes.

Career as a Singer

Ethel Waters was born in Chester, Pennsylvania on October 31, 1896. She had a hard life in which she faced rejection from her mother and poverty. Waters' love of singing began as a child when she sang in church choirs but her childhood was cut short when at thirteen she married an abusive man, dropped out of sixth grade, and was divorced a year later. Shortly thereafter, she began working as a maid until two vaudeville producers discovered her while she was singing in a talent contest in 1917. She toured with vaudeville shows, and was billed as "Sweet Mama Stringbean" because of her height and thinness. In 1919, she left the vaudeville circuit and performed in Harlem nightclubs. Two years later she became one of the first black singers to cut a record on the Black Swan Record label with her release of "Down Home Blues" and "Oh, Daddy".

The record was a success and Waters went on tour and received great acclaim.  She toured with Fletcher Henderson and the Black Swan Jazz Masters.  The Chicago Defender and other newspapers gave the tour substantial notoriety.  The tour increased Black Swan's revenues, and made Waters a top performer who became known for her shimmies and soft style of singing. 

Waters' success was related to her style of singing. She could sing like other classic blues singers with plenty of passion and fire, but she had a unique approach. She was not a shouter but was able to hold the attention of the audience with her low and sweet voice.  According to Jimmy McPartland, who saw her in the 1927 show Miss Calico,"We were enthralled with her.  We liked Bessie Smith very much, too, but Waters had more polish, I guess you' say.  She phrased so wonderfully, the natural quality of her voice was so fine . . ."(1) Waters introduced a new style of the blues, one that was influenced by her grandmother who always told her "You don't have to holler so. God has very big ears. He can hear you even if you whisper."(2)  Just the opposite, her mother's preference was more in line with the Holy Rollers and the Baptists style. Waters' style was a combination of both these approaches. The result was one that was characterized by sophistication, refinement, moderation, only rare growls, and precise enunciation.

Waters' unique style contributed her ability to sing various styles of music. Like other classic blues singers, she could sing torches, pop songs from Tin Pan Alley, vaudeville, and musical theatre tunes. Her style encompassed the use of wide vocal ranges and upbeat rhythmic renditions that were similar to vaudeville singing. According to Clyde Bernhardt, a jazz musician who saw her perform in 1921 at the Chestnut Auditorium in Pennsylvania, she could do the blues, a fast-tempo jazz song, and a ballad and make it sound beautiful.

Because of her varied repertoire, she has also been categorized as a jazz singer. Her rhythm was closer to jazz than blues and in her later career she sang popular songs with a jazz approach. Jazz critic, Hugues Panassie wrote that Waters was a great jazz singer. He praises her clear voice, her extensive range, the ease in which she sings, and the perfect tone of every note. He also claims that her influence on female jazz singers is "almost as great as that of Louis Armstrong."(3) She influenced such great singers as Billie Holiday who took songs from her repertoire and recorded them as "Billie's Blues" and Sophie Tucker who paid Waters to sing for her privately so that she could study her style.  Other admirers included Mildred Bailey, Ella Fitzgerald, the Boswell Sisters, and Eartha Kitt.

Waters' talent extended beyond musical style, she also had the gift of interpretation.  She set a new standard with her rendition of "Stormy Weather"at the Cotton Club in 1933.  Waters changed the original interpretation of the ending and gave it a dramatic conclusion.  Her performance was unforgettable and was the talk of New York.   Her interpretive talent would not go to waste.  As blues women began to fade in popularity, Waters was able use her interpretive ability to take advantage of acting opportunities on stage and screen.




Intelligent, dedicated, charismatic, and religious, Martin Luther King, Jr. had what it took to inspire the conscience of the American public. He appealed to the moral sense of Americans, and after years of leading blacks in nonviolent protest and direct action, his leadership helped to desegregate the South.

Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia to Alberta Williams King and Martin Luther King, Sr., a minister. At a young age King excelled in school and went on to skip ninth and twelfth grade. When he was fifteen he enrolled at Morehouse College. He graduated in 1948 with a bachelor in Sociology. That same year he began attending Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. Among his studies, he took a particular interest in Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy.


In 1954, King became the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Shortly thereafter, on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested after she refused to give up her seat to a white patron on a Montgomery city bus. Based on Parks decision to contest the arrest, the Montgomery Improvement Association was founded in order organize the boycott of the city buses. The members of the association elected King as president.

During the boycott, King received numerous threats and his home bombed. King and his family were not harmed. After more than a year, the boycott ended when the United States Supreme Court affirmed the District Court order to desegregate the city buses.

After successfully navigating the Montgomery bus boycott, King and other ministers founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which served to organize civil rights events throughout the South.

In 1959, King furthered his knowledge of Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy when he visited India. Upon his return, King moved to Atlanta, Georgia to co-pastor with his father at Ebenezer Baptist Church. While a co-pastor, King also stayed involved with the SCLC. In October 1960, King participated in the student sit-in movement. King was arrested and sentenced to serve time in prison. His sentence received nationwide media attention. After President Dwight Eisenhower decided not to intervene, presidential candidate John F. Kennedy got involved, and King was released.

King continued to participate in nonviolent protest. King, A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and other civil rights leaders organized  It took place on August 28, 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial. At the march, King gave his famous "I have a dream" speech. More than 250,000 blacks and whites gathered while the speech was televised.

In 1963, King became Time magazine's Man of the Year and he received the Noble Peace Prize in 1964. This was also an important year for the civil rights movement. As the movement had garnered widespread support, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.

After 1965, disenfranchisement with King surfaced among blacks that became impatient with his method of nonviolent resistance. During the Selma, Alabama march for voting rights, opposition became more prevalent when the marchers, led by King, marched across the Pettus Bridge but stopped when confronted by a barricade of state troopers. King and the marchers kneeled, prayed, and then turned around. Radical blacks believed that King should have handled the situation differently. Furthermore, as the black power movement became stronger and as Malcolm X's message of Black Nationalism became more accepted by Northern urban blacks, King increasingly became a controversial figure.

Despite the growing dissatisfaction with King's tactics, he expanded his focus to include opposition to the Vietnam War. However, King's disagreement with the war led to strained relations with the Lyndon Johnson administration.

King also began focusing on the poor of all races. In the spring of 1968, in the midst of planning the Poor People's March on Washington, King left for Memphis, Tennessee to lead a strike of city sanitation workers. It was there that he delivered his last speech, "I've been to the mountaintop." The next day, on April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel, he was shot. He was 39 years old. A few months later, on June 8, 1968, James Earl Ray was arrested in London, England. Ray pled guilty and was sentenced to ninety-nine years in prison. 




 VLADIKAVKAZVLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AFP) Armed clashes erupted near Russia's separatist republic of Chechnya overnight as rebels stormed police targets in neighboring Ingushetia in brazen attacks that killed almost 50 people and wounded dozens, officials said.

Ingushetia's interior minister, Abukar Kostoyev, was among those killed, the Interfax news agency reported. The incursion was the most spectacular military operation by Chechen rebels outside the war-torn republic in years.

Forty-eight people, both civilians and policemen, were killed in the fighting, Interfax quoted an official with the local police as saying.

"Among the casualties are 18 policemen and 28 civilians," the Ingush interior ministry's top spokesman Yakhya Khadziyev said. He added that another 30 people had been wounded in the fighting.

The bodies of two dead rebels had been discovered and were being identified, the official said.

An unidentified official with the local police earlier said some 30 people were killed in the fighting.

Clashes between rebels and law enforcement authorities broke out in at least three towns in Ingushetia, which houses tens of thousands of refugees who fled the fighting in Chechnya and where many Chechen rebels have taken shelter.

Some 200 rebels were involved in the clashes with law enforcement authorities, Interfax quoted an official with the Ingush interior ministry as saying.

The fighters targeted police stations, government buildings and checkpoints in the towns of Nazran, Karabulak and Sleptsovsk during the raid, which witnesses told AFP began around 10:00 pm (1800 GMT) Monday.

"They tried to take over the interior ministry and several of the regional police stations," Umar Sapraviyev, an official with Ingushetia's representation in Moscow, told Moscow Echo radio.

Many of the rebels, who apparently moved onto their targets from Chechnya and the neighboring republic of North Ossetia, shouted "Allah-u-Akbar" (God is greatest), Ingushetiya.ru news site reported, quoting witnesses.

Terrified residents spent the night cowering in their homes to sounds of automatic gunfire, mortars, grenade launchers, and helicopters flying overhead, witnesses told AFP.

"Many people are panicked and want to leave as soon as morning comes," one Nazran resident told AFP by telephone during the night. "Some say they may even go back to Chechnya."

At one of the police stations, the Nazran ROVD, 30 officers were killed, Ingushetiya.ru reported, quoting an unnamed police officer.

Witnesses reported seeing a military vehicle column come under gunfire a few minutes after entering Ingushetia from the neighboring republic of North Ossetia.

Many of the wounded were taken to Ingushetia's main hospital.

"Among them are civilians and representatives of law enforcement agencies... there are those who are severely injured," Interfax quoted an unnamed hospital official as saying.

The battles had died down by early Tuesday as the rebels withdrew, though sporadic fighting continued, news reports said.

The fighters did take control of at least one of the police checkpoints that are ubiquitous in Ingushetia, RIA-Novosti reported, quoting a camera crew with NTV television that was stopped at the post by masked armed men.

"They pointed guns at us and ordered us to get out of the car," the news agency quoted an NTV reporter as saying.

"They said they were rebels," the reporter said, apparently referring to Chechen separatists, who have been fighting pro-Moscow forces in the region since the start of the current Russo-Chechen war in October 1999.

The crew saw several bodies in military uniforms lying near the checkpoint. "It looked like they were manning the checkpoint and were shot by the rebels," he said.

Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov announced a three-day mourning period beginning on Wednesday, Interfax reported.

"This was aimed at destabilizing the situation" in the region, Zyazikov said.

Chechnya's pro-Moscow interior minister blamed feared Chechen rebel commander Shamil Basayev for the attacks and vowed a tough response.

"We have information that Basayev may have planned this operation and his men carried it out," Ali Alkhanov said. "We will take all measures to defeat them."

Russia poured tens of thousands of troops into Chechnya in October 1999 in what was supposed to be a lightning-strike anti-terror operation.

The Kremlin insists that the war has effectively ended and the situation in the ravaged republic has normalized. But a guerrilla war that claims lives on nearly a daily basis belies such claims.

	 
   QINGDAO, China (AFP) Twenty-two Asian foreign ministers met in China with the need for a regional energy policy high on their agenda because of soaring global oil prices.

They were to end their talks later in the day by issuing a so-called Qingdao Initiative -- named after the eastern port city where the gathering took place -- outlining strategies for supplying the energy-hungry region.

"Enhanced energy cooperation is necessary to safeguard Asian energy security and promote economic development in our countries," Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said at the opening of the meeting.

"Therefore, the Chinese government is actively pushing for the publication of the Qingdao Initiative," he said.

The Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), created two years ago on a Thai initiative, was being held outside Thailand for the first time, with the region's second-largest economy offering itself as an eager host.

With a roaring economy expanding nearly 10 percent in the first quarter, China has pushed up prices on key commodities in recent months and is now the world's second-largest importer of oil.

Despite China's voracious appetite, Wen sought to reassure that his country would have no crushing impact on the energy market.

"Since China has a large population and its economy has sustained rapid growth, its energy production and consumption have kept increasing," he said.

"We will mainly rely on the development of domestic resources and step up the development and utilization of coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear energy and various types of new energy," he said.

The Qingdao Initiative, addressing concerns like these, would mark an "important step forward" in energy security in the region, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri said.

According to the state-run China Daily newspaper, the ACD is proposing an energy forum to regularly discuss key aspects, such as developing better energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and infrastructure networks.

Han Wenke, an energy researcher at China's National Development and Reform Commission, told the paper such a forum was sorely needed.

"Although many projects are still in their conceptual stages, Asian countries have more and more recognized the urgency for establishing an organizational structure for cooperation in the power sector," Han said.

Long Yongtu, a former Chinese deputy foreign trade minister, said the rest of the world would not have to fear the emergence of a closed "Fortress Asia" in the energy markets.

"Regional cooperation in Asia is a cooperation open to the world," he told reporters. "We can't create a kind of regional group that is closed to the outside world."

Given growing Chinese clout, much of the conference has been spent soothing regional fears about what a strong China would mean for them.

"China will never seek hegemony," Wen said. "We will continue to value and support the Asia Cooperation Dialogue."

On Monday, on the sidelines of the ACD meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing met his colleagues from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is becoming increasingly jittery at the rise of their giant neighbor to the north.

"The Chinese side reaffirmed its support for ASEAN's role as the major driving force in East Asia cooperation," the ministers said in a release after their talks.

The lofty goal of the ACD is to "ultimately transform the Asian continent into an Asian community, capable of interacting with the rest of the world on a more equal footing", according to the Thai foreign ministry.






IHT, Mon June, 21.

 in Memphis, Tennessee, to the Church of God in Christ demonstrated, former President Bill Clinton is capable of soaring eloquence and visionary thinking. But as those who heard his deadening speech nominating Michael Dukakis at the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta well know, he is also capable of numbing, self-conscious garrulity.
.
Unfortunately for the reader, Clinton's much-awaited new autobiography "My Life" more closely resembles the Atlanta speech, which was so long-winded and tedious that the crowd cheered when he finally reached the words "In closing ..."
.
The book, which weighs in at more than 950 pages, is sloppy, self-indulgent and often eye-crossingly dull - the sound of one man prattling away, not for the reader, but for himself and some distant recording angel of history. In many ways, the book is a mirror of Clinton's presidency: lack of discipline leading to squandered opportunities; high expectations, undermined by self-indulgence and scattered concentration.
.
This memoir, published by Alfred A. Knopf, underscores many strengths of Clinton's eight years in the White House and his understanding that he was governing during a transitional and highly polarized period. But the very lack of focus and order that mars these pages also prevented him from summoning his energies in a sustained manner to bring his insights about the growing terror threat and an Israeli-Palestinian settlement to fruition.
.
Certainly it is easy enough to understand the huge advance sales for the book. Clinton would seem to have all the gifts for writing a gripping memoir: gifts of language, erudition and charm, combined with a policy wonk's perception of a complex world at a hinge moment in time, teetering on the pivot between cold war assumptions and a new era of global interdependence. Add to that, his improbable life story - a harrowing roller-coaster ride of precocious achievements, self-inflicted slip-ups and even more startling comebacks - and you have all the ingredients for a compelling book.
.
But while the CBS anchor Dan Rather, who interviewed Clinton for "60 Minutes," already compared the book to the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, arguably the most richly satisfying autobiography by an American president, "My Life" has little of that classic's unsparing candor or historical perspective. Instead, it devolves into a hodgepodge of jottings: part policy primer, part 12-step confessional, part stump speech and part presidential archive, all, it seems, hurriedly written and even more hurriedly edited.
.
There are endless litanies of meals eaten, speeches delivered, voters greeted and turkeys pardoned for Thanksgiving. There are some fascinating sections about Clinton's efforts to negotiate a Middle East peace agreement (at one point, he suggests that Yasser Arafat seemed confused, not fully in command of the facts and possibly no longer at the top of his game), but there are also tedious descriptions of long-ago political debates in Arkansas over utility regulation and car license fees. There are some revealing complaints about missteps at the FBI under Louis Freeh's watch, but there are also dozens of pointless digressions about matters like zombies in Haiti and ruins in Pompeii.
.
Clinton confesses that his affair with Monica Lewinsky was "immoral and foolish," but he spends far more space excoriating his nemesis, the independent counsel Kenneth Starr, and the press.
.
Part of the problem, of course, is that Clinton is concerned, here, with cementing - or establishing - his legacy, while at the same time boosting (or at least not undermining) the political career of his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. He does a persuasive job of explicating his more successful initiatives like welfare reform and deficit reduction, but the failure of his health care initiative, overseen by Hillary Clinton, is quickly glossed over, as is the subsequent focus of his administration on such small-bore initiatives as school uniforms and teenage smoking.
.
Clinton takes more responsibility in these pages for his affair with Lewinsky, his lies about that affair and the damage those actions inflicted on his family and his presidency than he has in the past. But he still spends a lot of time - like his wife did in her book - assailing rightist enemies for his woes over Whitewater, the Paula Jones case and impeachment. In the end, he says, what brought him and his wife back together was weekly counseling sessions and their shared determination "to fight off the right-wing coup."
.
In one passage, Clinton tries to characterize his impeachment fight as "my last great showdown with the forces I had opposed all of my life" - with those who had defended segregation in the South, opposed the women's and gay rights movements, and who believed government should be run for the benefit of special interests. He adds that he is glad he had "the good fortune to stand against this latest incarnation of the forces of reaction and division."
.
In comparison to these self-serving, often turgid attempts to defend his reputation, Clinton's account of his youth in Arkansas possesses a pleasing emotional directness.
.
His portraits of life in the raffish Hot Springs and the more sedate Hope (Arkansas towns that would became the polestars of his Janus-faced personality, what political guru Dick Morris once called "Saturday Night Bill" and "Sunday Morning Clinton") may lack the raw energy of his mother Virginia Kelley's reminiscences, set down in her 1994 book "Leading With My Heart," but he does provide the reader with some telling snapshots of his awkward childhood: a fat, self-conscious boy dressed in a new Easter outfit every year - including, one year, pink and black Hush Puppies and a matching pink suede belt; breaking his leg trying to jump rope wearing cowboy boots; devouring books about Geronimo and Crazy Horse at the local library.
.
Looking back on those days of living with a violent, abusive stepfather, Clinton writes like someone familiar with therapeutic tropes. He writes that seeing his stepfather angry and drunk, he came to associate anger with being out of control, and determined to keep his own anger locked away. He writes about experiencing a "major spiritual crisis" at the age of 13, when he found it difficult to sustain a belief in God in the face of his family's difficulties.
.
For the most part, the self-portrait that emerges from this book is not all that different a Bill Clinton from the one the public has already come to know: tireless, driven, boyish, self-absorbed and optimistic, someone riven by contradictions but adept at compartmentalizing different parts of his life.America's first baby-boomer president always seemed like an avatar of his generation, defined by the struggles of the '60s and Vietnam, comfortable in the use of touchy-feely language, and intent on demystifying his job. And yet the former president's 957-page account of his life, read in this post-9/11 day, feels strangely like an artifact from a distant, more innocent era.

IHT,june,20.
 
BRUSSELS The NATO summit meeting in Istanbul at the end of June will cap a month of high level international meetings that began with the D-Day commemorations. Iraq has been on the agenda of all of these, as it will be in Istanbul.
.
Our NATO summit meeting takes place only days before the Iraqi interim government assumes authority and responsibility for Iraq's future. It will be for that government to decide to what extent and in what form Iraq might call upon the international community, including NATO, for assistance.
.
Currently NATO is supporting the Polish-led division in Iraq, and many North Atlantic allies have troops on the ground in a national capacity. UN Security Council Resolution 1546 reflects the international community's resolve to support the interim government. It makes sense for NATO to discuss whether the allies could play a further role if asked to do so.
.
I do not wish to prejudge the outcome of such a discussion at the Istanbul summit meeting. However it is clear to me that the entire international community has a profound interest in ensuring that the new Iraq finds it feet. The price of failure is simply too high.
.
The same applies to the other key challenge we will also discuss in Istanbul, an issue which has been my first priority since taking office in January - helping to build a new future for Afghanistan. As in Iraq, we cannot afford to let Afghanistan fail.
.
NATO is already playing its part, mainly by helping to keep the peace in the capital. At Istanbul, I am confident that the heads of state and government, alongside President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, will confirm that NATO will expand its peacekeeping mission beyond Kabul by bringing more provincial reconstruction teams under NATO command. In doing so, they will illustrate NATO's effectiveness at building security where it is needed today - just as the alliance is doing in the Balkans and in the Mediterranean.
.
Afghanistan is not only an immediate challenge. It is also an example of the new kinds of operations this alliance must be prepared to face - largely unforeseen, far from our traditional areas of operation, and a test of our collective ability to contribute to peace when and where we must.
.
That is why in Istanbul I intend to put some fresh thoughts before the NATO leaders on matching our grasp with our reach. Should NATO own and operate certain key assets, beyond AWACS? Can we take a longer horizon for our force planning, which includes better preparation for new operations? What new steps can we take to make sure that our political commitments are matched by resources?
.
We must prepare the alliance for the future. Our heads of state and government will put into action a plan for NATO to acquire cutting-edge technologies to defend against terrorism. They will deepen NATO's partnerships with the strategically important regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. And they will endorse a change in our relations with the six Arab nations and Israel in our Mediterranean Dialogue toward substantive, practical partnership.
.
In Istanbul, I am confident that we will also open up, for the first time, a security dialogue with the broader region of the Middle East. This dialogue must be, and will be, a two-way street. Such a bridge of open consultation will only be strong if it is built and maintained by all the participants together. And if it succeeds over time in breaking down stereotypes and fostering trust, our Istanbul Cooperation Initiative has the potential to make a real contribution to enhancing our common security.
.
Istanbul marks another major step forward for the Atlantic alliance. It will confirm NATO's role as an indispensable peacekeeper in new theaters. It will enhance our ability to shape change and build peace through dialogue and cooperation. Istanbul will continue the modernization of NATO's capability to take on the most demanding missions of the 21st century.
.
While NATO's transformation continues, its fundamental purpose endures as a vital instrument for Europe and North America to defend peace, democracy and stability in, and increasingly beyond, the Euro-Atlantic area, now and into the future.
.
Jaap de Hoop Scheffer is secretary general of NATO.




IHT, JUNE,20.


TOKYO A powerful storm lashed western Japan with heavy rains and strong winds on Monday, grounding airplanes and forcing hundreds to evacuate their homes after leaving three people dead over the weekend.
.
The three drowned as the typhoon approached Japan's main islands, and two other people were missing. Seven people were injured Monday, according to the National Police Agency.
.
Early Monday, the Meteorological Agency classified the storm, called Dianmu, or "Mother of Lightning" in Mandarin Chinese, as "large and very powerful" and warned that it could dump up to 400 millimeters, or 16 inches, of rain on Osaka and the surrounding area over the next day.
.
But Dianmu gradually lost power and became a tropical storm, packing sustained winds of 108 kilometers, or 67 miles, per hour as it traveled northeast, the agency said.
.
At midday Monday, the storm was centered near Akashi, about 435 kilometers west of Tokyo.
.
Typhoons generally hit Japan during August and September, and it is rare for them to make their way across the archipelago in June. The public broadcaster, NHK, said that more than 100 flights had been canceled throughout western Japan and that ferry service across the region had been suspended. About 720 people had to evacuate their homes, while nearly 27,000 households lost electric power in western Japan. The National Police Agency said seven people were injured, mostly hit by flying objects or swept over in strong wind.In Owase, about 370 kilometers southwest of Tokyo, an innkeeper fell from a roof while fixing a television antenna and broke his wrists. A woman was hit by a flying tin roof panel and suffered a minor head injury.

On Sunday, police in Shizuoka, 150 kilometers west of Tokyo, found the bodies of two college students believed to have been swept out by rough seas during a beach barbecue on Saturday. A 32-year-old man died while sailboarding in high waves off southern Okinawa island. Authorities were looking for a Tokyo resident, Seiji Ikeda, 73, who disappeared after he went fishing south of Tokyo on Friday. They were also searching for a 19-year-old man reported missing in waters off western Wakayama.
TOKYO A powerful storm lashed western Japan with heavy rains and strong winds on Monday, grounding airplanes and forcing hundreds to evacuate their homes after leaving three people dead over the weekend.

    The launching of Apollo 11 on July 16, 1969, was the most significant event during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. This scientific breakthrough was the greatest accomplishment of the century, assuring the American people that the US was superior in their technology as well as their defense weapons. Until Apollo 11, America was losing "the Space Race" to the Soviet Union.

    On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first satellite into space. A month later the Soviets launched Sputnik II containing the first living creature, a dog named Laika, thus pushing the Russians to a commanding lead in the beginning of an international space exploration battle.

    The United States began to panic. The Gallup polls found that half of all Americans believed the Soviets held the lead "in the development of missiles and long-distance rockets (Bates)." By early 1958, more than a third of Americans thought that the Soviets "could wipe out most cities in the United States in a matter of a few hours with their new rockets and missiles" (Bates). One out of three Americans also expected the outbreak of World War III by the early 1960's. President Eisenhower remained calm throughout the whole panic although he faced attacks on the US's military system and the "deficient" education system. Life magazine devoted five issues to the "Crisis in Education," arguing in one article that the spartan Soviet system was producing students better equipped to cope with the Space Age. Books such as "Why Johnny Can't Read", explaining Americans' ineptness in education, reached the top of the bestseller list.

    Ten years later, the Americans launched their first manned mission to the moon in Apollo 11. Apollo's crew consisted of Commander Neil Armstrong, pilot Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin Jr., and pilot Michael Collins. The space craft consisted of a lunar module, called the "Eagle", and the command module and service module, which linked together to form "Columbia" (the command service module). Two hours and thirty-three minutes after takeoff, the spacecraft broke free from earth's orbit and began circling the moon. Each orbit of the moon took two hours. The lunar module and the command service module separated, sending the two astronauts in the LM to the lunar surface at the Sea of Tranquility, leaving the third pilot in lunar orbit in the command module. The Eagle landed on the moon 102 hours, 45 minutes, and 4 seconds after launching from earth; on July 20th. Armstrong emerged from the spacecraft first and released a surface television to record mankind's first steps on the moon. A plaque affixed to the leg of the lunar landing vehicle, signed by President Nixon and the three crew members, read "HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON JULY 1969 AD WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND." Scientific studies were performed, and soil and rock samples were acquired by the astronauts during this first "moonwalk." After roughly two and a quarter hours, the men returned to the lunar module and returned to earth, splashing into the Pacific Ocean on July 24th.

    With this eight-day lunar trip, the Americans triumphed over the Soviet Union in the space race by walking on the moon. This event proved to be one of the biggest steps in America's efforts to rebuild confidence in the US's scientific and militaristic abilities.






IHT, June,20.

LONDON The guitar strains of Buddy Holly's "It's So Easy to Fall in Love" jangled through a London auditorium last week as Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer, introduced the company's iTunes online music service to Europe.
.
The recording industry, which resisted selling music via the Internet until it got jilted by consumers, now embraces iTunes and a bevy of other legitimate services. It sees them as the best hope for fighting file-sharing, which provides no-cost access to millions of recordings at the click of a mouse.
.
Swirling around the new competition in digital music are questions about who owns what, when and where on the Internet, and how - or even whether - they should pay for it.
.
How the music business resolves such questions is likely to set the pattern for the distribution of movies and other media, analysts say, as high-speed Internet access spreads and mobile phones provide continuous access.
.
"Music was the first entertainment industry to go into that dark file-sharing tunnel, so we've taken all the early bruises," said Dan Whiley, business development director at Universal Music eLabs. "Maybe we're first out of the tunnel, and maybe our solutions will set some precedents for other industries which depend on copyright and intellectual property."
.
The competition among online music services pits the titans of the technology world against each other, including Jobs at Apple and Bill Gates at Microsoft, but ordinary Web surfers probably hold the keys. Getting them to fall in love with these new offerings may prove anything but easy.
.
Consider people like Afua, a 22-year-old Londoner who uses Internet file-sharing services to discover new music. She said she had heard about the legitimate online sites but was skeptical about their appeal.
.
"Why would I pay for something I can get for free?" she said, adding that her 18-year-old sister and her friends, being short on cash, are even more avid users of file-sharing networks.
.
"The younger generation is incredibly computer-literate," she said.
.
The fact that young people today see a four-year age gap as an entire generation says a lot about the pace of technological change in the digital era.
.
In roughly that amount of time, the music industry went from its highest-ever sales to one of its worst slumps as it tried to protect the CD instead of embracing the Internet. Global sales of recorded music fell to $32 billion in 2003 from $40 billion in 1999, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries, as buyers defected first to sites like Napster, then to peer-to-peer services such as Kazaa.
.
"Young people have grown up expecting online music to be free," said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Jupiter Research in London. "That isn't going to change overnight. But European consumers finally have a choice of compelling, competing services."
.
Apple's introduction of iTunes in Britain, France and Germany last week, more than a year after it opened for business in the United States, was the highest-profile event yet for the nascent European market in legitimate online music services.
.
It was preceded in Britain by the start of a legal version of the once-notorious Napster in May. Napster has said it will expand to the Continent later this year. Meanwhile, Sony plans to start its Connect service in Britain, France and Germany this month.
.
A British company called On Demand Distribution, or OD2, which was co-founded by the singer Peter Gabriel in 1999, was the pioneer among European online services. While it has no consumer presence of its own, it is the backbone for a number of online music sites fronted by better-known brands like Coca-Cola and Microsoft's MSN.
.
With bigger American rivals entering its turf, OD2 has been looking for a financial backer. People close to the company say a partnership, or even an outright sale, could be announced as soon as Monday.
.
Another company that is expected to enter the European online music market this year is RealNetworks, which operates the Rhapsody service in the United States and provides audio- and video-playing software. Matthew Graves, a spokesman, said, "As an international company, we're always looking for opportunities."
.
The music industry federation estimates that there are now more than 50 online music retailers operating in Europe, out of a total of more than 100 worldwide, though most of those in Europe are powered by OD2.
.
But competition and choice bring new complications. Analysts say the rivals could turn off consumers with an array of incompatible technologies and sometimes incomplete product offerings.
.
Jobs, for instance, has rebuffed overtures to make iTunes compatible with competing audio formats, as Apple seeks to drive sales of its sleek iPod portable music player. The marketing appeal of the iPod has helped iTunes grab an early lead in the U.S. market, and it claims about 70 percent of the market for legal downloads.
.
But in Europe, as in the United States, Apple enters a market where Microsoft has a strong position. Its Windows Media 9 software is used by OD2, Napster and other services and is compatible with more than 70 portable music players now on the market - though not the iPod.
.
MSN offers a retail music site in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, using OD2's "digital jukebox" offering; it is expanding into Belgium and Spain this summer. Although MSN is building on its own site in the United States, it has no plans to do so at the moment in Europe, said Geoff Sutton, the MSN general manager in Europe.
.
"They have the rights, and that's obviously attractive," he said of OD2.
.
Microsoft this year lost an antitrust case in the European Union over the inclusion of its Media Player jukebox software in Windows to the detriment of rivals like RealNetworks and Apple. The company is appealing the decision.
.
Analysts say that if the rivals choose to battle it out over formats and technology - rather than solve their differences by cross-licensing - they risk losing the bigger struggle against piracy.
.
When consumers download illegally from the Internet, they do not have to choose among competing formats, after all. And their actions are not controlled by "digital rights management" software, which the legitimate services employ to enable consumers to download a purchased track while limiting the number of times it can be copied onto CDs or portable devices.
.
Charles Grimsdale, chief executive of OD2, said last week at a news conference that he thought interoperability with Apple would be negotiated within "12 to 18 months."
.
Sony, meanwhile, backs its own competing technology. Though it has said it will start Connect in Europe by the end of the month, the introduction will be low-key, and Sony will delay the introduction if it means "compromising on quality," said Gregor Erkel, Sony Europe's director of online music services. He said Sony planned to tailor its offerings for the French, German and British markets, where domestically focused music can sometimes make up as much as 40 percent of sales.
.
Marketing and pricing could prove equally tricky. The lack of a pan-European system for collecting and distributing royalties to artists delayed the start of the online services, particularly to smaller Continental markets. It also has kept prices higher than in the United States, though they are falling as competition heats up and Apple arrives with an offering of 99 euro cents, or $1.20, per downloaded track.
.
But iTunes, rivals note, requires a credit card for payment, which could be a barrier to acceptance in places like Germany, where relatively few people use them. Some rivals accept payment in a variety of ways, including billing to customers' mobile phone bills.
.
Mobile phones also present possibilities for distribution of music, particularly as advanced new wireless networks are brought on line across Europe. Already sales of ring tones for mobile phones, which chime away to the melodies of hit songs, are a significant business.
.
Mobile downloading of actual recorded music is a business still in its infancy. But impulse buying of individual tracks might seem like the perfect market for European mobile phone users, who often seem as enamored of their handsets as they are of their favorite musicians.
.
Mobile downloads will remain relatively expensive, analysts say, as fees will have to cover not only rights paid to recording companies but also the cost of a data "call" - which with current GPRS, or general packet radio service, networks can take four minutes or more.
.
That would be one obvious example of the digital "convergence" that technology soothsayers have promised for years. But it could be only a start, if the digital music ventures now under way serve as a model for other media.
.
Sony, for instance, is looking at a variety of video and mobile services that could be used in conjunction with Connect, Erkel said. "This is only the nucleus," he said.

The invasion of Panama in 1989 was known as Operation JUST CAUSE. Its key objectives were the capture of Manuel Noriega and the establishment of a democratic government. Noriega was the Panamanian leader who US officials had indicted on drug trafficking charges.1 With the transfer of the Canal Zone from US to Panama approaching, the US government wanted to make sure Panama was in the hands of people they could control. Many believe that Noriega's illegal operations were known long before, but it had not been in the interest of the US to get rid of him. However, when he suddenly withdrew his support, the US pressed charges.2    

     First, a military coup was tried but failed. On December 20, 1989, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, an aerial bombardment burst upon Panama's sleeping cities. In this surprise and forceful attack, the US military hit 27 targets in densely populated areas. Thousands of Panamanians, especially those in poor slum areas, were killed, injured, or lost their homes. This was unlike a typical military action where civilian areas were avoided.  At the time, it was the largest US military action since the Viet Nam War.

    Media coverage of the invasion was marked by significant misrepresentation.  Destruction caused by the military was underreported.   The US media tended to interview upper middle class, English-speaking Panamanian whose lives had not been disrupted and destroyed by the attack and siege of the country.3  According to them, the operation was a success and of great benefit to Panama.  The US government was happy that the rich white elite was back in control.  It has been overthrown by Omar Torrijo, Noriega's predecessor. This small group of people was much more ready to cooperate with the US officials in their best interests.

    Upon his capture, Manuel Noriega was sentenced to 40 years in a US federal prison for drug racketeering, money laundering and drug trafficing.



 
ROME In the days and weeks leading to the Italian Parliament's August recess, a battle raged in Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's governing coalition that posed the greatest threat yet to his hold on power.
.
The near-collapse suggested that Berlusconi's three years in office, the very accomplishment he boasts of most, had dulled his luster and worn thin his onetime invulnerability.
.
Coalition partners hungry for more clout after relatively strong showings in June's local elections were also fed up with years of undelivered promises. Italians tired of economic slumps and his international gaffes wanted to see some change.
.
Yet many analysts say that Berlusconi's present stint, the longest in Italy's postwar era, represents in itself the greatest change and contribution to a country marred by ceaseless government turnover. The prime minister's uncanny survival instincts and political acumen have granted Italy a taste of relative stability.
.
"Stability is an important value," said Roberto D'Alimonte, a professor of political science at the University of Florence. "And there is some virtue to the chance of voting on an incumbent prime minister. It increases accountability."
.
But critics refused to give high grades for attendance alone. They cast Berlusconi as a disappointing student, too often distracted from his homework by poorly behaving friends and a host of extracurricular activities. He even had to resort to last-minute cramming to squeak through to summer recess.
.
Berlusconi indeed seemed anxious to get to summer break. After skillfully quashing lingering gripes in his coalition and using risky confidence votes to push through pension and budget reforms, he told reporters, "Now I can go on vacation in peace."
.
Confidence votes ensure discipline from disgruntled coalition partners because a loss forces the collapse of the government. So many political analysts saw those successful efforts to rush legislation onto the books as a sign of Berlusconi's desperation.
.
"Berlusconi was running out of time; he had to deliver," D'Alimonte said. "Confidence votes are a shortcut." The Italian opposition argues that Berlusconi, who is a media mogul and the country's richest man, wasted too much of his first years in power dwelling on his own personal interests rather than tackling difficult social reforms.
.
They claim that Berlusconi passed a dearth of important legislation until last month's flurry of activity and charge that he was too preoccupied with enacting laws to help him slip out of legal troubles or expand his business empire.
.
"We spent most of these three years dealing with tailor-made bills," said Paolo Gentiloni, a center-left member of Parliament. "The result is that his business is in really good shape, but the country is not."
.
Berlusconi's supporters contend that those laws benefit all. They point out that they have passed the first substantial reform to Italy's schools in ages, have pushed ahead on many enormous public works projects and reformed the country's rigid labor markets.
.
"We have a lot of results that other governments have not achieved," said Paolo Bonaiuti, Berlusconi's spokesman.
.
But a deep division in Berlusconi's coalition between those who want to help their electoral bases in the country's wealthy north or poorer south has paralyzed Berlusconi's far-reaching campaign promises.
.
"There is a gap between his political force and electoral plan," said Angelo Panebianco, a political science professor at the University of Bologna, who added that a bickering coalition was nevertheless better than a collapsed one.
.
Italy has had more than 50 governments since World War II, and tiny parties wield disproportionate amounts of power inside fractious and fragile coalitions. That leads to constant appeasement and little social reform, which many say is at the heart of the country's current economic problem.
.
There is hope that this government's stability could eventually help create something closer to a manageable two-party system.
.
Yet D'Alimonte warned: "Stability is not good per se. You have to use it to make good laws." Berlusconi's advisers said they had done just that, and cited what they call a positive influence outside Italy's borders. Berlusconi has forged close relationships with Presidents George W. Bush of the United States and Vladimir Putin of Russia, and he claims to have put Italy back on the map of geopolitical importance with his staunch support of the war in Iraq.
.
"He has been revolutionary in foreign policy, pro-U.S. in Iraq and pro -Israel. That's an interruption in a longer Italian continuity," said Giuliano Ferrara, a friend of Berlusconi's who edits Il Foglio, a conservative newspaper. "He introduced personality and a no-shame-of-money approach to politics." But Ferrara acknowledged that the prime minister's ownership of television channels, publishing houses and advertising firms created an anomalous conflict of interest that, when compounded by a series of international gaffes, exposed a less flattering aspect of that personality.
.
In three years Berlusconi has compared a German member of European Parliament to a Nazi and invited the New York Stock Exchange to invest in Italy because it had beautiful secretaries. He has disappeared from the political scene to get a face-lift, and reappeared in the pages of his wife's authorized biography as "not a man ready to confront reality."
.
While his supporters discard those examples as trivial, they admit his coalition travails have proved more serious. This summer all three of his major partners threatened to quit as the economic deficit ballooned.
.
But Berlusconi, the consummate wheeling-and-dealing mediator, found a compromise that gave his government a new lease on life.
.
Not everyone was so sure how long it would last. "What we're seeing," said Gentiloni, the Parliament member, "is the power of what we Italians call 'General August': He overcomes all political turmoil because everyone wants to go on vacation. The problems will be back and more serious in September."

Iran and North Korea continue work, despite months of diplomatic pressure
 
KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine American intelligence officials and outside nuclear experts have concluded that the Bush administration's diplomatic efforts with European and Asian allies have barely slowed the nuclear weapons programs in Iran and North Korea over the past year, and that both have made significant progress.
.
In a tacit acknowledgment that the diplomatic initiatives with European and Asian allies have failed to slow the programs, senior administration and intelligence officials say they are seeking ways to step up unspecified covert actions intended, in the words of one official, "to disrupt or delay as long as we can" Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
.
But other experts, including former Clinton administration officials, caution that while covert efforts have been tried in the past, both the Iranian and North Korean programs are increasingly self-sufficient, largely thanks to the aid they received from the network built by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the former leader of the Pakistani bomb program.
.
"It's a much harder thing to accomplish today," said one senior American intelligence official, "than it would have been in the '90s."
.
Khan's efforts have also worked against the Bush administration in North Korea. A new assessment of North Korea has come in one of three classified reports commissioned by the Bush administration earlier this year from the American intelligence community.
.
Circulated last month, the report concluded that nearly 20 months of toughened sanctions, including ending a major energy program, and several rounds of negotiations involving four of North Korea's neighbors had not slowed the North's efforts to develop plutonium weapons, and that a separate, parallel program to make weapons from highly enriched uranium was also moving forward, though more slowly.
.
The desire to pursue a broader strategy against Iran's nuclear ambitions is driven in part, officials say, by increasingly strong private statements by Israeli officials that they will not tolerate the development of an Iranian nuclear weapon and may be forced to consider military action similar to the attack against a nuclear reactor in Iraq two decades ago if Tehran is judged to be on the verge of making a weapon.
.
In contrast, North Korea's neighbors are seeking stability first and disarmament as a longer-term goal, diplomats from the region say.
.
"The evidence suggests that Iran is trying to keep all of its options open," said Robert Gates, the director of central intelligence under President George H.W. Bush.
.
Gates recently headed a detailed study of Iran that was critical of what it called the administration's failure to engage the country.
.
"They are trying to stay just within their treaty obligations" while producing highly enriched uranium, said Gates, "and I think they can go with a weapon whenever they want to."
.
Over the past few weeks, five senior officials from the administration and Asian and European nations, with varying access to the intelligence about the Iranian and North Korean programs, were interviewed about the status of those programs. Not surprisingly, their judgments about the progress the two countries have made were not always in accord.
.
The new report on North Korea, which has circulated among senior U.S. officials and been described to some allies and to The New York Times, appears to have been written far more cautiously than the National Intelligence Estimate that erroneously described advanced weapons programs in Iraq. It describes in detail vast gaps in American knowledge. For example, it acknowledges that the whereabouts of North Korea's stockpile of more than 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods has been a mystery since early 2003, but also concludes that the North has had plenty of time to reprocess the rods into enough fuel for six to eight additional weapons. North Korea is judged to have two to six weapons already. For its part, Iran has begun to assemble the necessary ingredients and perhaps the same crude, Chinese-origin bomb design that the Khan network sold to Libya - and may be just a few years away, intelligence experts have said. Taken together, the intelligence conclusions pose both security and political challenges for President George W. Bush.
.
Bush has said he would not "tolerate" either country becoming a nuclear power, ignoring, at least publicly, the near certainty that North Korea has already reached that status. But he has never defined that term, or set deadlines for progress. He is already under attack by the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John Kerry, for allowing both countries to spring forward in their programs while the White House concentrated on the one member of the "axis of evil," Iraq, which turned out to have virtually no evidence of a continuing program.
.
Bush has said little about the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs in recent months, in sharp contrast to his regular recitations about the danger posed by Iraq in the period before the war last year.
.
"It's very frustrating," said one former official who left the Bush administration recently and who believes that the administration has failed to draw clear "red lines" beyond which North Korea would not be allowed to expand its arsenal. The official noted that Bush and his aides have been talking as if North Korea and Iran would follow the model of Libya, which disarmed earlier this year in an effort to reintegrate its economy with the West. But, the official argued, Iran does not need to do that because it has robust trade with Europe, and North Korea still receives considerable aid from China.
.
On July 31, Iran announced that it was resuming the production of centrifuges needed to produce highly enriched uranium, though it said it was still "suspending" actual enrichment activities. While the United States has threatened to take the issue to the UN Security Council, it has yet to win support from many allies.
.
North Korea has publicly rejected a new U.S. initiative to allow international aid to flow gradually to the country in return for speedy disarmament and giving inspectors the right to examine any suspected site.
.
Several of Bush's aides have said they expect little concrete progress before the presidential election. The Iranians appear to be betting that Kerry, if elected, would talk directly to their leaders.
.
The New York Times 
Rice says world watches Iran
.
The U.S. national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said Sunday that the world finally was "worried and suspicious" over the Iranians' intentions and was determined not to let Tehran produce a nuclear weapon, The Associated Press reported from Washington.
.
Rice also said the Bush administration had seen a new international willingness to act against Iran's nuclear program. She credited the changed attitude to the Americans' insistence that Iran's effort has put the world in peril.

Nuclear proliferation
 
While unexpected, the decision by the Bush administration last month to oppose inspections and verification as part of the Fissile Materials Cutoff Treaty is not surprising. Since taking office, the administration has taken a number of steps that have undermined the ability of the United States and the world community to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
.
But given the fact that Bush agrees with most analysts that the greatest danger facing the United States is a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of a rogue state or terrorist group, his actions are counterproductive and defy good sense.
.
The fissile materials cutoff would ban the production of enriched uranium and plutonium, the two ingredients used for setting off a chain reaction nuclear explosion. It was designed to reinforce the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and impose restraints on the three nuclear powers which are not parties to that treaty.
.
By refusing to establish an inspection regime for the fissile materials cutoff, the Bush administration has thwarted a 10-year effort by the international community to lure Pakistan, India and Israel into accepting some oversight of their nuclear production programs.
.
The Nonproliferation Treaty strikes a grand bargain among the five declared nuclear powers and the rest of the world that the non-nuclear states will not develop nuclear weapons, in return for which the nuclear powers will reduce and eventually eliminate their own nuclear weapons.
.
Since coming into office, the Bush administration has undermined this reciprocal arrangement in a variety of ways, despite the fact that it could make America safer and more secure.
.
First, instead of eliminating nuclear weapons, the Bush administration is seeking funds to develop two new nuclear weapons, a low yield "mini-nuke" and a robust nuclear earth penetrator or "bunker buster." Second, because the development of these new weapons will require testing, the administration has refused to submit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for ratification and has instead sought funds to ready the Nevada test site for future testing. In its proposed 2005 budget, the administration has requested $6.8 billion for conducting research and expanding U.S. nuclear capabilities.
.
This is twice the amount the U.S. spent in this area a decade ago.
.
Third, since these new nuclear weapons are in reality first-use weapons, the administration has revised its nuclear strategy. In its December 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, the administration made clear that it would be prepared to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states, including launching preemptive attacks with nuclear weapons against nations that were close to acquiring nuclear arsenals.
.
This new strategy may well have led North Korea and Iran to accelerate their own nuclear programs.
.
Fourth, while arguing that other nations cannot withdraw from the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Bush administration itself withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and has actually deployed a national missile defense system in Alaska. Although this system is designed to combat an intercontinental missile threat from North Korea, it has already provoked Russia to increase its nuclear capabilities and may well provoke China to do the same.
.
In addition to undermining the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Bush administration has weakened America's own nonproliferation efforts. For example, it has decreased funding for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction initiative that has deactivated more than 6,000 nuclear warheads in the former Soviet Union.
.
Moreover, while the administration signed a Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia that commits both sides to reduce the number of operationally deployed nuclear weapons to between 1,700 and 2, 000 by Dec. 30, 2012, it plans to keep another 3,000 nuclear weapons in storage, refuses to include new verification mechanisms in the treaty, and has not agreed to compliance beyond 2012.
.
Preventing Iraq from acquiring nuclear weapons or passing them on to a terrorist group like Al Qaeda was a primary justification for a war that has caused thousands of American casualties and cost the American taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars.
.
Yet in its approach to nonproliferation, the administration is doing things that increase the dangers of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.

ATHENS After years of suffering the skeptics and all their "never on Sunday" jokes about Greek efficiency, the organizers of the Summer Olympics in Athens say that everything needed for the Games is ready - or just about.
.
It happened just under the wire, but marble-clad subway stations are open, the trains are running, miles of new highways and overpasses are finished, security cameras are in place, stadium seats are finally installed and thousands of police officers and soldiers are on patrol. Bomb-sniffing dogs have completed their sweeps of most of the 37 sports venues, some of them architectural wonders that were messy construction sites only a few weeks ago.
.
"I think people should give us a break," said Mayor Dora Bakoyannis, whose employees are still working overtime planting trees, cutting curbs for the handicapped and washing down statues for Friday's opening ceremony.
.
While some Greek officials have expressed a sense of defiant pride at their frenzied rush to the finish, the last-minute preparations for the Games have created a few security headaches for an event that could provide a tempting target for terrorists.
.
Athens is a city of 4.5 million people and thousands of tourists, and large crowds are expected to gather not only for the Olympics but also for dozens of smaller outdoor cultural events planned by the city. While Giorgos Voulgarakis, the minister of public order, has said Greece has prepared itself as well as humanly possible against potential threats, the last-minute completion of many Olympic sites has prompted some worry.
.
The government has also quarreled with the American company Science Applications International, which was hired to provide an elaborate security system to spot suspicious activity and give early warnings if chemical, biological or nuclear weapons are detonated. The two sides are now involved in a dispute over what the contract entailed. The system relies on a grid of surveillance and tracking devices, including a blimp full of cameras and recording devices that now floats above the city, to collect, integrate and analyze data for use by the police and Greek military. Problems with the system's communications software delayed its full implementation, which in turn kept the 4,000 people in Greece's command and control center from having hands-on practice with it until last week. The late finish of many of the Olympic sites also delayed the installation and testing of security equipment.
.
The system became fully operational after the software issues were resolved on Aug. 1, according to a spokesman for the Public Order Ministry. Last Friday, the various Greek ministries that are supposed to respond to any incidents were still ironing out "last-minute issues," the spokesman said.
.
Athens has had seven years to pull the Games together, but the Greek government, the city and the original organizing committee dawdled until the International Olympics Committee gave them a stern warning in 2000.
.
A burst of energy brought progress on many of the infrastructure improvements that Athens had promised for the Games. But the general impression conveyed by the construction stops and starts was of barely controlled chaos.
.
For a while it seemed the Greeks were trying to jinx their own efforts.
.
Animal welfare groups objected to the roundup of stray dogs. Environmentalists said the new projects would waste water and energy. Labor unions were peeved at not getting the same $3,000 bonuses offered to police officers and soldiers. Prostitutes claimed the police were picking on them, and people who did not like security cameras claimed they were being spied on.
.
Even Bakoyannis, the mayor, who had grown accustomed to the constant carping of her constituents, was taken aback when "feminists" attacked her for saying that Athens badly needed a facelift.
.
In the end, the government threw fiscal caution to the winds, authorizing massive amounts of overtime and bonuses for workers to finish the projects and promise to stay on their jobs until the Games end on Aug. 28. When television broadcasters asked for different lighting, security officials wanted more soldiers and other athletic groups suggested add-ons and changes, the Olympics organizers agreed and plowed ahead.
.
"We didn't say 'no' to anybody," said Fanni Palli-Petralia, the deputy culture minister in charge of the government's Olympics efforts. "Whatever was asked, we did." She said she could not say how much the whole effort would end up costing. "But it will be huge," she said.
.
Other government officials have said that cost overruns, extra overtime pay and unexpected security costs had already pushed the Olympics total past $7 billion. Privately, some officials said they feared the final cost of putting on the Olympics might surpass $10 billion.
.
In the past three weeks alone, authorities have opened up a subway line, four subway stations, suburban rail stations, a pedestrian bridge, parking garages, superhighways and tunnels. As a result, Athens is no longer a dowdy, down-at-the-heels capital. Trees, plants and grass have been planted - or left strategically in pots on city squares - and flattering lighting has been set up at sites like the Acropolis.
.
"It's not so green as we wanted," Palli-Petralia acknowledged. "We wanted to have big trees, and they are not so big now. But they will grow."
.
In their relief at having gotten this far, many Olympic officials said that Greece had proved itself to those outside skeptics who doubted it could make up for all the lost time.
.
"People believed the Greeks are never disciplined," said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the president of the national Olympics organizing committee. With preparations nearly finished, she said, "I feel fortunate and satisfied and proud."
.
Her exuberance is a sign of how much Greece has invested, if belatedly, in the Olympics, said Theodore Couloumbis, director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy.
.
"These Olympics will be decisive in terms of finalizing our transition to self-esteem," he said. "No more insecurities, which in turn create this kind of bravado that says, we are the best, we are the chosen, we are surrounded by enemies and everything that is wrong is the result of a conspiracy in Washington or New York. Finally, we can create the impression we are a normal European country."

JERUSALEM The Israeli military opened the border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt on Friday, permitting an estimated 2,000 stranded Palestinians to return home for the first time since July 18.
.
Israel kept the crossing closed during that time, saying it was concerned about a possible attack. Palestinians stranded at the terminal on the Egyptian side of the border included pregnant women and some who had gone for medical treatment in Egypt.
.
The first group of stranded travelers arrived in Gaza early Friday, according to news reports. Nihad Abu Jazar, 22, a third-year student at Cairo University, had waited for 21 days to cross the terminal. Jumping off the bus, Abu Jazar fell into the arms of her relatives, tears streaming down her face.
.
She said she was forced to violate Islamic custom by being constantly in the presence of men. She said she almost broke down several times and returned to Cairo. "But every time I convinced myself that they might open any time, and to be honest I don't have enough money," she told The Associated Press.
.
The travelers spent the first week sleeping on the ground, Abu Jazar said. Later, the Egyptians and charity organizations brought basic supplies, including mattresses. But there were not enough toilet facilities, and people were forced to stand for hours waiting to use the facilities.
.
Palestinians, foreign governments and human rights groups had raised concerns about the worsening conditions on the border, where three pregnant women had suffered miscarriages in recent days.
.
The Israeli army said Thursday that it had been "in permanent contact with international humanitarian organizations" during the closure. Israel had offered to open an alternate crossing, but the proposal was rejected by Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, both saying it would violate existing border agreements with Israel.
.
During the closure, hundreds of Palestinians slept outdoors on the ground near the Rafah terminal, while others waited at hostels or returned to Cairo. Earlier this week, Egypt warned of a humanitarian crisis.
.
Israel Army Radio said the crossing would be open for extra hours Friday and Saturday to allow travelers to return home as quickly as possible.
.
The Haaretz newspaper's Web site reported that U.S. pressure forced Israel to reopen the crossing. Under terms of interim peace accords, Israel controls the crossings between the Palestinian territories and neighboring countries.
.
Meanwhile, Israel is pursuing a plan to link Jerusalem and the largest settlement in the West Bank, Maale Adumim, the settlement's mayor was quoted as saying on Thursday.
.
Benny Kashriel, the mayor of Maale Adumim, told the Maariv newspaper that government ministries were working to expand the settlement westward and effectively connect it to Jerusalem, about four miles away. Such a move would go against the Middle East peace plan, which calls for a freeze on Israeli settlement activity. Maale Adumim is sensitive because it is so large and so close to Jerusalem. The Palestinians want a future capital in east Jerusalem, but Arab neighborhoods in that part of the city are increasingly surrounded by Jewish settlements.
.
This week, Israel's Defense Ministry confirmed a separate plan to build 600 more homes in Maale Adumim. The U.S. State Department responded by urging Israel to stick by its pledge to halt settlement expansion. On Thursday evening, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told the U.S. envoy Elliott Abrams that Israel was not planning to connect Maale Adumim to Jerusalem, the Israeli media reported.
.
In another development, Israel will permit some Palestinian police in the West Bank to resume carrying weapons in public for the first time in more than two years, The Associated Press reported, citing Israeli officials.

Failure to handle drug issue alleged
 
Less than three weeks before the Olympics in Athens, the chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee has harshly criticized the leadership of the U.S. track federation for failing to admit the seriousness of the drug problem in the sport. He also warned that after the games, the Olympic committee would take a much harder look at the sport.
.
As the scandal from the U.S. investigation of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative continues to shake track and field, Jim Scherr, the chief executive of the USOC, said he was disturbed that the drug-related issues had dominated pre-Games attention and taken it away from athletes who rarely find the spotlight.
.
Six athletes entered the Olympic track and field trials in Sacramento, California, having been charged with doping violations by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. And during the Olympic trials, it was revealed that three athletes had tested positive for banned substances before competition began.
.
Two runners who qualified for the U.S. Olympic team, Torri Edwards and Calvin Harrison, are in the midst of their drug-hearing procedures, and Marion Jones is under investigation but has not been charged.
.
Scherr said he recognized that the anti-doping agency, which is an independent agency, controlled the drug testing.
.
But based on the proliferation of positive tests, he said in a telephone interview Monday, the leaders of track "either haven't done enough or have been negligent and/or have somehow slipped on that responsibility."
.
Scherr said he believed that USA Track Field was not sending the right message to athletes, coaches and agents about the use of performance-enhancing drugs.
.
"There has to be an attitude and leadership among the influencers and powerful people in the sport that it's simply not acceptable," Scherr said. "Those among that group of track and field did not take the issue as seriously as they should have or as soon as they should have."
.
Craig Masback, the chief executive of USA Track Field, defended his federation's handling of the issue.
.
"Clearly our view is that, one, we take responsibility, and two, if a single athlete tests positive, it's a serious problem," Masback said.
.
In June, before the Olympic trials, Masback identified the problem as a "small subculture" of cheaters. On Monday, he cited the small number of positive tests. According to the doping agency, 11 of the 22 athletes penalized this year are in track and field.
.
"This is not a track problem alone, it's a sports problem in America," Masback said, adding that the federation had outlined 10 steps to fulfill its zero-tolerance policy. Those initiatives include drug education for members, the creation of a whistle-blower program and the institution of more punitive measures. But only the anti-doping agency can penalize an athlete.
.
Based on current results, Scherr said, zero tolerance has not been very effective. Scherr sent a strong message to USA Track Field about putting athletes on relay teams who either have trials pending or could represent a risk of retroactive suspension after the games for a drug charge.
.
"USA Track Field needs to be careful in communicating with coaches, when somebody is under some sort of process, that perhaps that person should be kept off to the relay until the process is settled," Scherr said.
.
"We wouldn't recommend that directly to them; it is something we would hope they would take into account from their experience."
.
The way USA Track Field handled the case of the sprinter Jerome Young incensed the Olympic committee, the international track community and world anti-doping leaders and led to the creation of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.
.
Young was found guilty of a doping offense in 2000, then was exonerated on appeal by a USA Track Field arbitration panel. He ran in qualifying rounds of the gold-medal-winning 1,600-meter relay team at the Olympics that year in Sydney. Citing privacy rules, USA Track Field did not divulge his name to the International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body.
.
Last month, the world body overturned the Young decision, barred him retroactively for two years and recommended that his relay teammates be stripped of its medals.
.
In 2003, the USOC threatened to decertify USA Track Field for its lack of cooperation in the Young case. The year before, the committee made the same threat, demanding that the federation improve its financial reporting and drug testing facilities.
.
As for decertification, Scherr said, "I can't say that's where it's heading, but the situation will be looked at by our board, and there will be serious discussion with the leadership."
.
The New York Times






E-mail, text messaging and Internet access from mobile phones were little more than futuristic ideas and overhyped promises at the time of the Sydney Olympics in 2000.
.
But the recent European soccer tournament gave a glimpse of how much the wireless world has changed since then and what next month's Olympics in Athens might bring.
.
About 680,000 foreign visitors roamed onto the Vodafone mobile network in Portugal over the four weeks of the Euro 2004 competition there in June and July, and more than two million voice calls and 5.9 million text messages originated on cellphones in and around the Lisbon stadium.
.
On July 4, the day of the final match between Portugal and Greece, voice calls increased 600 percent and text messaging by 1,500 percent over the previous day, Bobby Leach, a Vodafone spokesman, said.
.
The Athens Olympics will attract far more spectators - about five million over 17 days, compared with 1.2 million over 23 days in Lisbon - causing some to question the ability of cellular networks in Greece to handle the unprecedented volume.
.
Never before will so many people have brought so many mobile phones to such a limited space. People are more dependent than ever on wireless devices to stay in touch, arrange meeting places, find hotels or check schedules.
.
There is a psychological dependency as well. Michael Hulme, a professor at the University of Lancaster in England who has conducted studies on the role of mobile phones in people's lives, said spectators had a high incentive to make calls. With the ability to describe an event in real time, "we become celebrities within our own production, and the mobile phone is our production tool," he said.
.
As dependency grows, so do expectations. Business people who attend conferences such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, are familiar with overwhelmed networks that end in dropped calls. But after 12 years of steady improvement in European GSM networks, many people now see cell service the same way they see electricity: They expect it to work, no matter what demands are placed upon it.
.
For the Sydney Games, the telecommunications carrier Telstra said it handled a total of 10 million calls, which amounted to an extra 1.5 million minutes of traffic daily from about four million visitors. As much as 10 percent of calls did not get through, but Telstra considered its performance a success.
.
Because of the added variable of increasingly popular phone e-mail and Internet traffic for this Olympics, however, "in many respects it is unknown territory," said Reg Coutts, an independent consultant who worked at Telstra's mobile unit before the Sydney Olympics.
.
Coutts said that the dominant mobile technology in Athens, called GPRS, did not easily accommodate increases in use, "and there is a real risk that it might not be able to handle traffic demand."
.
During the Olympics:
.
Samsung will supply the Athens Organizing Committee and VIPs - about 14,000 people - with a mobile phone for real-time scoring, event timetables and logistics, said Jay Choi, Samsung's Olympic technology director.
.
Cosmote Mobile Telecommunications, an official Olympic sponsor, plans to showcase its third-generation mobile service, introduced in May, which offers video calls and Internet browsing at 10 times the speed of GPRS.
.
A multilingual "tourist guide" cellphone service from Cosmote, using voice-recognition and location-based technology, will give users details about restaurants, beaches, archaeological sites, museums, theater shows, transportation schedules and emergency phone numbers.
.
Cosmote said it was working in close cooperation with Vodafone Greece and TIM in Greece, as well as mobile operators outside the country, to ensure a smooth flow of mobile traffic and said it anticipated no problems.
.
It has invested more than E50 million, or $62 million, to upgrade its mobile phone infrastructure in Athens, the surrounding Attica region and the five other Olympic cities in time for the Games.
.
Within the Olympic stadium, the Cosmote network capacity will be increased as much as 15-fold, the company said. Five new base station control centers, a mobile telephony center and a GPRS customer service center are also being added.

Leadership in Paris
 
PARIS No other European country fascinates Americans as much as France does. It is a morbid interest, no doubt, usually inspired by annoyance or fury at France's resistance to American rectitude, expressed in condescending comment on France's assumed backwardness - or, in the preferred epithet of the Bush administration, its "irrelevance."
.
But if France were irrelevant, of course, no one would bother.
.
The French earned anger last year for blocking United Nations Security Council approval of the American and British invasion of Iraq. Iraq will undoubtedly provide next year's argument as well, since uprisings and disintegration in that country are sure to continue. A re-elected George W. Bush or a newly elected John Kerry will redouble the national stake in the losing game; both now seem committed to that.
.
President Jacques Chirac of France is written off by Washington as adamantly against further European implication in America's Middle Eastern adventure. Hence American interest in his replacement, and in the challenge offered Chirac by Nicolas Sarkozy, the economics minister. He is the ambitious son of Hungarian immigrants, a lawyer rather than a product of the established French "grandes ecoles" system, which serves as a feeder to government posts.
.
He recently visited the United States, wangled an interview with Secretary of State Colin Powell, and conducted himself with the press, as he does at home, as the man about to take over France.
.
This excited much interest among Americans, who had never heard of him before. But Sarkozy somewhat damaged his presentation as the cosmopolitan European by insisting on speaking English, which he doesn't do very well.
.
Sarkozy excited conservatives by suggesting that he is a great admirer of American ways of economic management, lauding the American entrepreneurial spirit and suggesting that France has a lot to learn.
.
As France's newly appointed economics minister, however, he has supported state sponsorship of "national champions" in industry, sought an easing of European rules on balanced budgets, and in other respects disappointed the American Enterprise Institute and The Wall Street Journal.
.
Although he currently is vastly popular among the militants of the presidential party, the UMP, which he is expected to try to take over, Sarkozy will not become president, at least not in 2007.
.
His aggressive ways may erode his youthful charm during the three years that remain before the scheduled presidential election. His enemies, Chirac first among them, have time to act. He lacks gravitas, the seriousness and maturity that the French have in the past expected in their presidents. He speaks in the popular idiom and, to some ears, with a trace of foreign accent.
.
Despite much concern in France over the economy and the prospects of a European Union with 25 members, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin may prove a sounder political bet for the long run. Most commentators in France would seem to disagree, but some share my view.
.
In his cautious way, Raffarin has managed to put through significant reforms in the national health system and the retirement regime of government functionaries, as well as decentralizing the administration. His conservative predecessor in the first Chirac presidency, Alain Jupp, tried similar reforms and provoked something like a popular revolt.
.
The daily newspaper Le Monde has campaigned against Raffarin for some time, and the Socialist Party demands his replacement because the government parties lost badly in regional and European elections this spring. The people have repudiated the government, it argues.
.
The left wants very much to return to the parliamentary system of the Third and Fourth Republics, which they believe more authentically democratic. It argues that as the government has been defeated on regional issues and in the election for the European Parliament, Chirac should call new national elections.
.
The left is hoist by its own petard. It, as well as a part of the right, wanted, and in 2002 got, a reduction in the presidential term from seven to five years, a fundamental constitutional change. If France had stayed with the old seven-year presidential term, meant to produce nonconcordant terms for president and Parliament, which is elected for five years, the left would have a better case to make.
.
Under the old Constitution, a government's electoral defeat or severe setback was expected to cause the president either to call for a new Parliament - and resign if it failed to support him - or appoint a nonpartisan prime minister and cabinet.
.
That Gaullist assumption has been defied by both of Charles de Gaulle's successors, Franois Mitterrand, a Socialist, and the post-Gaullist Chirac. They preferred to run no personal political risks. The result is that the present government will last until its term is up, and American hopes that Paris might return to "relevance" will have to be postponed, once again.

A role for artists
 
NEW YORK A nation's artists and musicians have a particular place in its social and political life. Over the years I've tried to think long and hard about what it means to be American: about the distinctive identity and position we have in the world, and how that position is best carried. I've tried to write songs that speak to our pride and criticize our failures.
.
These questions are at the heart of this year's presidential election: who we are, what we stand for, why we fight. Personally, for the last 25 years I have always stayed one step away from partisan politics. Instead, I have been partisan about a set of ideals: economic justice, civil rights, a humane foreign policy, freedom and a decent life for all of our citizens. This year, however, for many of us the stakes have risen too high to sit this election out.
.
Through my work, I've always tried to ask hard questions. Why is it that the wealthiest nation in the world finds it so hard to keep its promise and faith with its weakest citizens? Why do we continue to find it so difficult to see beyond the veil of race? How do we conduct ourselves during difficult times without killing the things we hold dear? Why does the fulfillment of our promise as a people always seem to be just within grasp yet forever out of reach?
.
I don't think John Kerry and John Edwards have all the answers. I do believe they are sincerely interested in asking the right questions and working their way toward honest solutions. They understand that we need an administration that places a priority on fairness, curiosity, openness, humility, concern for all America's citizens, courage and faith.
.
People have different notions of these values, and they live them out in different ways. I've tried to sing about some of them in my songs. But I have my own ideas about what they mean, too. That is why I plan to join with many fellow artists, including the Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, REM, the Dixie Chicks, Jurassic 5, James Taylor and Jackson Browne, in touring the United States this October. We will be performing under the umbrella of a new group called Vote for Change. Our goal is to change the direction of the government and change the current administration come November.
.
Like many others, in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, I felt America's unity. I don't remember anything quite like it. I supported the decision to enter Afghanistan and I hoped that the seriousness of the times would bring forth strength, humility and wisdom in our leaders.
.
Instead, America dived headlong into an unnecessary war in Iraq, offering up the lives of our young men and women under circumstances that are now discredited. We ran record deficits, while cutting and squeezing services like after-school programs. We granted tax cuts to the richest 1 percent (corporate bigwigs, well-to-do guitar players), increasing the division of wealth that threatens to destroy our social contract with one another and render mute the promise of "one nation indivisible."
.
It is through the truthful exercising of the best of human qualities - respect for others, honesty about ourselves, faith in our ideals - that we come to life in God's eyes. It is how our soul, as a nation and as individuals, is revealed. Our American government has strayed too far from American values. It is time to move forward. The country we carry in our hearts is waiting.

The Yukos affair
 
NEW YORK Last week the Russian government took steps to seize and sell the prize asset of Russia's largest oil company, Yukos, toward payment of the company's nearly $6.8 billion in back taxes. This Yukos asset, Yuganskneftegaz, is a production facility that accounts for 70 percent of Yukos' reserves and produces roughly 60 percent of all Yukos oil - a production level about the same as Indonesia's.
.
This and other recent developments - including the arrest last week on multiple murder charges of the company's largest shareholder, a close friend of Yukos's chief executive - make clear that Yukos's existence as a viable company is in jeopardy. Despite Yukos's offer Wednesday to sell its gas subsidiary Rosplan - things are not looking good.
.
This is all more than a little surprising, because President Vladimir Putin told reporters just last month during a visit to Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, that "Russian officials, the government and economic officials of the country are not interested in bankrupting a company like Yukos."
.
Investors in Russia were ready to take those words to the bank. After all, if Vladimir Putin said he didn't want to see a bankrupt Yukos, then the oil giant wouldn't face bankruptcy. Right?
.
But Yukos is now facing bankruptcy.
.
Russia watchers remain interested in the long and winding Yukos saga for two reasons. First, Yukos pumps about 1.7 million barrels a day, or about 2 percent of the world's oil. Its actions produce ripple effects well beyond Russia's borders. Second, the fate of Yukos's chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, currently in prison on tax evasion and fraud charges, may offer insight into Russian tax reform and Putin's intentions toward the so-called oligarchs.
.
Is the Kremlin sending a powerful message to Russia's business elite to stay out of politics? Is Putin hoping to nationalize the energy industry again? Will loyal supporters be rewarded with valuable assets, such as control of major companies at bargain-basement prices?
.
In other words, is the Yukos case just about Yukos? The answer appears to be no. Putin and several of his advisers have stressed, publicly and privately, that several oligarchs have not paid sufficient taxes on the assets they picked up in the fire-sale privatizations of the 1990s. While the government's next moves are not likely to be as spectacular as the high-profile arrests and subsequent asset-stripping at Yukos, the Kremlin will probably continue to revisit the asset valuations of major Russian companies in an effort to reassert state control over such extractive industries as oil, gas and metals.
.
There is another, more interesting, question: Given that the Kremlin is pushing Yukos directly toward bankruptcy, why did Putin say publicly last month that the bankruptcy of Yukos was not in the government's interests? Why would he publicly signal one intention and then do the opposite, particularly in a case watched so closely by international investors?
.
Putin's claim that he would not interfere with the judiciary in the bankruptcy case isn't credible. The Kremlin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest and Putin was directly involved in the timing and charges filed. Even key ministers - most recently, Finance Minister German Gref - have publicly acknowledged that the charges against Khodorkovsky were, at least in part, political.
.
So what are we to make of the gap between Putin's statements and his government's actions? There appear to be three possible explanations.
.
First, Putin's statement last month may have allowed Khodorkovsky to believe he had more leverage than he really had to negotiate his way out of his legal and financial troubles. Thus, he decided to hold out for a deal to keep Yukos mostly intact - a deal insufficiently favorable to the Kremlin, and, in the end, Putin decided that bringing him toward a deal acceptable to the Kremlin was not politically expedient.
.
The second possibility is that Putin genuinely didn't want Yukos to face bankruptcy but didn't have the power to prevent it. The Kremlin's security services faction wanted a shot at picking up Yukos' assets in what would amount to a rigged bankruptcy auction, and perhaps a new cadre of shadowy oligarchs were simply able to outmaneuver the president.
.
The third scenario is that Putin never intended to allow Yukos to remain intact but made the conciliatory comment in a cynical attempt to talk up the Yukos share price. In the process, Putin would reward the loyalty of friends and supporters, who would stand to earn significant profits through timely investments in Russian stocks.
.
The markets, of course, prefer the first scenario. Investors want to believe that Putin means what he says and that his statements dovetail with his actions. Blaming Khodorkovsky for the ruin of Yukos investors means that Putin, at least, can be trusted. This theory does not, however, explain why the Kremlin intended that a majority of Yukos production be sold off at 10 percent, or less, of its value. Even with no deal with Khodorkovsky in place, the Kremlin could still have sold Yukos assets at auction, or even to the state, at a reasonable market price - with relatively little adverse market perception.
.
The second scenario - that Putin's power is checked by others in the Kremlin - is the most troubling for the markets, suggesting as it does that unknown forces are making market-relevant decisions and will have significant influence on Russia's future business climate.
.
But this also seems unlikely, given Putin's considerable consolidation of power over the past three years - through his increased influence in Parliament, his direct authority over state power through the creation of super-governors and super-ministries, and his control of Russia's broadcast media.
.
The third scenario, unfortunately, rings most true. It tars Putin and his government with corruption, something market watchers have been loathe to contemplate. But it is worth remembering that Russia's former prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov - known as "Misha 2 Percent" for the amount he allegedly skimmed from business deals in which he involved himself - remained in power and close to the Kremlin for almost all of Putin's first term, far longer than observers expected.
.
Unfortunately, of all the plausible explanations, the most likely scenario is that the Russian president sought to influence the market. That suspicion will likely give international investors pause as they consider whether or not to invest in Russian energy projects.
.
If friends of the Kremlin want their 2 percent of a company that pumps 2 percent of the world's oil, they will probably get it. The Yukos affair certainly seems headed in that direction. But the pall that such a suspicion casts over investor confidence in the Kremlin's willingness to create a level business playing field could wind up, in the long run, costing Russia's economy far more.

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has been named. Ralph Fiennes, who played evil guys in "Red Dragon" and "Schindler's List," has signed on to portray the wicked warlock Voldemortin the next "Harry Potter" movie, Warner Bros. has announced. Voldemort is so bad that the magical characters in J.K. Rowling's stories try not to speak his name aloud. In the first three installments of the saga, a deadly magic spell meant for a baby Harry Potter backfired and deprived Voldemort of a body. But he returns in the flesh in part four, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." Filming has been under way since June 25, with Daniel Radcliffeas the boy-wizard. Other additions to the cast include Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, a gossip columnist for a magical newspaper. The film, directed by Mike Newell, is scheduled for release in November 2005.

US Airways passengers who left Logan Airport in Boston 20 minutes late were delayed further when their Washington-bound plane made an unscheduled stop in Albany, New York, and picked up President George W. Bush's twin daughters.Jenna and Barbara Bush were among 38 passengers stranded Saturday after an Albany-to-Washington flight was canceled because of maintenance problems. The airline decided to send the plane from Boston to pick up the daughters and 22 others on the flight. A US Airways spokesman said the airline diverted the flight under a policy designed to accommodate passengers on canceled flights when possible. He said the fact that the Bush twins were among them had nothing to do with the decision.

The actor Will Smith delighted fans in London with a concert outside the Odeon theater in Leicester Square before the British premiere of his latest film, "I, Robot." Accompanied by DJ Jazzy Jeff, Smith performed for about 3,000 people Wednesday. The set included the hits "Summertime" and "Men in Black," and Smith's latest single, "Switch." "When you have these kind of events everybody can't get in," said Smith, 35. "I wanted to give the people who came to support me a little treat out here."

English Heritage, guardian of various historic sites in Britain, is advertising for someone to be the nation's first court jester since 1649. An ad appearing in Thursday's editions of The Times laid out the qualifications: "Must be mirthful and prepared to work summer weekends in 2005. Must have own outfit (with bells). Bladder on stick provided if required." Auditions will be held Saturday at Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire. The jester's position died along with King Charles I, who was executed by Oliver Cromwell's supporters in 1649.

Katharine Hepburn's waterfront home in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, has been sold to a neighbor who plans to renovate the property. Frank Sciame, a New York City-based architect, signed a contract to buy the home, said Hepburn's real estate agent. She wouldn't reveal the sale amount, but said it was under the $12 million asking price. The house, which overlooks Long Island Sound, has nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms and five fireplaces. Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.

CANBERRA Over the last couple of years Norma Khouri and I have found ourselves performing at Australian literary festivals. During book-signing sessions, I would look wistfully at the long queues waiting for an endorsement from the hand that wrote "Forbidden Love."
.
Described as a true story, the book (published in the United States, to much less notice, under the title "Honor Lost") tells of Dalia, Khouri's closest friend in Jordan, who was stabbed to death by her bigoted Muslim father after she fell in love with a Christian soldier. The haunting cover photograph of an Arab beauty peeping mysteriously from behind a chador seemed to encapsulate the author herself - a brave, soulful Arab woman campaigning with all her heart against Muslim honor killings.

Having sold more than 200,000 copies here, "Forbidden Love" has by Australian standards been a runaway bestseller, and Khouri has become a star. It's not hard to see why. She's a compelling performer, and her book had all the ingredients of a romance novel in chador, but with the extra cachet of truth.
.
Now "Forbidden Love" has been withdrawn from sale. Norma Khouri's elaborate dual fabrication started to unravel when a Jordanian women's rights advocate, Amal al-Sabbagh, became suspicious of the book's topographical inconsistencies, cultural gaffes and whiffs of ideology. She and her colleagues uncovered scores of errors, including, they said, the nonexistence of Dalia and her punitive father. Back in Australia, a journalist fluent in Arabic was also puzzled by Khouri's rudimentary grasp of her native tongue.
.
Malcolm Knox, a Sydney journalist, began an inquiry that led him to the neat brick duplexes of Chicago's Southwest Side. There he found Khouri's mother, Asma Bagain, and learned that Khouri herself had moved from Jordan to the United States at age 3. Further digging uncovered a sad trail of inventions, duplicities, domestic squabbles and evaporated dreams. Married to a John Toliopoulos, who, reports say, is being sought by the FBI after being accused in a real-estate fraud, Khouri decamped in 1999 without leaving a forwarding address.
.
In Australia, these revelations have provoked soul-searching, particularly among the literati. Why did we, known for wry cynicism, prove so susceptible to her fictions? Did she realize that this country has long been a Mecca for literary frauds?
.
One of our most cherished modern poets, Ern Malley, was actually a brilliant spoof devised by two conservatives who wanted to ridicule the fatuities of 1940s literary trends. In recent times, Australian literary hoaxes have been motivated by the desire to manufacture stories that conform to marketable fashions. In 1995, Helen Darville won a swag of literary awards for a quasi-historical novel about the Holocaust in the Ukraine that gained extra force from her assumed identity as Helen Demidenko. A real-life Serbian immigrant, Streten Bozic, found it easier, however, to get published as an Aboriginal named B. Wongar. A Sydney taxi driver, Leon Carmen, produced a heartfelt memoir called "My Own Sweet Time" written in the guise of an Aboriginal woman called Wanda Koolmatrie.
.
It is understandable why Norma Khouri might imagine Australia to be a congenial place to remake herself. Our melting pot of migrants has offered plentiful opportunities for those who want to shuck off old identities.
.
But Australia has a tradition of trenchant investigative journalism with a taste for unearthing dodgy pasts. So how do we explain the tardiness of Norma Khouri's exposure?
.
The answer is that everyone was disarmed by her palpable sincerity. Observers couldn't help being moved by her visceral anguish and her ardor to rectify the wrongs of Jordanian women. Sometimes, it seems, a new identity can be taken up with the force of a conversion. For people trapped in shabby pasts, a new persona can offer liberating as much as predatory opportunity.
.
Khouri's imposture doesn't mean that she lacks literary ability. Had "Forbidden Love" been a novel, there would have been little fuss, for it is a good read. Successful charlatanism is, after all, a type of artistry that demands great psychological insight and empathy - qualities that don't go amiss in a writer. The test will come when Norma Khouri decides to write her own real-life memoir, not as a Jordanian exotic but as a girl from the Southwest Side of Chicago.
