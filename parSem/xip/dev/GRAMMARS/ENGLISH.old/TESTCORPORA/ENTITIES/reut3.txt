 MEXICO: Japanese prime minister arrives in Mexico. 
 Japanese prime minister arrives in Mexico. 
 MEXICO CITY 1996-08-20
 
 Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto arrived in Mexico on Tuesday on the first leg of a five-nation, 10-day tour of Latin America. 
 Although Hashimoto made no comments to reporters upon his arrival at the Mexico City airport just before 11:30 a.m. EDT (1530 GMT), he was expected to announce credits to Mexico worth $940 million during his three-day trip, Mexican officials said. 
 Deputy Foreign Minister Juan Rebolledo Gout said on Monday that the credits -- aimed at ecological projects, small- and medium-sized firms and Mexican exporters -- would be signed by Mexican and Japanese officials on Wednesday. 
 The support comes as Hashimoto seeks to open a new trade front for Japanese industry in Latin America. Tokyo has already pumped nearly $60 billion in direct investment into the region over the past 14 years and its economic aid doubled between 1990 and 1995 to $1.14 billion. 
 Hashimoto will hold talks with President Ernesto Zedillo on Wednesday and will meet members of the Japanese-Mexican community during his stay. 
 Mexico was the first stop on a trip that will also take him to Chile, Brazil, Peru and Costa Rica. 
 A potential cloud over his trip was lifted on Monday when kidnappers released a top Japanese electronics executive in the Mexican-U.S. border city of Tijuana after a $2 million ransom was paid. 
 After nine days in captivity, Mamoru Konno, president of a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Sanyo Electric Co was found in the basement of an unoccupied building after a Mexican police official contacted kidnappers with the money.

 UK: Lloyd's chief undergoes U.S. grilling. 
 Lloyd's chief undergoes U.S. grilling. 
 Christopher Adams 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Lloyd's of London chief executive Ron Sandler on Tuesday faced a three-hour grilling in a crucial United States court case, which threatens at the last minute to upset a recovery plan for the 300-year-old insurance market. 
 Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case in Virginia, where U.S. investors (Names) have applied for an injunction to stop the recovery plan in its tracks. 
 The investors, known as Names, contend that Lloyd's has contravened U.S. disclosure laws. Sandler is fighting the action personally and underwent several hours of cross-examination on Monday, said Lloyd's. 
 On Tuesday, he said the recovery plan was essential to the future of Lloyd's. Under the proposals, Lloyd's is to reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities, including pollution and asbestosis claims in the U.S., into a new company Equitas. 
 Lloyd's has for several years faced a giant raft of litigation in the U.S., but the timing of this latest challenge so near the August 28 deadline, by which Names must accept or reject the recovery plan, has caused it a serious headache. 
 Judge Robert Payne in Monday's sitting criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws. 
 The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the SEC's neutral position on this issue. Payne said the SEC would have a second opportunity to respond to his request for a ruling. 
 Early on Tuesday morning, however, Lloyd's received a boost from a separate court case in New York, which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names. They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names. 
 "We are pleased by this decision. Names entered into their commitments under UK law and we are pleased that U.S. courts continue to recognise this," said Lloyd's U.S. boss Peter Lane. 
 In Britain, meanwhile, support among Names for the recovery plan has grown since Lloyd's improved its proposals, which include a 3.2 billion pounds ($4.95 billion) offer to Names designed to offset the cost of Equitas. 
 A last ditch attempt at securing more favourable treatment by a British-based action group foundered last week, when the High Court threw out a case for judicial review of the plan. 
 But a former Name heading an action group of loss-making investors, on Tuesday hit out at Lloyd's for "breaking promises" he says were made to the hardest-hit Names. 
 The outspoken chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party and the deputy leader of the Lloyd's Defence Shield, Christopher Stockwell, ended weeks of silence with the charge Lloyd's has "reneged" on income and housing pledges. 
 Stockwell said the scheme was entirely dependent on the availability of future funds. This meant Lloyd's could end the scheme any time, which amounted to no formal commitment. 
 He also claimed fewer than 20 percent of Names have so far accepted the recovery plan. Lloyd's rejected both statements. 
 The market last week published guidelines for helping those Names who were worst off after accepting its recovery plan.

 GERMANY: German unions split on tactics in retail pay talks. 
 German unions split on tactics in retail pay talks. 
 Catherine O'Mahony 
 FRANKFURT 1996-08-20 
 
 The two main unions representing German retail workers split apart on Tuesday. The HBV union pulled out of talks in a four-month old pay dispute while the DAG opted to continue negotiations. 
 The unions have been jointly negotiating a wage and work hours deal for the 450,000 retail workers in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, one of several regional deals being hammered out in advance of November's liberalisation of shop hours. 
 However the service sector union HBV pulled out of the talks on Tuesday after employers refused to accept its unexpected demand for extra compensation for night work. 
 Until now, unions have pressed for broad adoption of a deal struck in Rhineland-Palatinate which called for workers to get a 1.85 percent wage rise plus 20 percent extra time in lieu per hour worked after 6:30 p.m. weekdays and 2:00 p.m. Saturdays. 
 The white collar DAG, which immediately distanced itself from the HBV's demands, said it was confident it could reach an agreement with shopowners on the Rhineland-Palatinate model and would continue talks. 
 Early Tuesday evening, employers and unions said the talks were progressing well. 
 The HBV, however, is insisting that shopowners pay all workers a 55 percent bonus time in lieu for time worked between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. The retail industry currently pays such bonuses only to truck drivers and store-room workers. 
 HBV negotiator Gerhard Keuchel said his union would try over the coming days to find fresh ground for new talks, but said the 55 percent bonus was essential. 
 Meanwhile the HDE retail industry association pleaded for a swift end to the deadlock on the talks, which has caused four months of sporadic strike action affecting shops and wholesalers throughout Germany. 
 "This cannot drag on until the start of November," HDE wages expert Guenther Wassmann told German radio. 
 So far, employers, hit by weak consumer spending, have baulked at accepting the Rhineland-Palatinate deal and took particular issue with the 20 percent allowance demand. 
 However in Bavaria, DAG officials said they were confident of a positive outcome from the tenth round of their wage negotiations, which begins on Wednesday. 
 The DAG suspended token strikes ahead of the talks and said it planned to suggest a compromise on the controversial 20 percent allowance. 
 However it warned that the token strikes would resume if employers declined the offer. 
 In Berlin, wage talks resumed on Tuesday morning for the region's 87,500 retail workers. Union representatives said they planned to seek an overall pay rise of five percent, to be applicable in east German states as well, in addition to the shop hours deal.

 British FTSE index closes at record 3,883 points. 
 LONDON 
 
 Britain's FTSE 100 stock index, which sank to its lowest level of the year a month ago, chalked up a record closing high Tuesday, led by retail stocks. 
 "You probably couldn't have forecast a better background for the equity market than the one we've currently got," said one stock trader. "The market has a lot going for it." 
 The blue chip index closed 19.5 points higher at 3,883.2, surpassing the previous 3,872.9 record it set just last week. 
 Gainers outweighed decliners by a margin of two to one but volume was a subdued 512.9 million shares as all eyes remained fixed on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Markets Committee, which was meeting as the London market closed. 
 Retail stocks which led an early advance were boosted by the latest economic figures which showed an improvement in British consumer sentiment. 
 "The consumer credit figures this morning showed another booming month -- the consumer is back with a vengeance," another trader said. 
 But the return of the so-called "feel-good factor" in the retail sector may also reduce the likelihood of any further cuts in British interest rates, traders said.

 UK: Trocadero expects tripling of revenues. 
 Trocadero expects tripling of revenues. 
 Leslie Adler 
 LONDON 
 
 The Trocadero entertainment complex in the heart of London's Piccadilly marked its relaunch on Tuesday after a 50 million pound ($77 million) redevelopment that it said was expected to triple revenues over five years. 
 "An estimated 55 million visitors a year pass by the Trocadero and some 20 million people come through the centre," Nick Leslau, chief executive of Trocadero Plc, told a news conference. 
 The challenge, he said, was to convert visitors into money-spending consumers. 
 Leslau said he expected the retail revenues to triple over the next five years, the time span in which he expects the centre to reach maturity. 
 He said Trocadero would seek to convert rental agreements into revenue-sharing deals as leases expire. 
 Trocadero and Japan's Sega together invested about $77 million in redesigning the centre -- shifting its focus from shopping to entertainment and giving it a flashy, high-tech look -- and installing a SegaWorld virtual reality centre due to open next month. 
 An Imax 3D cinema is to open in early 1997. 
 The complex's current entertainment and shopping tenants -- including cinemas, an amusement arcade and a Planet Hollywood restaurant as well as shops -- generate retail revenues of about 125 million pounds ($192 million) a year, Leslau said. Trocadero derives its revenues from the rental income it receives from these tenants. 
 It recently entered into a joint venture for a Marvel Mania themed restaurant to be built adjacent to the Trocadero. The Marvel Mania restaurant, based on characters from Marvel comics, is a joint venture with Robert Earl's Planet Hollywood and Ronald Perelman's Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. 
 Trocadero's current rental deals provide guaranteed income that is sufficient to cover the complex's service debt and overhead for the next 22 years, Leslau said. 
 Trocadero Plc was spun off from property management group Burford Holdings last November. Burford had acquired the Trocadero complex in September 1994 for 94 million pounds ($145 million). At that time the Trocadero was a shopping mall. 
 "The key to success at the Trocadero lay in its transformation from a shopping mall into a premier entertainment destination," Leslau added.

 GERMANY: Viag stays positive after first half profit slump. 
 Viag stays positive after first half profit slump. 
 Catherine O'Mahony 
 FRANKFURT 1996-08-20 
 
 German utility group Viag AG on Tuesday said its net profit this year ought to at least match 1995's 1.32 billion marks ($886.1 million) despite a 21 percent slide in its earnings in first-half 1996. 
 The diversified group said its pre-tax profit slumped to 1.178 billion marks in the first six months of 1996, but chairman Georg Obermeier stressed that the comparative 1995 figure was swollen by one-off gains from selling off units. 
 Speaking to a news conference, Obermeier said operating profit had risen 10 percent in the six-month period, but declined to give absolute figures. 
 He also noted that the bulk of Viag's first-half profit in 1995 was the result of one-off gains from the sale of its 43.4 percent stake in Germany's biggest paper maker PWA and the final consolidaton of its SKW Trostberg unit. 
 "Overall the Viag group is developing in line with ... expectations. The economic weakness of the winter period had an effect on the cyclical divisions, however growth tendencies are evident again in several areas," Viag said. 
 Viag also said its group sales expanded by two percent to 21.803 billion marks from 21.375 billion in the first half of 1996. 
 The group said sales growth was varied across different divisions, with strong gains in its energy units, in its SKW unit's natural fibres division, drinks packaging at its Schmalbach-Lubeca unit and at Computer 2000. 
 However turnover in aluminium business at its VAW unit and steel trading at its Kloeckner unit had come under strong pressure, Viag said. 
 Overall packaging sales dropped to 5.9 billion marks from 6.3 billion marks, while the other core business segments -- energy, chemicals and logistics -- posted sales growth. 
 Viag said it would continue to expand its core business areas and proceed with a range of restructuring and cost-cutting measures. 
 Group investment in fixed assets dropped to 792 million marks from 913 million marks in the first half of 1996 while group spending on participations dropped dramatically to 178 million marks from 1.49 billion. 
 In the first half of 1995, Viag and its units bought several major companies including SBI Systems Bio-Industries, bought by Viag's chemicals division and a majority stake in Computer 2000. 
 Viag's workforce was little changed at 82,874 compared with 84,939 in the first six months of 1995.

 GERMANY: Rangebound German shares end mixed, utilities up. 
 Rangebound German shares end mixed, utilities up. 
 FRANKFURT 1996-08-20 
 
 German shares were rangebound in bourse trade on Tuesday, with the highlight of the day a shifting of interest from the chemical sector into utility stocks. 
 The 30-share DAX ended the day down 2.50 points at 2,560.26 points after sticking in a seven-point range. The IBIS-DAX, tracking electronic trading during the day, closed slightly better at 2,562.12 points. 
 The big three chemical groups took the biggest battering, while utility shares benefited from interest partly generated by Viag AG's forthcoming six month earnings report. After the close of the electronic bourse trading Viag reported operating profit up 10 percent during the first half of this year. 
 The broader market was lacklustre, dealers said, and shrugged off a Bundesbank report showing slower July M3 growth, which is viewed as boosting the case for the central bank to cut the securities repurchase rate, or repo, on Thursday. 
 Chemicals were sold to make way for utilities. In IBIS trading Hoechst lost 31 pfennigs to 50.80 marks, Bayer declined by 5 pfennigs to 52.35 marks while utility Viag rose 6.75 to 569.75. 
 Utilities have been underperforming during the last two months, but are bottoming out now, traders said. 
 "The upswing in utilities stocks is an answer to the recent weakness of those shares", one dealer said. 
 Dealers said the moderate M3 growth was in line with expectations and thus failed to generate momentum for the stock market. 
 However the market will continue to look for guidance on the interest rate front ahead of the Bundesbank meeting Thursday, dealers said. 
 The result of the FOMC meeting in the U.S. due early in the European evening was expected to provide further clues.

 Fleet, NatWest form pact.

 Fleet Financial Group and National Westminster Bank PLC said Tuesday they signed an agreement that will allow both companies to provide banking services to corporate customers in Britain and the United States. 
 Under the agreement, NatWest will set up a representative office in Boston to provide Sterling and foreign currency account and cash management services to American companies that either have a physical presence in Britain or trade there. 
 Desks also will be created in Boston, New York and London, where each bank's customers can receive quick help in opening accounts and cash management. The offices will be staffed by employees who will bring specific expertise in their country's banking system to each marketplace, the companies said. 
 Fleet will provide U.S. dollar accounts and cash management services to the U.S. subsidiaries and offices of British-based companies. Fleet currently markets U.S. cash management services directly to British companies from its office in London. 
 NatWest supplies commercial banking services to about one-third of the companies in Britain and is the second largest retail bank in the country with over 2,000 branches.

 UK: Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher. 
 Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Silver prices were at their highest levels since mid-June on Tuesday after speculative buying sent the New York market surging overnight, dealers said. 
 Gold followed only reluctantly, but market analysts said it could eventually make a go of breaking through its recent price ceiling at just under $390 an ounce. 
 Silver closed at $5.23 an ounce, up eleven cents from Monday's London close. It fixed at just over $5.20 an ounce, the highest fixing since June 19. 
 Silver eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight. 
 But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week. "It's a purely technical move, but I can see it going for $5.30 this week," one said. 
 Technical analysts or chartists who follow detailed charts of past prices said that the rally needed to clear the $5.25 resistance level before pushing higher. 
 Silver have been trending lower since peaking at a fix of around $5.83 in early February. 
 "Silver is not out of the woods yet," said analyst Cliff Green of Trend Analysis. "But getting up past that $5.15-45.16 area is a positive step." 
 In contrast, bullion closed just $0.90 higher at $387.55 an ounce, virtually ignoring silver's newfound strength. 
 "Gold has had a bit of a dismal performance. The move seems to be just in silver," one dealer said. 
 But some chartists said gold has scope to move higher. 
 "Obviously much depends on gold's ability to clear the critical resistance immediately below $390," said analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge. 
 "But silver's recovery following what is looking to be a false breakdown earlier below $5.00 adds to the evidence this may occur," she added. 
 Some analysts said gold was being cautious while waiting for the outcome of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in New York in case of surprises on interest rates. 
 Another dampener was a slump in the South African rand, which was seen encouraging selling by South African producers. 
 Palladium closed at $125.60, up $0.95 and off recent 2-1/2 year lows, while platinum ended $1.40 higher at $399.80.

 JAPAN: Mazda's new ad campaign sports unlikely celebrity. 
 Mazda's new ad campaign sports unlikely celebrity. 
 TOKYO 
 
 Mazda Motor Corp. is using a foreign celebrity -- its own president -- to revamp its image in Japan. 
 Company President Henry Wallace, a famous figure in Japan as the first foreigner to head a major Japanese firm, is to star in Mazda's new advertising campaign. 
 The 50-year-old Wallace will appear in full-page advertisments in five major Japanese newspapers Thursday. 
 Mazda broke with tradition by putting a foreigner in the driver's seat and is doing so again with its new sales promotion. It is rare for a Japanese company to use photos of its top management in a campaign to sell its merchandise. 
 The ads will have a full picture of Wallace standing to the left and his comments about the company on the right. 
 Wallace has become a celebrity in Japan after being appointed president at Mazda, Japan's fifth-largest carmaker, in June. 
 Sent over by Ford Motor Co. several years ago to help turn around the troubled Japanese automaker, Wallace was given the top spot when Ford increased its equity stake in the company to about one-third. 
 Wallace comes originally from Edinburgh, Scotland, and has been employed by Ford for 25 years. He first joined Ford's British operation. 
 Mazda decided to use Wallace in its ads as the result of a survey showing that Japanese found him likeable and impressive, the spokesman said. 
 The company has been struggling with poor demand for most of its cars and has been in the red on a group net basis for the past three years. The losses were the result of a number of errors in assessing the market, analysts say. 
 Mazda is hoping a straight-forward approach in its ad will distinguish it from its rivals and capture the attention of consumers. 
 The ads displaying Wallace will carry the slogan "Practical car, Enjoyable car, That's Mazda." 
 The ad will be promoting its new compact recreational vehicle, the Demio, which will debut in Japan next week. Compact recreational vehicles are one of the hottest selling models for all Japanese automakers. 
 Mazda has had a relationship with Ford for many years. In May, Ford raised its stake in Mazda to 33.4 percent from 25 percent -- which gave it control of the management. 
 Ford sent Wallace to Japan to represent its interests in Mazda two years ago. 
 "If successful, Wallace may continue appearing in Mazda's future ads," the company spokesman said.

 UK: British money growth slows, back in monitoring range. 
 British money growth slows, back in monitoring range. 
 LONDON 
 
 Growth in Britain's M4 money supply slowed to 8.8 percent in the first half of the year, the Bank of England said Tuesday, while lending by banks and building societies continued to increase. 
 The slowdown in money supply growth from annual rates of 10 percent in May and June brought the figure back within the government's monitoring range of 3 percent to 9 percent for the first time since November. 
 Some economists said it could suggest a softening in future inflationary pressures. 
 However, the British Bankers' Association said a strong 539 million pound ($833 million) increase in consumer credit in July could point to a strengthening of consumer spending. 
 "The strength of consumer credit and housing market activity within the lending figures will be seized upon by the Bank of England as a potential threat to the inflation target," said Andrew Cates, an economist at UBS. 
 Seasonally adjusted M4 -- a broad measure of money supply which comprises cash in circulation, personal and commercial bank deposits and certificates of deposit -- grew 0.4 percent in July from June, down from 0.7 percent in June. 
 Strong money supply growth is often seen as a pointer to future inflation and central bank Governor Eddie George has warned that interest rates might have to rise if it continued unchecked. 
 However, its reliability has been thrown into question this year because of special distorting factors, such as a rash of corporate mergers and acquisitions. 
 The slowdown will, therefore, offer little new ammunition to Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Kenneth Clarke if he wants to cut interest rates this fall. 
 Clarke has cut rates four times since last December to their current 5.75 percent level, overruling the Bank of England on the last occasion in June.

 JAPAN: Japan adds game machines to inflation gauge. 
 Japan adds game machines to inflation gauge. 
 TOKYO 
 
 Japan said Tuesday that game machines, tickets to soccer matches and imported rice will replace traditional socks worn with the kimono and corned beef as items used to measure the nation's price movements. 
 New items also include golf fees and delivered pizza. 
 In a move underlining changes in consumer tastes, the government announced it was revising the selection of goods it uses to track price trends to include more up-to-date items. 
 "We are adding 37 items to a basket of goods purchased by households to better measure recent price moves," said an official of the government's Management and Coordination Agency. 
 The agency updates the components and changes the base year for Japan's consumer price index every five years. 
 The new CPI will cover 580 items after dropping goods like harmonicas, which Japanese children learn to play in school, and a pressed-fish sausage eaten as a snack. 
 With many consumer items now sold at discount stores in recent years, analysts question if the new basket can still detect price movements accurately. 
 "It is very important to see whether they will put a greater weighting on discount stores in their analysis," said Russell Jones, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. 
 "We are not ignoring prices at discount stores, but we cannot say how many items sold discounted are analysed," the agency official said. 
 The agency said prices have almost stopped dropping after several years of decline during the prolonged recession that followed the collapse of the 1980s "bubble" economy. 
 CPI figures are issued every month.

 Orange telecom group loss grows but says future bright. 
 LONDON 
 
 British mobile telephone group Orange Plc said Tuesday its pre-tax losses expanded by 40 percent to 125.2 million pounds ($193.6 million) in the first half of the year, although its subscriber base and revenues both grew. 
 Orange, whose shares have fallen well below the level at which they were offered to the public in March, said the loss was expected and pointed to steady gains in its subscribers and revenue as proof of the underlying health of the business. 
 "Our net growth has increased dramatically ... All the key drivers of the business, we are succeeding on," Managing Director Hans Snook said in an interview. 
 Shares in Orange gained 4 pence (6.2 cents) to 191 ($2.95) after the results, which compared with a loss of 88.8 million ($137.3 million) a year earlier. 
 But the stock is still well short of the 205 pence ($3.17) level of its flotation, which valued the group at some 2.5 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) and propelled it into the FTSE-100 index of leading British shares. 
 Orange said its revenue more than doubled to 256.5 million pounds ($396.7 million) from 100 million pounds (154.7 million) as it added a further 194,000 subscribers to take its total customer base to 573,000.

 Thistle Hotels almost doubles profits. 
 LONDON 
 
 Thistle Hotels, Britain's second biggest hotel chain, said Tuesday its pre-tax profits almost doubled in the first half of the year. 
 The company, which plans an initial public offering of stock in September, said its net income, excluding exceptional items, expanded to 24.1 million pounds ($37.2 million). 
 However, profits were hit by a one-time charge of 87.8 million pounds ($135.5 million) to partly account for a 10 percent cut in the valuation of its hotel portfolio to 1.7 billion pounds ($2.6 billion). 
 Thistle owns some 100 hotels, including such luxury names as London's Grosvenor and Royal Horseguards hotels. 
 Market watchers say its initial public offering could value the group at between one billion and 1.5 billion pounds ($1.5 billion and $2.3 billion). 
 Thistle plans to raise 250 million pounds ($386 million) in cash through the offer. About 100 million to 150 million pounds ($155 to $232 million) would be used to reduce debt, with the remaining being invested in expanding room capacity, Chief Executive Robert Peel said. 
 "We would focus the money on London -- the region where we get the best returns," he said in an interview. 
 Thistle said a price range would be announced at the time of the stock offering, which has no fixed date so far.

 FRANKFURT 1996-08-20 
 
 Talks between German retail workers' unions and shopowners aimed at resolving a four-month old pay dispute hit a further stumbling block on Tuesday, despite union optimism that a settlement could be reached. 
 Ulrich Walter, chief negotiator for shopowners in North Rhine-Westphalia, said an unexpected union demand for night-time bonuses for the region's 450,000 retail workers had made agreement impossible in Tuesday's talks. 
 Unions and employers in several federal states are resuming talks this week to agree a wage and work hours deal to cope with the liberalisation of German shopping hours in November. 
 Until now, unions have pressed for broad adoption of a deal struck in Rhineland-Palatinate which called for workers to get a 1.85 percent wage rise plus 20 percent extra time in lieu per hour worked after 6:30 p.m. weekdays and 2:00 p.m. Saturdays. 
 However the HBV services union on Tuesday called for a 55 percent bonus time in lieu for shifts between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. The retail industry currently pays such bonuses only to truck drivers and store-room workers. 
 The white-collar DAG union distanced itself from the demand. 
 Earlier HBV's chief negotiator for North Rhine-Westphalia, Gerhard Keuchel, said there were "strong chances" for agreement during Tuesday's talks, which took place in the town of Marl. 
 The HDE retail industry association also pleaded for a swift end to the deadlock on the talks, which has caused four months of sporadic strike action affecting shops and wholesalers throughout Germany.

 However, the society said its share of Britain's reviving housing market slipped to a 7.2 percent share of net mortage lending and 15.2 percent of gross mortgage lending. 
 Spokesman Gary Marsh said in an interview that these levels were below the firm's normal market share of about 20 percent because it had shied away from re-mortgaging, which accounted for 30 percent of the total mortgage market. 
 The size of the re-mortgage market reflects the low level of transactions from home buyers, Marsh said. 
 One analyst said the slip reflected the society's pursuit of profits as it prepared for a public stock offering.

 UK: Lloyd's braces for crucial U.S. court case ruling. 
 Lloyd's braces for crucial U.S. court case ruling. 
 Christopher Adams 
 LONDON 
 
 Lloyd's of London Tuesday braced for a possible ruling in a crucial United States court case that threatens at the last minute to upset a recovery plan for the 300-year-old insurance market. 
 Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case in Richmond, Va., where U.S. investors, known as Names, have applied for an injunction to block the recovery plan. 
 Under its rescue proposals, Lloyd's is to reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities, including pollution and asbestos-related claims in the United States, into a new company called Equitas. 
 Names have only eight days left in which to accept or reject this plan, on which the future of the market hangs. 
 Since improving the terms of the proposals, which include a 3.2 billion pound ($4.95 billion) offer to Names designed to offset the cost of Equitas, support among British Names for the plan has grown. 
 A last-ditch attempt at securing more favourable treatment by a British-based action group floundered last week when the High Court threw out a case for judicial review of the plan. 
 But in the United States, Lloyd's has for several years faced a raft of litigation. This latest challenge by 100 American Names contends that Lloyd's has breached U.S. disclosure laws. 
 The insurance market's chief executive, Ron Sandler, is fighting the action personally. He was cross-examined Monday. 
 Judge Robert Payne criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws. 
 The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the SEC's neutral position on this issue. Payne said the SEC would have a second opportunity to respond to his request for a ruling. 
 Early Tuesday morning, however, Lloyd's received a boost from a separate court case in New York, which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names. They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names. 
 "We are pleased by this decision. Names entered into their commitments under UK law and we are pleased that U.S. courts continue to recognise this," said Lloyd's U.S. boss Peter Lane. 
 The market last week published guidelines for helping those Names who were worst off after accepting its recovery plan.

 USA: U.S. farm trade surplus $1.741 billion in June. 
 U.S. farm trade surplus $1.741 billion in June. 
 WASHINGTON 
 
 The U.S. trade surplus in agricultural commodities was $1.741 billion in June, down from a revised $1.879 billion in May, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. 
 In its monthly trade report, Commerce pegged farm exports at $4.276 billion in June, down from $4.723 billion in May. Imports were $2.535 billion, compared with $2.844 billion the previous month. 
 The cumulative surplus in farm trade was $13.667 billion in the first six months of the year, compared with $11.400 billion in the same period last year. 
 In June, the value of U.S. corn exports fell to $640 million from $885 million in May, and wheat exports fell to $448 million from $475 million. Soybean exports rose to $430 million from $352 million, the department said. 
 Imports of vegetable oils and fats fell in June to $110 million from $157 million in May.

 USA: Fed seen holding U.S. interest rates steady. 
 Fed seen holding U.S. interest rates steady. 
 Caren Bohan 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 The U.S. Federal Reserve met on Tuesday to discuss the future course of interest rates and was widely expected to keep rates steady amid mixed signals on the economy. 
 "The speeches made by various Fed governors and by bank presidents recently are not pointing toward tightening," said Preston Martin, chairman of HomeVest Financial Services Inc. in San Francisco. 
 "I would think the odds are very heavily weighted toward the prospect that there will be no change at the next policy-making meeting," said Martin, a former Fed vice chairman. 
 The central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) started meeting at 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT). If past practice is followed, any decision should be announced around 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT). 
 Martin's forecast was shared unanimously by the 30 economists polled last week by Reuters, although some of those experts did not rule out a rate rise later this year. 
 Financial markets marked time Tuesday morning as they awaited the outcome of the central bank meeting, with bond and stock prices little changed. 
 The Fed meeting takes place at a time when questions abound about whether the economy is beginning to cool off after growing at a fast clip in the second quarter. 
 Until just a few weeks ago, many economists believed the economy was growing quickly enough to require an interest-rate rise by the Fed to slow it down and prevent inflation. However, a series of recent reports containing early signs of a slowdown changed those views. 
 The latest came on Tuesday, with news that the U.S. trade deficit fell by more than 20 percent in June as imports plunged. Analysts said the steep drop in imports pointed to slackening domestic demand and a slowing U.S. economy. 
 "We had data very recently showing the housing market is starting to fade and the inflation reports were good," said Joel Prakken, chairman at the St. Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisors LLC. 
 "All of that suggests we are seeing a slowdown from the second quarter and that the Fed does not need to move," he added. 
 Some experts, however, said the economic signs were inconclusive and did not rule out a rate rise later this year. 
 Any rate increase would represent a reversal in the Fed's monetary policy. The previous rate change was in January, the last of a series of credit easings undertaken when the economy appeared soft. The economy has rebounded strongly since then. 
 The federal funds rate, which commercial banks charge each other for overnight cash, is now at 5.25 percent. The funds rate is controlled by the Fed and acts as a benchmark for other short-term interest rates. 
 The discount rate, which the Fed charges member banks for loans, stands at 5 percent.

 AUSTRALIA: Australian dollar, bonds retreat from budget. 
 Australian dollar, bonds retreat from budget. 
 Colin Brinsden 
 SYDNEY 1996-08-20 
 
 The Australian dollar and bonds both went into quick retreat on Tuesday amid mild disappointment that the maiden budget of Australia's conservative government was not as tough as the markets had been led to believe. 
 Within an hour of the budget being announced on Tuesday night the dollar had sunk to US$0.7860/0.7865 from a pre-budget US$0.7883/88, while long dated bond yields rose some eight basis points taking the November 2006 bond back up to 8.0 percent. 
 "It wasn't a complete disappointment, but this is the first of supposedly extremely tough budgets and it doesn't quite live up to expectations," said UBS chief economist Stephen Roberts. 
 The treasurer announced an underlying budget deficit of A$5.65 billion (US$4.46 billion) and a headline budget surplus of A$474 million for 1996/97 after savings of A$3.9 billion. 
 Median forecasts had centred on an underlying deficit of A$4.9 billion and a headline surplus of A$1.0 billion. 
 A total borrowing requirement of A$7.0 billion for 1996/97 was also larger than some analysts had expected. 
 The local bond market had rallied strongly in recent days in anticipation of a fiscal squeeze in the first conservative government budget in 14 years. It had been looking for cuts of over A$4.0 billion to maintain the momentum that had taken yields to their lowest level since March 1994. 
 The local dollar also lost its gloss after advancing to a three-week high of US$0.7933 at the start of the day amid repeated comments by the five-month-old government that the budget would pave the way for further cuts in interest rates. 
 "If we can get our budget, intact, through the Senate, if we can get that low inflation locked in, then I think we can set up the chances for an easing in monetary policy," Costello said. 
 The dollar had slid to US$0.7700 after last month's surprise 50 basis points cut in official interest rates to 7.0 percent as it eroded the currency's yield advantage, and there are fears that a further reduction could see it fall to US$0.7600. 
 "The next hurdle is going to be the passage of the budget through the Senate," said Bruce Freeland, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. "Difficulties in passing the budget have previously led to downward pressure on the Australian dollar and higher bond yields." 
 However, he added that recent statements by the minor parties in the Senate would seem to reduce the probability of the budget being blocked in the upper house. 
 The budget also painted a rosy outlook for the economy with growth forecast to average 3.5 percent over 1996/97 and underlying inflation at 2.75 percent. 
 "It is probably mildly bearish for the markets because it was such a favourable economic outlook, rather than any failure on the fiscal tightening...," said Stephen Koukoulas, senior economist at Citibank Australia. (A$1 = US$0.79)

 GERMANY: Wella first-half profits up sharply. 
 Wella first-half profits up sharply. 
 DARMSTADT, Germany 
 
 Wella AG, the German haircare group, Tuesday reported healthy growth in sales and earnings in the first six months as new product launches helped it outperform the rest of the industry. 
 Operating profit rose 25 percent to 61 million marks ($40.95 million), while sales expanded 11.3 percent to 1.82 billion marks ($1.22 billion), the company said in its interim report. 
 It predicted full-year sales would rise by 7-10 percent and said earnings growth was likely to be stronger. 
 "We are anticipating a continuation of the positive business development in the second half of 1996," Wella said. 
 But the news failed to give buoyancy to Wella's shares. The ordinary shares closed down nine marks ($6) or 1 percent at 888 marks ($596.17). Preference shares closed little changed at 900 marks ($604.23), down 0.10 marks (6.7 cents), after recovering from a day's low of 885 ($594.16). 
 Pre-tax profit fell to 61 million marks ($41 million) from 83 million marks ($55.7 million) in the year-earlier period, when Wella had a one-time gain of 35 million marks ($23.5 million) from the dissolution of provisions no longer required. 
 The first-half operating earnings growth marks a turnaround from 1995 when net profit slumped 41 percent to 74.2 million marks ($49.8 million) amid adverse currency movements and operational problems. 
 Wella in April predicted net profit would rebound 25 percent in 1995. 
 The sales rise of 11.3 percent outstripped market growth of less than 3 percent, Wella said. Wella also said it achieved an increase of 7.9 percent in sales to hairdressers despite a stagnating hairdressing market. 
 Sales of haircare products to retailers jumped 21.3 percent, well above expectations, Wella said. "Our new product concepts have been very well received worldwide," it said. 
 Sales of scents and cosmetics rose 12.4 percent in the first half due to successful product launches. 
 Domestic sales were 574 million marks ($385.4 million) versus 533 million ($357.8 million), while sales abroad rose to 1.24 billion marks ($832.5 million) from 1.1 billion ($738.5 million). 
 A Wella spokesman said the improvement in the first six months was due in part to Wella's foreign subsidiaries which managed to recover from losses posted last year in China, Russia and Britain. 
 German subsidiaries like Muelhens, the maker of the 4711 Eau de Cologne, improved sharply while Wella's core domestic business did not perform as well, the spokesman said. 
 That is reflected in figures for the parent company which reported its sales trimmed by 5.3 percent to 415 million marks ($278.6 million) while pre-tax profit was unchanged at 33 million marks ($22.2 million).

 USA: U.S. June trade gap narrows sharply as imports drop. 
 U.S. June trade gap narrows sharply as imports drop. 
 Glenn Somerville 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 The U.S. trade gap narrowed dramatically in June as imports of merchandise and petroleum plunged from May levels, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. 
 The monthly deficit dropped 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion from a revised $10.55 billion in May -- much lower than the $9.4 billion shortfall that Wall Street economists had forecast for June. 
 June exports eased a slight 0.3 percent to $69.71 billion while imports dropped 3.3 percent to $77.82 billion. 
 Amid the big overall improvement in June trade, China emerged for the first time as the nation with which the United States has the largest bilateral shortfall. 
 The deficit with China climbed 8.8 percent to $3.33 billion in June, surpassing the $3.24 billion deficit with Japan that was up 3.6 percent from May. 
 Commerce noted that exports of American-made goods to China declined for a fourth straight month in June, which is likely to fuel trade tensions between the two countries. 
 Steady improvement in shrinking the deficit with Japan was the main reason that China became the leading deficit nation in June, Commerce officials said. The second-quarter deficit of $10.5 billion with Japan was the smallest quarterly deficit in five years, the department said. 
 Previously, the department said the overall May trade deficit was $10.88 billion but it revised that down to a $10.55 billion gap. 
 The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits. 
 In June, the merchandise deficit fell 13.9 percent to $14.46 billion from $16.79 billion in May. Lower imports of new cars and parts, especially from Japan and Germany, helped shrink the merchandise trade gap. 
 The surplus on services climbed 1.6 percent to $6.34 billion from $6.25 billion in May. Analysts said beforehand that an influx of tourists bound for the Olympic Games in Atlanta would boost the services surplus. 
 The cost and volume of all types of petroleum products fell in June after a sharp May runup. The cost of petroleum imports declined to $5.33 billion in June from $5.93 billion while the volume fell to 291,866 barrels from 305,171 in May. 
 Foreign sales of civilian aircraft declined in June by $117 million to $1.54 billion. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were off $138 million to $12.32 billion. 
 Imports of autos and parts from all sources dropped sharply by $689 million to $10.79 billion in June. Computer imports were down $413 million to $4.24 billion and semiconductor imports decreased $291 million to $2.87 billion in June. 
 In bilateral trade, the deficit with Western Europe fell 7.1 percent to $761 million and the shortfall with Canada was down 2.2 percent to $2.42 billion. 
 In trade with Mexico, the U.S. deficit shrank 6.4 percent to $1.49 billion amid signs the Mexican economy was recovering from a deep recession and grew solidly in the second quarter this year. 
 The deficit with oil-producing OPEC countries dropped 26.9 percent in June to $1.40 billion from $1.91 billion in May.

 TAIWAN: Taiwan cautious on China direct shipping rules. 
 Taiwan cautious on China direct shipping rules. 
 Alice Hung 
 TAIPEI 1996-08-20 
 
 Taipei gave a positive but cautious response to China's release on Tuesday of rules governing direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait, even though such links are still banned by Taiwan. 
 "Of course we are happy to see it accomplished, but would prefer to comment after we have more details," said an official with the island's Ministry of Transportation and Communications. 
 The island's top agency for China policymaking, the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, gave a cooler response, saying Beijing's rules were belated and "mingled with sensitive political issues". 
 The regulations, effective from Tuesday, allow only wholly Chinese-owned or Taiwan-owned shipping companies or joint ventures involving Chinese or Taiwanese shipowners to sail between the two sides, Beijing's Xinhua news agency said. 
 "The regulations...are meant to promote cargo and passenger transport between the two sides of the Straits and accelerate the development of direct mail service, trade, and air and shipping links across the Straits," Xinhua said. 
 Hong Kong's Beijing-backed Wen Wei Po daily said China's southeastern ports at Xiamen and Fuzhou would be the first to be opened to direct shipping links with Taiwan. 
 "The conditions for (establishing) direct shipping links are ripe," the newspaper said. 
 Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council urged Beijing to be practical and remove barriers that have prevented direct links. 
 "...The mainland's direct links plan is still mingled with sensitive political issues," it said. "We hope the mainland side can adopt a practical attitude to remove obstacles blocking links across the strait." It did not elaborate. 
 Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists lost the civil war to the Chinese communists and fled to the island in 1949. 
 China views Taiwan as a renegade province. 
 With tensions easing since the late 1980s, civilian aircraft and vessels have skirted the ban by stopping over in Hong Kong, Macau or other third countries. 
 To fulfil its ambition of becoming an Asia-Pacific business hub, Taiwan proposed in 1995 to set up an offshore transshipment centre at southern Kaohsiung port from which ships would be allowed to sail directly between Taiwan and China. 
 The project has been delayed by sovereignty issues, with squabbling over Chinese and Taiwanese flags and documents that would bear the names and marks from both governments and might be interpreted by either side as reciprocal recognition. 
 "It (Beijing's plan) is similar to our offshore transshipment centre plan," transport ministry spokesman Hsu Chieh-kuei said on state television. 
 "It will be good if we can find a way to resolve the sea links problem across the Taiwan Strait," Hsu said. "We will carefully study the counterproposals." 
 Taiwan investors, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, have pressured the government to establish such links to save transportation costs. 
 "This is a breakthrough," Taiwan global shipping giant Evergreen Marine Corp said in a statement. "The company welcomes the decision from the business point of view."

 UK: FOCUS-BSkyB profits surge 66 percent. 
 FOCUS-BSkyB profits surge 66 percent. 
 Keith Weir 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Satellite broadcaster BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay television, on Tuesday reported a 66 percent rise in full-year profit to 257.4 million pounds ($398.1 million). 
 Annual turnover climbed to more than one billion pounds as the number of subscribers in Britain and Ireland rose to 5.5 million for BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake. 
 Profit for the year to June 30, 1996 -- up more than 100 million pounds on the 155.3 million reported a year ago -- was towards the top end of analysts' forecasts. The full-year dividend of 5.5 pence was lower than expected, however. 
 BSkyB shares shed seven pence to 530p in early trading, having climbed to record highs in recent days. 
 "The continuing growth in subscribers, the increase in the number of channels and the renewal of the Premier League (soccer) contract until 2001 provide a firm base from which to pioneer the development of digital television in the UK," chief executive Sam Chisholm said in a statement. 
 "The agreement with Kirch Gruppe to develop the digital platform in Germany gives us a great opportunity to extend our business into continental Europe," he said. 
 BSkyB plans to launch a British digital television service next year. 
 Last month it signed a deal with the group headed by Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch under which it will take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1, Kirch's digital pay television operation. 
 BSkyB is expected to inject 200 million pounds into the alliance to cover start-up losses over the next three years. The deal gives BSkyB access to Europe's largest television market. 
 BSkyB said spending on programming rose by 28 percent to 420 million pounds after the purchase of golf, boxing and cricket events and the launch of new channels such as Disney. 
 The programming spend is set to rise further following a 670 million pound deal signed in June which will enable BSkyB to retain rights to broadcast live English Premier League soccer for the next five years. 
 One cloud on the horizon is a report that British cable companies may seek European Commission intervention over the fees BSkyB charges for its top channels. 
 The Financial Times said the cable companies fear they will not secure satisfactory conditions despite BSkyB undertakings to revise the structure of its wholesale rate card.

 AUSTRALIA: Aborigines burn flag in Canberra budget protests. 
 Aborigines burn flag in Canberra budget protests. 
 Terry Friel 
 CANBERRA 1996-08-20 
 
 Aborigines burnt an Australian flag during an anti-budget rally in front of parliament house on Tuesday and clashed with police as Treasurer Peter Costello assured Australians his first budget at 0930 GMT would be fair. 
 Hundreds of other Aborigines staged rallies in Brisbane and Adelaide against already announced cuts to indigenous funding in the 1996/97 budget. 
 "Everyone, if you want to come and stamp on the white law, and the white flag, stamp on the ashes like they stamped on ours," said an Aborigine as the Australian flag burned. 
 The aboriginal protest, which attracted about 1,000 people, was rowdy, with chanting, didgeridoo playing and rhythm sticks. At one stage Aborigines tried to enter the nearby old parliament house, but were repelled by police in riot gear. 
 About 150 Aborigines attacked police with bricks, bottles and stakes during a 20-minute confrontation at the old parliament house. One policewoman was repeatedly kicked and has been taken to hospital in a serious condition, a police spokeswoman said. 
 On Monday, an anti-government rally of 15,000 unionists, Aborigines, students and welfare groups in front of Canberra's parliament ended in a riot, as hundreds of protesters stormed into the parliament's foyer. 
 Police wearing riot gear took two hours to control the riot. 
 "All we want is justice in our own country," aboriginal activist Charles Perkins told Tuesday's rally. 
 "We don't want budget cuts -- it's hard enough as it is," said Perkins, standing in front of a map of Australia painted with the aboriginal flag and the words: "Sovereignty never ceded". "The money that Australia has comes from aboriginal land. Give us a fair go," he said. 
 Aborigines, the most disadvantaged group in Australian society, have labelled "racist" A$400 million (US$312 million) in indigenous spending cuts over the next four years. 
 Deputy chair of the peak Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, Ray Robinson, told Tuesday's rally that reconciliation between white and black Australia was dead. 
 "Forget about reconciliation that's finished," he said. 
 "They say we must continue on with the reconciliation. Do you stab someone in the guts with a knife and while they are dying, say we want to be friends? It doesn't happen that way." 
 The five-month-old Liberal-National government was to announce its budget to June 30, 1997 at 0930 GMT. The budget will be its first and the first for a conservative Australian government in 14 years. 
 "It's going to be a fair budget, and we are looking forward to putting in place the measures that will help families and small businesses and get Australia moving," treasurer Costello told reporters on Tuesday morning. 
 The government has promised to cut A$4.0 billion from its maiden budget in a tough fiscal programme aimed at achieving a budget surplus within three years. The budget deficit for 1995/96 was A$10.3 billion. 
 Financial markets are concerned about Australia's chronic national savings and external debt problems and are counting on Costello slashing the budget deficit, hopefully by more than the forecast A$4.0 billion.

 AUSTRALIA: Australian Alan Bond sentenced to three years jail. 
 Australian Alan Bond sentenced to three years jail. 
 PERTH, Australia 1996-08-20 
 
 Failed Australian businessman Alan Bond was sentenced to three years in jail on Tuesday for fraud involving the French impressionist painting, La Promenade. 
 In sentencing Bond, Western Australia District Court Judge Antoinette Kennedy said that while the jail term was not the maximum 14 years she could impose, it would seem like a "life sentence" to Bond. 
 Bond, 58, who became a national hero in 1983 for backing Australia's capture of the America's Cup yachting trophy, had appealed for a non-custodial sentence. His lawyer argued that a jail term could kill him because of his failing health. 
 But Kennedy said she was satisfied that Bond's "health problems could be monitored within the prison system". Bond said he suffers from blood pressure and heart problems. 
 "The sentence I intend to impose on you, you will not regard as lenient, but many in the community will," Kennedy said. "When I speak of the community I do not speak of the vicious and the hate-filled -- they are insatiable -- but reasonable members of the community. 
 "Such people must understand that time in prison goes a lot slower than time outside ... and that any prison sentence is a life sentence in a sense for someone in your position, in that you can not sink into anonymity, but it will follow you for ever." 
 Last Friday, Bond was found guilty of improperly using his position as director of his former corporate flagship, Bond Corporation Holdings, to allow his private company to buy Edouard Manet's La Promenade from Bond Corp for A$2.5 million (US$1.9 million), when its value was at least A$12 million. 
 Bond's Dallhold Investments Pty Ltd sold the painting a year later at auction in New York for A$17 million. 
 The Australian Securities Commission, the nation's corporate watchdog, brought four fraud charges against Bond for his 1988 actions. 
 Kennedy said Bond's passion for art and his inability to accept that Bond Corp was not longer his "fiefdom" combined to encourage him to commit the fraud offences. 
 Bond's lawyers said he would appeal the conviction.

 British FTSE index closes at record 3,883 points. 
 Elaine Hardcastle 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Britain's FTSE 100 stock index, which sank to its lowest year level a month ago, chalked up a record closing high on Tuesday led by bullish retail sector sentiment. 
 "You probably couldn't have forecast a better background for the equity market than the one we've currently got," said one senior share trader. "The market has a lot going for it." 
 The blue chip index closed 19.5 points higher at 3,883.2, surpassing the previous 3,872.9 record it set just last week. 
 Gainers outweighed decliners by a margin of two to one but volume was a subdued 512.9 million shares as all eyes remained fixed on the outcome of the interest rate setting U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee, which was meeting as the London market closed. 
 The retail stocks which led an early advance were boosted by the latest economic figures which flagged an improvement in British consumer sentiment. 
 "The consumer credit figures this morning showed another booming month -- the consumer is back with a vengeance," another trader said. 
 But the return of the so-called "feel-good factor" in the retail sector may also reduce the likelihood of any further cuts in UK interest rates, traders said. 
 This view was shared by Britain's largest mortgage lender, the Halifax Building Society. 
 "(A rate cut) would be more politically inspired than by the needs of the housing market," Halifax chairman Jon Foulds told reporters at the company's interim results' presentation. 
 Leading the retail sector's advance, GUS was squeezed 23p higher to close at 663p, following the release of strong interim results from discount retailer Argos yesterday. 
 On the back of the same wave of optimism, electronics retailer Dixons gained 11p to 535p and Kingfisher ended 14p higher at 668p, with dealers saying some investors anticipate more positive news from other half year results in the sector. 
 Whether the UK share market as a whole continues to go from strength to strength is largely dependent on events across the Atlantic, especially and the outcome of the FOMC policy meeting. 
 "We've really seen little or no selling today, (and) most people are assuming there will be no change (in U.S. rates)," one senior dealer said. 
 But trade remained cautious in the U.S. and the Dow was little changed, up 3.7 points, when London markets closed. 
 "We are still looking for reasurrance on U.S. rates," a dealer said. "If they don't increase rates now, we want to know when are they likely to".

 UK: Silver fixes at two-month high, but gold lags. 
 Silver fixes at two-month high, but gold lags. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Silver fixed at its highest level since June 19, 1996 on Tuesday morning following buying by speculators late on Monday in New York. 
 Silver fixed at $5.2025 an ounce, up 12 cents from Monday's fix and eight cents above Monday's London close. 
 It had eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight. 
 But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week. "There has seen some good hedge-fund buying of silver call options, and also the underlying (silver metal) recently," a dealer said. Silver closed in London at $5.23, up 12 cents. 
 Options are popular with market speculators as they offer a cheap way into betting on price movements. 
 An option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a commodity at a set price at some specified future date. 
 "It's a purely technical move, but I can see it going for $5.30 this week," the dealer added. 
 Gold's reaction was half-hearted. The yellow metal closed just 90 cents firmer at $387.55. 
 "Gold has had a bit of a dismal performance. The move seems to be just in silver," one dealer said. 
 The grains markets which headlined the commodities' markets on Monday turned lower on forecasts of more favourable growing wheather in the North American wheat regions. 
 "The chances of frost were taken out of the forecasts for Canada," a Chicago-based trader said. 
 On the Chicago Board of Trade futures markets at 0945 CDT, wheat for September delivery was down 2-1/2 cents at $4.57. 
 September corn was down 1-1/2 cents at $3.62-1/2 and August soybeans were down 1-3/4 cents at $8.13. 
 Industrial metals were quiet with copper prices coming back $11.00 on the London Metal Exchange from $1,942 at Monday's close after stocks in the exchange's warehouses recorded a rise of 5,000 tonnes to 266,000 tonnes. 
 Dealers said the market's stock overhang had reduced the anxiety earlier in the year of finding metal to deliver to customers. Aluminium was only $1.00 lower at $1,489. 
 White sugar futures put in a fairly robust performance, though the lack of strong fundamental news capped the market below key resistance near the $355.50 area, traders said. 
 December cocoa futures raced to a six week high, then eased below 1,040 stg in modest activity. By mid afternoon the December contract was up 12 stg at 1,037 stg. 
 The coffee price reaction modestly to a drop of 6,259 60-kg bags in the U.S. certified coffee stockpile to 34,516 bags. 
 The November contract was up only $3 at $1,660 as the fall was within forecasters' expectations.

 UK Investment Trust discounts stable end July - AITC. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Average discounts on UK investment trusts were stable at the end of July at 10.86 percent, slightly down from the June average of 10.94 percent, a statement from the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) showed. 
 There was also evidence discounts could be narrowing again. Figures from the Datastream Consortium List showed the average discount at nine percent on August 14, the AITC said. 
 Ernest Fenton, director general of the AITC noted that discounts are "often misunderstood by individual investors." 
 He said "Discounts are not an automatic indication of poor performance or poor returns on investments. In fact, the most popular funds -- generalist investment trusts -- show a 11-12 percent discount and have an exemplary record over the last 10 years." 
 Since 1986, the average discount has hit a low of 4.11 percent in 1994 and a high of 22.08 percent in 1987, AITC data showed. 
 In sector averages at the end of June, property, Continental Europe, Emerging market, single country funds and venture and development capital funds had the highest discounts (above 18 percent) while the lowest discounts applied to Far East funds, including and excluding Japan. 
 At the end of July, the highest discounts hit North American, Continental Europe and single country funds while the lowest were closed end funds.

 UK: IBCA affirms Italian foreign currency ratings. 
 IBCA affirms Italian foreign currency ratings. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 European credit rating agency IBCA said on Tuesday it affirmed its long-term foreign currency debt rating of Italy at AA minus and said the country may have finally turned the corner in its battle for fiscal reform. 
 "The rating applies to $92.9 billion of senior and unsecured foreign currency debt obligations of the Republic and sets a ceiling for the foreign currency rating of all Italian entities," IBCA said in a statement. 
 IBCA also confirmed its rating of A1 plus for short-term foreign currency issues and assigned a long-term local currency rating of AAA to sovereign debt. 
 "The small reduction in the public debt to GDP ratio in 1995 - the first since 1980 - signals a possible turning point in Italy's problematic fiscal policy," the agency said. 
 But IBCA said the path would not be easy. 
 "A relatively small adverse shift in the macroeconomic environment will be sufficient to blow the government's public debt to gdp projections off course," it said. "IBCA is projecting that the public debt to GDP ratio will rise this year, although it should fall in the more favourable macroeconomic environment expected in 1997." 
 In July, rating agency Moody's Investors Service raised its foreign currency sovereign ceiling rating on Italy to Aa3 from A1. In late April, Standard & Poor's affirmed its AA foreign currency rating for Italy. 
 IBCA said Italy had considerable strengths as a sovereign credit. These were illustrated by "the continued dynamism" of the private sector, a current account surplus and a high savings ratio. "These aspects of the economy have allowed Italy to sustain high public debt without having to draw on foreign savings," it said.

 UK: Complaints surge over UK "demonic" political ads. 
 Complaints surge over UK "demonic" political ads. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 A British industry watchdog said on Tuesday it had been flooded with complaints about an advertising campaign that depicted opposition Labour leader Tony Blair with demonic eyes. 
 The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) told Reuters it had received about 100 complaints and would decide in a few days whether the campaign broke rules that ban offensive ads and those that unfairly infringe on the privacy of public figures. 
 If the rules were breached by the ads, which were run by the incumbent Conservative Party in British newspapers this month, the ASA will ban the ads. 
 "The advertising industry itself doesn't want political advertising to degenerate into mud-slinging," an advertising industry source told Reuters. 
 The ASA has received written responses to the complaints from M&C Saatchi, the advertising agency that created the campaign and that was started last year by Maurice Saatchi and his brother, Charles. 
 The Saatchi brothers were ousted in December 1994 from Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, which they formed in 1970. 
 The ads showed Tony Blair with a manic grin and red demonic eyes gleaming out from behind a black strip. 
 British newspapers this week quoted the actor whose eyes were used for the ads, Scott Woods, as saying he was upset about the campaign. 
 He told newspapers he had known photos of his eyes were being used for a Conservative Party campaign, but not that they would be used to make Blair look evil. 
 Woods, who specialises in playing serial killers, pirates and demons because of his mad, staring eyes, said he was a Labour supporter and planned to vote for Blair.

 UK: London's Globe, an experiment in theatre history. 
 London's Globe, an experiment in theatre history. 
 Helen Smith 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 In a theatre open to London's often rainy skies, a troupe of actors begins a risky experiment on Wednesday to discover what William Shakespeare's plays were like when first peformed 400 years ago. 
 The Globe Theatre is a replica of the 20-sided wood-and-thatch arena which Shakespeare part-owned and where his finest works, including "Macbeth," "Hamlet" and "King Lear", were staged during his lifetime. 
 It is the realisation of the dream of American actor-director Sam Wanamaker, who died of cancer in 1993, just as the theatre's wooden framework was being put in place. 
 Wanamaker had waged a 40-year battle against bureacracy and commercial greed to get the new Globe built just yards (metres) from the site of the original on the south bank of the Thames, opposite St Paul's Cathedral. 
 His vision is still central to the 30 million pound ($46 million) Globe, which begins a "prologue season" on Wednesday with a production of "Two Gentlemen of Verona." 
 "Anyone who worked with Sam was very much influenced by what he wanted to put together," said Lennie James, who plays one of the "Two Gentlemen." 
 Interviewed under grey skies in the Globe's auditorium on Tuesday, James said the place feels permeated with a sense of history. 
 "When (artistic director Mark Rylance) first welcomed us onto the stage saying we were the first actors in 400 years to stand here, I got a real buzz," he said. 
 Wanamaker's aim was to recreate, as far as possible, the conditions that Shakespeare's actors worked under in the 16th and 17th centuries. 
 The audience, many of them standing, would have been crowded around the stage ready to heckle the actors and punish bad performances with volleys of rotten fruit. 
 The actors had little time to learn their roles and would not have seen the full script, which was kept carefully guarded for fear that it would be stolen by another theatre. 
 The Globe has been carefully recreated from historical records and what could be gleaned from excavation of the original, destroyed in 1644 by England's puritan rulers. But little is still known about the theatres of the day. 
 Rylance said he hoped that working before a live audience would help show up anything the historians got wrong. 
 "We do not claim that this is it," said the boyish Rylance. "This is the best we can do in 1996. There's bound to be more evidence and we look forward to it." 
 Notwithstanding his search for authenticity, Rylance's production will depart drastically from Shakespearian traditions. 
 The cast of "Two Gentlemen of Verona" will include women and black actors, both unheard of in Shakespeare's day, and the play is set in modern Italy. 
 Even less traditional, the Globe will be selling cushions for the hard seats and raincoats -- thunderstorms are in the weather forecast for the opening night. 
 The choice of "Two Gentleman of Verona", one of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays, has raised critics' eyebrows, but Rylance says it is symbolic. 
 It was written before the original Globe was built in 1599, just as the prologue predates the scheduled official opening of its successor in June 1997, he said.

 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 British Sky Broadcasting said on Tuesday it had not been charged mainstream UK corporation tax in its last financial year and did not expect to do so in the current year. 
 Finance director Richard Brooke said the company did not expect to pay corporation tax until 1997/98. 
 The company said in its results statement for the year to June 30, 1996 that there was no charge "as each company in the Group either incurred losses or made profits which were offset by tax losses brought forward or by group relief." 
 "There remain within the Group substantial tax losses and other timing differences which are expected to be available in the future to offset against Mainstream Corporation Tax liabilities," the statement added. 
 It said that during the year just ended the company had provided for 23.6 million stg of Advance Corporation Tax (ACT) on the year's dividends.

 BSkyB sees digital TV link with BT. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting could link up with British Telecom to provide new services when it launches digital television next year. 
 "That is a possibility," said BSkyB chief executive Sam Chisholm when asked about the prospect of linking with BT to supply interactive services. 
 BSkyB is planning to launch digital satellite television late next year and is reportedly talking to a number of partners about promoting and subsidising the launch. 
 "We need to be able to get decoders to customers at the best price," said Chisholm.   
 "There is no question that there is a very big demand for it (digital satellite) if you can get it right," he added. 
 He said that BSkyB was ideally placed for a digital launch thanks to the success of its analogue services. BSkyB now has some 5.5 million subscribers in Britain and Ireland. 
 Chisholm said he could not comment on negotiations with the BBC on setting up new channels based on BBC programming. 
 "Most of it is widely reported in the press...I don't want to add anything to it," he said. 
 BSkyB faces strong competition from cable and satellite channel group Flextech for the deal with the BBC.   
 Flextech, 51 percent owned by Tele-Communications Inc of Denver, is seen as the favourite to clinch an agreement as it could provide the BBC with access to the north American market.

 UK: Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher. 
 Silver hits two-month peak, gold edges higher. 
 LONDON 1996-08-20 
 
 Silver prices were at their highest levels since mid-June on Tuesday after speculative buying sent the New York market surging overnight, dealers said. 
 Gold followed only reluctantly, but market analysts said it could eventually make a go of breaking through its recent price ceiling at just under $390 an ounce. 
 Silver was indicated at $5.20 an ounce, up eight cents from Monday's London close and its highest price since June 19. 
 It eased a bit as dealers took their profits in early European business after reaching a peak of $5.26 overnight. 
 But several dealers said they saw it venturing higher later this week. 
 "There has seen some good hedge-fund buying of silver call options, and also the underlying (silver metal) recently," a dealer said. 
 Options are popular with market speculators as they offer a cheap way into betting on price movements. 
 An option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a commodity at a set price at some specified future date. 
 "It's a purely technical move, but I can see it going for $5.30 this week," the dealer added. 
 Technical analysts or chartists who follow detailed charts of past prices noted that the rally could run into selling at silver's 200-day moving average price of $5.33 per ounce. 
 In contrast, bullion fixed at just $387.10 an ounce, versus $386.40 on Monday afternoon and $386.25 in the morning. 
 "Gold has had a bit of a dismal performance. The move seems to be just in silver," one dealer said. 
 But some chartists said gold has scope to move higher. 
 "Obviously much depends on gold's ability to clear the critical resistance immediately below $390," said analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge. 
 "But silver's recovery following what is looking to be a false breakdown earlier below $5.00 adds to the evidence this may occur," she added. 
 Some analysts said gold was being cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in New York later on Tuesday in case of surprises regarding interest rates. 
 Another dampener was a slump in the South African rand. 
 "There's been some (South African gold) producer selling with the weaker rand," a dealer said, referring to the currency's overnight slump to 4.59 to the U.S. dollar. 
 Palladium was slightly firmer, up $0.60 at $124.65 and off recent 2-1/2 year lows. But dealers were disappointed palladium had not absorbed more strength from silver. 
 The same was true for platinum, which was up just $1.10 at $399.50, dealers said.

 "The only way to reduce the discount to net asset value at which KEPIT is trading is to look at unitisation," M&G spokeswoman Rachel Medill said. 
 August 19 was the closing date for bids for the 500 million pound trust, which attracted record subscriptions for a British investment trust when it was launched in 1994. Unitisation means shareholders would then hold units in a trust that owned shares, rather than owning shares directly.

 U.S. West next-day power firm, back-months lower. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Physical electricity prices for next-day delivery in the western U.S. were firm Tuesday, but power for deferred month deliveries were traded mostly lower, brokers and marketers said. 
 Next-day prices were bolstered by Bonneville Power Administration raising its posting for 16-hour power blocks for Wednesday delivery by two dollars to $17.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), market sources said. 
 Deferred month values were weaker amid a second-day of active selling, they said. "People are seeing these outer months are well overvalued," said a Houston trader. 
 A substantial decline in the natural gas market also pressured electricity prices lower, traders said. 
 NYMEX September Gulf Coast natgas futures were in the $2.060 area, off more than 12 cents per million British thermal units. 
 In the physical market, California-Oregon Border (COB) prices for firm, peak delivery were quoted at $16.00-$17.00 per MWh, up from Monday's $15.00-$16.00, market sources said. 
 September COB power for firm, peak delivery was assessed at $17.10-$17.90, up from Monday's $17.00-$17.40 range. 
 October COB, with similar delivery terms, was pegged at $15.50-$15.90, down from $15.75-$16.60 on Monday. Firm, peak COB for the 1996 fourth-quarter was valued at $16.90-$17.25, flat from Monday. 
 At the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) point in Washington, firm, peak electricity prices for next-day delivery were quoted at $15.00-$15.50 per MWh, up from Monday's $14.50-$15.50. 
 September Mid-C electricity was pegged at $16.50-$17.10, down slightly from Monday's $16.50-$17.20. 
 Down at the Palo Verde (PV) switchyard near Phoenix, Ariz., next-day power for peak, firm delivery was valued at $21.00-$22.00 per MWh, near unchanged from Monday's range. 
 September firm, peak PV electricity was quoted at $20.75-$21.25, flat from Monday. 
 October PV electricity, with similary delivery terms, was assessed at $15.90-$16.10. Fourth-quarter PV prices was quoted at $16.30-$16.70, down from Monday's $16.90-$17.25 range.

 US mortgage-backeds mixed, tighter to Treasuries. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 U.S. mortgage-backed securities were mixed on Tuesday afternoon after the Federal Reserve concluded its policy meeting with no announcement on interest rates. 
 Pass-throughs were unchanged to 2/32 higher in very light trading, traders said. Discount coupons lost their early gains -- about 3/32 -- while premiums generally held on. 
 Yields over Treasuries narrowed two to three basis points. 
 Treasuries slipped modestly after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but fixed-income analysts said government securities had been well-positioned ahead of the meeting.   
 Late on Tuesday, GNMA 30-year 7.5 percent coupons were up 1/32 at 99-05/32, yielding 110 basis points over 10-year Treasuries. 
 Comparable FNMAs were up 1/32 at 99-08/32. And FHLMC 30-year 7.5 percent pass-throughs were unchanged at 99-10/32. 
 With the FOMC behind them, analysts said the August employment report, set for release September 6, becomes the market's next focus. 
 While only three of 29 economists polled on Tuesday said the Fed will raise rates next month, several experts said payrolls could sway their interest rate forecasts.

 USA: Natgas futures end down sharply as longs exit. 
 Natgas futures end down sharply as longs exit. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended down sharply Tuesday in a lackluster session, as longs rushed to liquidate amid perceptions a storm in the Caribbean would not threaten U.S. Gulf gas production, sources said. 
 September tumbled 13.4 cents to close near the day's low at $2.053 per million British thermal units. Oct settled 13 cents lower at $2.124. Others ended down by one to 10.5 cents. 
 "People are not expecting it (Hurricane Dolly) to affect a lot of production. I think it was a bit overdone and we could rebound a little from here, but it depends on what the storm does overnight," said one Houston-based trader.   
 But forecasters still expected Dolly to approach the Texas-Mexico border, and some traders remained concerned that a slight turn to the north could put offshore Texas platforms in jeopardy. 
 Hurricane Dolly slammed into Mexico's Yucatan peninsula Tuesday afternoon with 75 mph winds, moving west-northwest at 13 mph. At 1400 EDT, the center was located at 19.3 degrees north and 87.9 degrees west. 
 Cash prices at the U.S. Gulf Coast firmed slightly Tuesday to about the $2.10 area, still almost 20 cents below August indices. Midcon pipes scored similar gains to the low-$1.90s, about 20 cents under August 1 levels. 
 The 12-month strip tumbled 6.2 cents to $2.133. NYMEX said 33,849 Henry Hub contracts traded, up from Monday's revised tally of 24,317. 
 NYMEX September Henry Hub natgas futures expire Monday, August 26. 
 NYMEX September Permian natgas closed four cents lower at $1.82, while deferreds settled down by 3.5 cents but again were untraded. NYMEX said 30 Permian contracts traded, down from Monday's total of 85. 
 NYMEX September Permian natgas futures expire Wednesday August 28. 
 On the KCBT, September finished down by seven cents at $1.88, while deferreds ended one to six cents lower. The East/West spread narrowed by 6.4 cents to 17.3 cents (NYMEX premium).

 USA: LDC debts seesaw in narrow ranges, ignore Fed. 
 LDC debts seesaw in narrow ranges, ignore Fed. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 

 The U.S. interest rate status quo was shrugged off in the quiet trading of emerging market debts and the Brady bonds finished the day mostly flat. 
 "The absence of a rate hike was already priced in," said Shafiq Islam, emerging market fixed income strategist at Credit Suisse. "It is marginally positive." 
 Argentina Bradies came under light pressure as investors watched with concern how the new economy minisiter, Roque Fernandez, negotiates between raising taxes to cut deficits and appeasing the public to risk falling further behind fiscal target, traders said.   
 The International Monetary Fund officials are in Buenos Aires to review Argentine fiscal deficits which are expected to reach $6.6 billion this year. 
 Argentina FRBs eased 1/8 to 77-1/4 and Argentina Pars slipped 3/8 to 54-3/4. 
 Brazil fared slightly better than Argentina, with Brazil C adding 3/8 to 65-1/8. 
 "With or without (Brady bond) buy-back, Brazil papers may still have some room to rise," said a Brady trader.   
 While Brazil's trade deficit of $334 million in July would not pose a problem to the currency, the stalled reform continued casting a shadow, he said. 
 Mexico papers were underpinned by the robust 7.2 percent gross domestic product growth in the second quarter, but some market participants questioned if the optimism might be overstated. 
 "If the second quarter is compared to the first quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, you get only a one-percent growth," said Shafiq at Credit Suisse. 
 Mexico Pars rose 1/8 to 67-1/2 and Discount added 1/4 to 80-3/8. 
 Among East European papers, Bulgaria was depressed by recurring concerns about its weak currency and low level of reserves, traders said. 
 Bulgaria FLRB lost 1/2 to 33-1/4. 
 Russia debt prices retreated on profit-taking. 
 "We are comfortable with Russia," said a U.S. bank trader. With the IMF about to release the delayed tranche of aid and the overall low indebtedness, Russia debts were still relatively cheap, he said.

 U.S. crude oil stocks held in primary storage rose 296,000 barrels in the week ended Aug 16 to 308.43 million barrels from 308.13 million in the prior week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said Tuesday. 
 API said gasoline stocks fell 864,000 barrels in the week to 197.79 million from a revised 198.65 million barrels that was previously reported as 197.64 million. Distillate stocks rose 1.83 million barrels to 106.12 million from 104.29 million. 
 It said reformulated gasoline stocks (RFG) rose 262,000 barrels to 39.34 million barrels from 39.08 million barrels in the previous week.

 USA: U.S. diesel tax suspended for pleasure boats. 
 U.S. diesel tax suspended for pleasure boats. 
 WASHINGTON 1996-08-20 
 
 President Clinton Tuesday signed legislation to suspend the 24.4 cents per gallon federal tax on diesel fuel used by recreational boaters. 
 The suspension, in effect from Aug. 27, 1996, to Dec. 31, 1997, was included in a law to raise the minimum wage. 
 "Seven days from now, our waterways will be less hazardous for many boaters who should be able to purchase the same red-dyed, non-taxed fuel used by commercial mariners, which is more widely available around the country," Michael Sciulla, government affairs director of the Boat Owners Association of the United States, said in a statement. 
 Recreational boaters have complained that the government's fuel-dying program caused fuel shortages and safety problems. 
 The Treasury Department must send a report to Congress by April 1, 1997, on alternative means of collecting the diesel tax, first levied in 1994.

 U.S. foreign crude interest wilts on NYMEX expiry. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 

 Interest in U.S. foreign crude remained subdued amid choppy outright price activity related to the expiry on Tuesday of NYMEX September crude futures. 
 The absence of September cargoes offered into the U.S. Gulf was still blamed on narrow profit margins. 
 "Apart from one or two Qua Iboes and maybe a Bonny Light, nobody's seen anything," a Houston trader said. 
 Vague rumors of Malaysian Tapis being offered for September delivery could not be immediately pinned down. 
 Overall, profit taking in crude futures kept discussion in physical markets to a minimum, traders said.   
 September West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was pegged at $22.80-90 a barrel, down 25 cents from Monday's cash market. 
 Latin American crude differentials, meanwhile, clawed higher amid tight supplies. 
 September Cusiana was heard offered close to WTI parity, up from October minus 27 cents fob in a recent deal, with late Sept asked at a shade under November WTI. 
 Spot Cano Limon for September was pegged around WTI minus $1.65-70 a barrel fob, after Ecopetrol's tender last week went for minus $1.65 a barrel, traders said. 
 A couple of September Oriente cargoes were seen available and priced around WTI minus $1.80. 
 The upgrading of Tropical Storm Dolly to a hurricane just before making landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula this afternoon, has so far not caused any crude shipping delays. 
 In the U.S. aftermarket, cash Brent traded at September Brent plus two cents fob for Aug 29-31, less than yesterday's trade at Sept plus 15 cents. 
 Brent intermonth Sep/Oct traded thrice at 50 cents, off 10 cents from morning levels.

 USA: US CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - Home on a range. 
 US CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - Home on a range. 
 Jose Paulo Vicente 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-21 
 
 U.S. credit markets will likely remain rangebound on Wednesday as players focus on scant fresh economic data and the annoucement of the monthly supply of two- and five-year notes, analysts said. 
 "I think we're going to consolidate for a while ... people are going over the next week or so start thinking about things that might influence the Fed at their next meeting," said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. 
 The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee met on Tuesday and decided, as expected, to keep interest rates unchanged.   
 The federal funds rate was kept at 5.25 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee will meet next on September 24. 
 Analysts said the market's next main hurdles will be the employment report (Sept 6) and the National Association of Purchasing Management index on (Sept 3). Both indicators are for the month of August. 
 "The employment and the NAPM are going to be two very key indicators," Thayers said. "But between now and then I think that if we were to see continued strength on commodity prices or a weaking of the dollar, that could be something the market would be focusing on too," he added.   
 On Wednesday, the market will take in import and export prices for July at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT. Later in the day, players will get the federal budget figures for July. 
 A Reuters survey of economists show they expect the data, due out at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT, to stay at a negative $25.2 billion against a positive $34.1 billion in June. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City survey is also due out on Wednesday at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT. 
 "We'll have some data tomorrow, but they really are not expect to move the market. I guess we're still in a range here," said a trader at a U.S. investment bank.   
 Analysts see the yield on the 30-year T-bonds ranging between 6.75 percent and 6.85 percent on Wednesday. 
 Market watchers will also keep a very close eye on the annoucement of fresh supply on Wednesday, when the Treasury will set its monthly two- and five-year note auctions. 
 Analysts expect the Treasury to sell roughly $18.75 bilion in two-year notes and $12.5 billion in five-year securities. 
 Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at consulting firm I.E.D.E., said there is a growing sentiment in the market that the Federal Reserve might keep interest rates steady throughout the year of 1996.   
 Stilles added that "the only way you could justify the two-year note getting underwritten below six percent and the five-year note below 6-3/8 percent is if that idea gets and retains more popularity." 
 Otherwise, Stiles said the two's and five's would have to back up and put a little risk back into the yields in order to lure new buyers to the auctions. 
 On Tuesday, the 30-year bond spent the day in a lull to trade down 1/32 at 99-12/32 in late trade. Its yield was at 6.80 percent.   
 The Fed refrained from operations in the open market on Tuesday. The federal funds rate is seen opening at 5.13 percent on Wednesday, analysts said.

 Huntsman drops offer to acquire Rexene. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Privately held Huntsman Corp said it is dropping a $460 million unsolicited bid for Rexene Corp after its two offers were rejected. 
 Huntsman also said it would not pursue a hostile tender offer for Rexene, a move that some Wall Street takeover traders had anticipated. 
 "I'm washing my hands of the entire matter. Huntsman Corp is not interested in pursuing further negotiations nor in commencing an unsolicted tender offer at this time. It is simply not worth the aggravation," chief executive officer Jon Huntsman said in a news release.   
 Huntsman said it made the decision after Rexene financial adviser Schroder-Wertheim indicated the Rexene board would reject bids substantially above its $15 per share offer. 
 Huntsman's first bid of $14 per share was rejected by Rexene on July 22. The Salt Lake City-based chemical company then sweetened the offer to $15 per share on August 1, but Rexene rejected that bid as well. 
 The unsolicited bid also included the assumption of $175 million of debt. 
 Rexene did not have any immediate comment on Huntsman's decision.   
 But Huntsman warned that the cyclical chemical industry is already seeing a decline in margins and prices. In spurning the offer, Rexene said shareholder value would be boosted by its strategic investment plan, which includes additional capacity and the expansion of product offerings. 
 "In my opinion, Rexene's shareholders won't see our offering in the value of Rexene stock for years to come. The shareholders should be very disappointed," Huntsman said. 
 The move by Huntsman marks the second time in recent months that the nation's largest privately held chemical company, long known for successful acquisitions, failed to win a target company. 
 Family-owned Huntsman launched a bid for Sterling Chemicals Inc in April, but the effort failed when the target instead opted for a management and investor buyout. 
 Shares of Rexene, which were trading at 9 before Huntsman launched its bid, tumbled 2 to 10-1/2 in after-hours trading.

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co (PG&E) said its Diablo Canyon nuclear power units are expected to reach full output Wednesday after being scaled back Monday because of a wildfire in the nearby Los Padres forest. 
 "We hope to be at 100 percent power tomorrow sometime," said PG&E spokeswoman Arlene Morris-Versaw, adding the California Department of Forestry started backfires to contain the blaze about two hours ago (1100 PDT/1800 GMT). 
 Efforts to fight the blaze earlier today were hampered by strong winds. 
 "The plan is for the backburn to continue until tonight," she said. "The winds are (now) favorable." 
 If the backfires are successful, the utility will check for damage to the insulators of the transmission lines before ramping up both Diablo Canyon units to full power, she said. 
 The plant's two units, with a combined capacity of 2,160 megawatt (MW), are currentrly producing at 75 percent of capacity. 
 On Monday, PG&E, as a precaution, shifted all transmission from Diablo Canyon to just one 5,000 kilovolt (KV) line after shutting the two 5,000 KV lines closest to the fire. 
 Diablo Canyon is at Avila Beach on the California coast.

 PHOENIX 1996-08-20 
 
 Main Street and Main Inc said sales at its restaurants continue at softer-than-expected levels with same store revenue figures since the end of the company's second quarter down roughly five percent. 
 Sales continue to remain soft, but we (are focused) on ways to increase earnings," Joe Panter, president, said in a statement along with the company's second quarter results. 
 For the quarter ended July 1, the restaurant operator lost $0.92 a share, including a $0.94 per share charge, versus a $0.09 profit one year ago. Same store sales were off two percent for the quarter and 1.7 percent for the six months.   
 Main Street said the lower same store sales were attributable, principally, to six restaurants. The company operates a total of 43 casual dining restaurants. 
 The company noted the performance of its one "Front Row Sports Grill" negatively effected earnings and it is "considering various alternatives" about its future. 
 Main Street did not say what those alternatives were and a company official was not immediately available to comment. 
 The company said its total $7.4 million charge covered the write-off of one promissory note, some real estate, pre-opening costs of three restaurants and and other expenses.

 FOCUS - Fed stays put, but rate hike seen inevitable.

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 While the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at its meeting Tuesday, the odds of monetary tightening are likely to mount as 1996 comes to a close, analysts said. 
 Fed policy-makers astutely resisted pressures earlier this summer to raise short-term rates, but economic data over the next several weeks will almost certainly force the Fed to grudgingly tighten credit later this year, analysts said.   
 "My guess is (Fed tightening) is going to be right back on tap after the August data start coming out," said Salomon Brothers economist Brian Jones. 
 In a Reuters poll of 28 economists to be released later on Tuesday, a majority predicted the Fed would move to tighten credit at its November 13 meeting. 
 The Fed has held its target for the federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- at 5.25 percent since January 31, 1996.   
 Despite signs of strong economic growth since then, inflation remains quite low, and the Fed has refrained from raising rates in the absence of more troubling data. 
 But upcoming U.S. employment data could change all that, analysts said. 
 Persistent job growth threatens to shatter the economy's recent low-inflation trend and the Fed will not stand idly by and watch that happen, analysts said.   
 "The job market is still quite firm. We'll need to see jobless claims move back up pretty soon in order to confirm the economic slowdown story," said Josh Feinman, global markets economist at BT Securities Corp. 
 Jobless claims' four-week moving average reached a seven-year low last week, adding to recent warnings of pending wage inflation. 
 That also suggests the economy continues to churn out new jobs at a pace likely to drag the unemployment rate lower than July's 5.4 percent reading, analysts said.   
 The absence of faster inflation amid such robust job creation has many analysts scratching their heads and wondering how long the Fed will hold monetary policy steady. 
 "Strong job growth has persisted long enough that the Fed will certainly have to stand up and take notice," said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank. 
 The Fed's inflation-fighting reputation has flourished as the board has kept rates steady with inflation holding below 3.0 percent even as the economy chugs along nicely.   
 Critics initially blasted the Fed for failing to tighten credit at its July 2-3 FOMC meeting when a report just two days later showed that 239,000 new jobs were created in June. 
 But a month later the July report showed a decline to 193,000 in new nonfarm payrolls and, perhaps more important, a slight drop in average hourly earnings. 
 Fed officials had predicted a slowdown in real gross domestic product from the robust 4.2 percent second-quarter clip. The dip in payroll growth suddenly made that forecast look brilliant, analysts said.   
 "So far the Fed has done the right thing by keeping its powder dry," Schlossberg said. "There is still a risk the Fed could fall behind the curve, but right now it looks like the economic slowdown is happening." 
 The August employment report due September 6 could radically alter the terrain, however. 
 Salomon's Jones predicts a whopping payrolls gain of 300,000 and an official jobless rate of 5.2 percent in the August report. If correct, that could force the Fed's hand.   
 "People tried to make the July report look weak," Jones added. "But it's not like the July numbers mean we don't have to worry about tightening anymore." 
 Yet most analysts still believe the economy will decelerate in time to minimize any future inflation bubble, which may allow the Fed to keep the funds rate steady for several more months. 
 "They may have gotten lucky, but the economy has validated the Fed's strategy of waiting until they see data for the second half of the year," Feinman said. 
 "They did say the (inflation) risks were to the upside, but that the whole point of their strategy was to wait until they saw how the third quarter was turning out," he added. 
 Analysts said Fed officials would certainly prefer to postpone any rate hikes until after the November 5 presidential election.

 HOUSTON 1996-08-20 
 
 Georgia electric power cooperative Oglethorpe Power Corp said on Tuesday it is soliciting bids from power marketers to supply power on its system through the remainder of the year. 
 The cooperative, which has peak demand of more than 5,000 megawatts, also said two bidders -- LG&E Energy Corp's LG&E Power and Enron Corp's Enron Power Marketing -- are actively bidding on a long-term power marketing pact with the rural Georgia cooperative. 
 The short-term deal should be in place when the Enron pact expires at the end of August, and the long-term deal should be closed by year-end, an Oglethorpe spokesman said. 
 "We are currently in detailed negotiations, and will continue to work to accomplish that goal," said Robert Hosfeld, manager of system control for the cooperative. 
 The short-term power deal would replace a four-month pact with Enron, which supplied power to the cooperative in exchange for output from its generating plants. 
 Four marketers, including the LG&E and Enron units and consortiums formed by Duke Power/Louis Dreyfus and Morgan Stanley/PECO had been bidding on the long-term pact with Oglethorpe, which has 39 members and serves 2.6 million people.

 Southern Union sues to block merger. 
 AUSTIN, Texas 1996-08-20 
 
 Southern Union Co said on Tuesday it has filed a lawsuit to block a merger between United Cities Gas Co and Atmos Energy Corp. 
 Southern Union said it alleges that United Cities executives and directors failed to perform their fiduciary duties by approving the proposed deal with Atmos.   
 Southern Union, which holds 854,300 shares, or 6.5 percent, of United Cities, is seeking to block the deal until the United Cities board exercises its fiduciary duties. Southern Union wants United Cities to provide confidential information so it can make an informed takeover offer. 
 Atmos Energy and United Cities Gas, both natural gas providers, agreed last month that Atmos would acquire United Cities in a stock swap. 
 Atmos Energy declined to comment since it had not seen the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. United Cities was not immediately available for comment. 
 Atmos and United Cities filed a complaint with the Missouri Public Service Commission on August 6, 1996 alleging that Southern Union's purchases of United Cities shares violated state utility regulations. Southern Union said it filed a counter complaint saying it was entitled to the usual privileges of ownership associated with United Cities stock.

 The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 6.24 points, or 0.55 percent at 1124.67. Declines led advances 2053 to 1923 on volume of about 413 million shares. 
 "The Nasdaq market is still being weighed down by profit-taking in the high technologies," said Chris Callies, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston.

 U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Lawsuits turn focus to tobacco. 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 
 
 Two new lawsuits against tobacco companies helped drive options activity in Philip Morris Cos Inc on the American Stock Exchange, traders said on Tuesday. 
 Earlier in the day, Kansas and Arizona each filed lawsuits against tobacco companies including Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp's RJR Reynolds Tobacco 
 "There really is a lot of speculation going on with the new court cases out in the Midwest," said Andrew Schwarz, senior partner at AGS Specialist Partners. "People are using a variety of strategies, both on the put and call side."   
 Despite the new lawsuits, Philip Morris shares were ahead 1-1/4 at 91-1/8 in afternoon trading. 
 Schwarz said activity in Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco options included protective put buying, speculative call buying and call selling. 
 "Everybody has a different opinion" on the outcome of the various lawsuits, and players were developing their options strategies based on their expectations, Schwarz said. 
 Most action in Philip Morris options was on the put side, led by the September 80 put, with 2,123 contracts traded. With the underlying stock up, the option fell 3/16 to 3/4.   
 Other active Philip Morris puts included the September 90, with nearly 1,400 contracts traded, the September 85 with about 500 and the December 85 with nearly 400. 
 Among the calls, the September 90 and 100 each traded more than 1,000 contracts and the September 95 traded nearly 1,000. 
 Activity was relatively heavy right through the January 1997 series, with the January 90 call trading more than 400 contracts and the corresponding put trading about 260. The March 1997 100 call traded about 125 contracts. 
 For RJR Nabisco, most options trading was on the call side but combined volume in the RJR October 25 put was 260.   
 In other trading, investors were actively buying puts on shares of Cyrix Corp. 
 On the CBOE, the Cyrix September 15 put traded 533 contracts and the September 12-1/2 traded 314. The same two options traded 425 and 220 contracts, respectively, on the American Stock Exchange. 
 On the Pacific Stock Exchange, the Cyrix September 15 put traded 260 contracts and the September 12-1/2 traded 105. Call volume on Cyrix was minimal. 
 "It looks to me like just a straight downward bet," said Harrison Roth, a first vice president at Cowen & Co. Cyrix shares were off 5/16 at 14-1/4 Tuesday afternoon.   
 Call options on shares of healthcare information company Medaphis Corp remained relatively active, nearly a week after the stock lost 60 percent of its value. 
 Combined volume was 753 on the Medaphis September 15 call, 150 on the September 12-1/2 and 190 on the September 20 call. 
 Put volume was nominal. 
 Schwarz at AGS Specialist Partners said many investors had speculated the stock would rebound after its collapse, but that some who bought the calls when they were listed last Thursday had already sold off their holdings. -Gregory Crawford, 312 408-8750/E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Chile's state oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo (ENAP) has issued another buy tender for October crude oil, attempting to secure supplies in a thin market, traders said on Tuesday. 
 The new tender asks for 960,000 barrels of crude to be delivered during October 15-18, and closes on Thursday. 
 ENAP last week purchased 380,000 barrels of Ecuadorian Oriente from a trader at a price around Ecuador's sales formula plus five cents (fob), with an option for a second cargo. 
 "They are probably still trying to secure intermediate West African crudes, and at a better price," a trader said, noting prior offers may not have been at competitive prices. 
 ENAP recently bought crudes from Gabon, Angola and Nigeria, but expensive premiums and costly freight have proved prohibitive, while regional supplies have also been thin.

 USA: Dow ends stronger as Fed leaves rates unchanged. 
 Dow ends stronger as Fed leaves rates unchanged. 
 Betty Wong 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 The Dow industrials bounded higher as the Federal Reserve voted to keep monetary policy unchanged, allowing Wall Street to hurdle any lingering fears of a surprise tightening. 
 "It was as expected. If we can neutralize the interest-rate factor here, prices can go higher," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. "The last two weeks of August are the sweet spot for the market -- no corporate reports and no major economic releases."  The Dow industrials rose 22 to about 5722.   
 The blue chip index is within a stone's throw of the record close of 5778.00 on May 22. 
 Weakness in high-technology issues pressured the tech-studded Nasdaq Composite, off six to about 1125. But the broader market was firmer with gainers beating losers 6-5 on still paltry NYSE volume of about 336 million shares. 
 The long bond fell 2/32 to yield 6.80 percent after news the Fed opted to hold rates steady amid signs the economy is cooling off without inflation heating up. The decision kept the independent Fed out of the line of political fire in the runup to the Nov 5 presidential and congressional elections.   
 U.S. blue chips momentarily pared gains after the Fed news on a sell-program that wiped 12 points off the Dow, according to Birinyi Associates Inc. 
 "For a few seconds it looked like 'buy the rumor, sell the fact.' But then the Dow came back up and it's hard to find any index doing anything spectacular," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. 
 "It's a Dow-inspired rally...because of the liquidity factor, visibility and safety," he added.

 The company cited two orders from U.S. semiconductor manufacturers for its recently introduced Model 5200GHR PanelPrinter in this year's fourth quarter. 
 Although it plans to ease away from courting a merger partner, the company said it will continue to consider forging relationships with two or more beta-site users for the company's new Model 70000 PanelPrinter.

 USA: FDA action on Lilly's Zyprexa seen imminent. 
 FDA action on Lilly's Zyprexa seen imminent. 
 Kevin Drawbaugh 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 
 
 Approval of Eli Lilly & Co's new anti-schizophrenia drug, Zyprexa, is expected to come soon from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, analysts said. 
 Marketing clearance for the drug, known generically as olanzapine, would put Lilly in the front of a parade of new anti-schizophrenia medications coming on the U.S. market. 
 "We expect approval yet this year ... There's been no hint of any issues" from the FDA that might cause delay, said Lilly spokesman Edward West. 
 Wall Street analysts said approval could come this month.   
 The FDA has not scheduled an advisory committee hearing for Zyprexa. West said Lilly has no indication that a committee hearing will be set. Analysts said the drug likely will be cleared without committee deliberations. 
 "The big expectation would be that Zyprexa will be approved ... That's what's on everybody's radar screen," said Smith Barney pharmaceuticals analyst Christina Heuer. 
 Zyprexa received a positive opinion in June from the European Union's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. European marketing approval likely will follow, analysts said. 
 Several competing products are in the pipeline.   
 Close behind Lilly are Abbott Laboratories Inc with Serlect, Zeneca Group Plc with Seroquel and Pfizer Inc with Ziprasidone. All are expected to hit the market within the next 12 months. 
 Already on the market are Johnson & Johnson's Risperdal, Sandoz AG's Clozaril and the benchmark treatment available since 1967, haloperidol, as well as a host of less frequently prescribed drugs. 
 Studies have shown that one in 100 people is schizophrenic. Estimates of the annual U.S. market for treating the disease range from $1 billion to $4.5 billion. 
 Looking at the huge success of Lilly's Prozac in treating clinical depression, drugmakers are hoping to score equally impressive wins with the new anti-schizophrenics.

 USA: NY precious metals end steady, Fed makes no move. 
 NY precious metals end steady, Fed makes no move. 
 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended little changed Tuesday, after news at the close the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at its latest Open Market Committee Meeting, as expected. 
 "The Fed's move to keep monetary policy unchanged was expected, but most precious metals have been basing recently, after the slide earlier in the year, with most players now perhaps a bit too complacent about the lack of volatility," Paine Webber analyst Bernard Savaiko said. 
 "The U.S. elections later this year, or signs of inflation, could still cause a breakout," he said.   
 "Few were expecting silver's break out from a two month range Monday, but silver held it's gains today, with a test of further resistance around $5.28 now possible," he said. 
 COMEX September silver ended unchanged at $5.21 an ounce after trading in a $5.170-5.230 range, on total estimated volume of 22,000 lots. 
 "Silver was getting too cheap relative to gold with the gold/silver ratio up around 76 or 77 recently," he said. 
 The jump in silver prices Monday to two month highs lowered the ratio to back to 74.2. 
 "The approaching first delivery date for the September COMEX contract, which still has some 270 million ounces of open interest, may have provided some incentive to go long," one analyst said. 
 COMEX December gold ended up $0.50 an ounce at $392.90, after trading in a narrow $392.20-393.00 range. 
 On the charts, gold's uptrend since late June still looks intact, traders said, but the rally's momentum has waned and further gains may just prompt more producer hedging. 
 Bullion was quoted $387.50/388.00 in New York near the close, from $387.10 at the London afternoon fix, and a New York close Monday at $386.90/387.40. 
 "The reduced probability that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy ahead of the November presidential elections should help keep gold prices steady until end user demand begins to improve again," Smith Barney analyst David Rinehimer said. 
 The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting (FOMC) is due on September 24. 
 NYMEX October platinum ended up $1.10 an ounce at $404.10, while NYMEX September palladium closed up $1.50 an ounce at $127.25. 
 "Support in palladium seems to be forming at $124 and is not likely to be penetrated near term," one analyst said. 
 Palladium slid to two and a half year lows last week. 
 "The large open interest in the September NYMEX price could lead prices to push back to $130-136 in the next two weeks."

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 Physical electricity prices for next-day delivery in the western U.S. were firm Tuesday, but power for deferred month deliveries were traded mostly lower, brokers and marketers said. 
 Next-day prices were bolstered by Bonneville Power Administration raising its posting for 16-hour power blocks for Wednesday delivery by two dollars to $17.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), market sources said. 
 Deferred month values were weaker amid a second-day of active selling, they said. "People are seeing these outer months are well overvalued," said a Houston trader. 
 A substantial decline in the natural gas market also pressured electricity prices lower, traders said. 
 NYMEX September Gulf Coast natgas futures were in the $2.060 area, off more than 12 cents per million British thermal units. 
 In the physical market, California-Oregon Border (COB) prices for firm, peak delivery were quoted at $16.00-$17.00 per MWh, up from Monday's $15.00-$16.00, market sources said. 
 September COB power for firm, peak delivery was assessed at $17.10-$17.90, up from Monday's $17.00-$17.40 range. 
 October COB, with similar delivery terms, was pegged at $15.50-$15.90, down from $15.75-$16.60 on Monday. Firm, peak COB for the 1996 fourth-quarter was valued at $16.90-$17.25, flat from Monday. 
 At the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) point in Washington, firm, peak electricity prices for next-day delivery were quoted at $15.00-$15.50 per MWh, up from Monday's $14.50-$15.50. 
 September Mid-C electricity was pegged at $16.50-$17.10, down slightly from Monday's $16.50-$17.20. 
 Down at the Palo Verde (PV) switchyard near Phoenix, Ariz., next-day power for peak, firm delivery was valued at $21.00-$22.00 per MWh, near unchanged from Monday's range. 
 September firm, peak PV electricity was quoted at $20.75-$21.25, flat from Monday. 
 October PV electricity, with similary delivery terms, was assessed at $15.90-$16.10. Fourth-quarter PV prices was quoted at $16.30-$16.70, down from Monday's $16.90-$17.25 range. 
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co continued to hold power output from its 2,160 MW Diablo Canyon nuclear power facility at 75 percent of capacity because of a nearby wildfire in the Los Padres national forest.

 USA: US fast food chains see little minimum wage impact. 
 US fast food chains see little minimum wage impact. 
 Patricia Commins 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 
 
 A 90-cent increase in the U.S. minimum wage will have little short-term impact on most fast food restaurants, since the competition for workers is keeping pay rates above the federally mandated standard. 
 "The (real) 'minimum wage' is what the closest McDonald's pays or it could be the local Pizza Hut," George Goulson, senior vice president of A&W Restaurants Inc, said. 
 But longer term, the industry fears that workers, who are already making more than the new minimum wage, will be looking for a raise to maintain the pay premium.   
 Earlier Tuesday, President Clinton signed into law the first rise in the minimum wage in five years, boosting the wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25. 
 "Our average crew wage is about $5.20 (an hour) so short-term there is not going to be any impact," said Denny Lynch, spokesman for Wendy's International Inc, which operates 4,307 restaurants in the United States. 
 But higher minimum wages will raise total wages by about $500,000 over the next 12 months at American Restaurant Partners L.P., which operates 62 Pizza Hut restaurant franchises.   
 "If you raise someone who started in the last two months (to the new minimum wage level), you also have to raise everybody else," said Terry Freund, chief financial officer of American Restaurant Partners. 
 Beyond the minimum wage requirements, competition for workers, from cooks to delivery drivers, has forced many fast-food chains to pay up to hire good help, particularly in metropolitan markets. That competition is being driven by an increase in restaurant openings. 
 "There are neighborhoods where we have to pay $6.00 an hour to $6.50 or $7.00 to get" good workers, Lynch added.   
 Fast-food industry executives said there has been competition for workers since the late 1980s, although the increase in restaurant openings is making the search for employees more intense. 
 Another problem for quick-service restaurants is that wage competition from other employers often lures experienced workers away. A fast-food worker, for example, may be able to bring home more pay as a waiter or waitress at a casual dining establishment where they could receive $50 or $60 a night in tips, executives said. 
 "For QSRs (quick service restaurants)...it's even tougher to keep the kids," Roger Lipton, president of Lipton Financial Services, said.

 USA: U.S. debt futures finish mixed after FOMC meeting. 
 U.S. debt futures finish mixed after FOMC meeting. 
 CHICAGO 1996-08-20 
 
 U.S. debt futures finished mixed, with the short end settling near the day's highs, while the long end wrapped up a light, lackluster session on the defensive, traders and analysts said. 
 However, both U.S. T-bond and Eurodollar futures are seen inching up slightly in the near term after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its much-awaited meeting without raising rates. 
 U.S. Septmeber bonds set a session low of 110-23/32 in a knee-jerk reaction to the FOMC's announcement that there was no change in the U.S. monetary policy.   
 Several traders said one firm sold 7,000 September bond contracts after the FOMC announcement, which helped pressure the contract through the day's previous low of 110-27/32. 
 "They just loaded up the pit with supply," one floor source said. 
 The contract traded inside Monday's range of 111-13/32 to 110-24/32 for most of the day, and most contracts closed only 01/32 lower. 
 "That doesn't exactly lead me to expect much in the way of price action on Wednesday," one trader said.   
 "Between now and then, there is not much to change things," said John Nyhoff, vice president and economist of Mitsubishi Financial Futures. 
 Nyhoff expects Eurodollars to rise slightly, with December climbing to the 94.50 area. 
 On Wednesday, July import and export prices will be released at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT and the July federal budget will be released at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT.   
 At the end of pit trade, September T-bonds were down 01/32 to 110-28/32, 10-year notes were flat at 108-19/32, munibonds rose 05/32 to 115-09/32, December Eurodollars were up one basis point at 94.21 and March Eurodollars were also up a basis point at 94.11, while March T-bills were one point higher at 94.69.

 The Sands Regent said Tuesday it filed a lawsuit against the Mississippi Port Authority and the Mississippi Department of Economic Development, because they refused to give Copa clearance to expand its casino operations in Gulfport, Mississippi. 
 The suit also comes in response to recent notifications by the authority and the development group that Copa must vacate its casino site when its lease expires in October 1999. 
 In its suit, filed in Circuit Court in Harrison County, Mississippi, Sands alleges failure to deal in good faith, breach of contract and misrepresentation.   
 Sands Regent said Copa had wanted to build a hotel near the site and bring in a casino barge to replace or supplement the current casino vessel. 
 Copa is asking for monetary damages and declaratory relief giving them the right to build the hotel and bring in a new barge. 
 The Port Authority has said it needs the location to expand shipping and related commercials activitie, according to Sands Regent.

 USA: Novell takes on Intranet market. 
 Novell takes on Intranet market. 
 Barbara Grady 
 BURLINGAME, Calif 1996-08-20 
 
 Novell Inc, saying its future growth and survival is at stake, launched an aggressive push into the Intranet market by introducing IntranetWare, a network platform adapted from Novell's NetWare network operating system to fully open standards for operating corporate Intranets. 
 The Orem, Utah software company has been the leading vendor of network operating system platform. But its NetWare has a history as a proprietary system, although Novell has made revisions to gradually open it to standards compliant.   
 Consequently, Novell has been perceived in the market as out-of-the-loop as the tide of corporate interest in developing Internet-like Intranets has swept through the business world this year. 
 "Fundamentally our future is at stake here," said Novell executive vice president Steven Markman when asked the importance of IntranetWare's launch to Novell's strategy. "If we are looking for growth, the only way we are going to get it is with open standards, Internet-Intranet based network services tied to network services," he said. "This is survival, it is fundamental."   
 With IntranetWare, which will be generally available in October, Novell will be shipping a whole series of Intranet applications and network management tools, including a NetWare Web server, a fast server which integrates Novell's existing Directory Services product, GroupWise 5.0 a messaging and collaboration application, and ManageWise 2.1 an Intranet network management solution. 
 Executives demonstrating the products at a press conference here said they hope to convince the market that IntranetWare and its associated products combine the reliability, robustness and security features of the old NetWare platform with the open easy-to-access features of an Intranet.   
 NetWare has about 55 million users and has been a market leader among corporate networking platforms. 
 But analysts have said Novell stood to lose that distinction if it did not move into the Intranet direction. 
 International Data Corp analyst Mark Levitt said Novell would face too much of a risk if it did not answer the market demand for Intranet products. 
 Indeed, Markman said many customers have asked Novell to make its network products Intranet based. 
 The question remains, however, whether or not Novell launched its Intranet strategy and products soon enough.   
 Some analysts said Novell customers have had to wait a year for direction from Novell about how to migrate from NetWare to an Intranet network and relied on others meanwhile. 
 "The market is ripe for Intranet solutions and I think they've hit the needs right on. People are going to be more accepting of an Intranet solution from a company with a large installed base like Novell," said Ron Rappaport, research associate at Zona Research. 
 "The question is are they late." 
 Markman maintained that Novell is not late, saying that customers are just now figuring out what Intranets are.

 NEW YORK 1996-08-20 
 
 U.S. Mid-Atlantic spot electricity was trading steady for short-term deals and lower in longer-term trade with below-normal temperatures expected through the region by next week, industry sources said. 
 "Next week is coming off pretty good, the six-to-ten day forecast is calling for cooler weather," said one broker. 
 Prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) power pool for next day, on peak delivery were discussed relatively steady in the $29.00-31.00 range from $27.00-31.00 on Monday. 
 The next day prices were holding at levels above those seen last week. 
 "The weather is probably a factor, we are seeing some pretty good loads today," said one trader, adding "the prices we are seeing are still low compared to what we would see if we broke the 90s (degrees Fahrenheit)." 
 Off-peak next day power was talked at $15.50-17.00. 
 PJM power for firm, peak delivery for the three remaining days of this week was talked lower in the $28.00-29.00 range from $28.50-31.00 range on Monday, the industry sources said. 
 Power for the five business days of next week was discussed lower at $24.75-25.50 from a range of $25.75-28.00 per megawatt hour on Monday, the brokers and marketers said. 
 September PJM power, also for firm, peak delivery, dipped in early trade and rebounded slightly to afternoon discussion at $22.20-22.75 with $22.50 said to have traded, although the trade was unconfirmed. 
 September PJM was talked at $23.00-23.50 on Monday. 
 October PJM electricity with similar delivery terms was quoted at $20.00-20.65 from $20.20-20.70 on Monday, while November was pegged in the $21.50-22.00 range from $21.60-21.90 on Monday. 
 December PJM was assessed at $25.00-25.75, while fourth quarter PJM was talked near $22.25-22.75, the sources said.

 Some traders tied the firming, which briefly tugged most currencies to the day's peaks, to "buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact" activities vis-a-vis the dollar. 
 "I'm surprised as well...but there must have been a small amount of insurance (dollar) buying before the meeting," said Chris Turner, currency strategist, IDEA Inc. 
 He said those "just-in-case" long-dollar positions likely were unwound when the Fed took no action.   
 "When the FOMC was over, the dollar went offered," said a floor broker at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. "But when the Redbook hit the street, the dollar rallied." 
 Retail sales rose 1.2 percent in the first two weeks of August versus July, according to Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc Redbook retail sales index. 
 Focus shifted to Wednesday's IFO business climate survey for softness that might bolster arguments for a German cut. 
 But Turner said the currency market likely already had factored in any weakness in the German business survey during last week's dollar rally to 1.4950 from 1.4750 marks.   
 Turner also said his firm did not look for a German ease until the Bundesbank sees more months of evidence that M3 growth has slowed to within its four-percent to seven-percent target corridor. 
 Other pundits, however, said slowing in July M3 growth to an 8.6-percent rate fueled expectations the Bundesbank will cut its 3.30-percent repo rate at Thursday's council meeting. 
 Yen fell early after Japan ministry of finance senior official Eisuke Sakakibara was quoted as saying that even a dollar rise above 110.00 yen would have only a small chance of having an adverse effect on the Japanese economy.   
 Currencies dipped early in the session after a smaller-than-expected June U.S. trade deficit. The trade gap shrank 23.1 percent to $8.11 billion against forecasts for a $9.4-billion shortfall. 
 At settlement, September yen fell $0.000050 to $0.009261, marks eased $0.0004 to $0.6728, Swiss francs firmed $0.0009 to $0.8313, Sterling gained $0.0032 to $1.5476, Canadian dollar slipped $0.0001 to $0.7288, Australian dollar lost $0.0041 to $0.7854, and the Mexican peso rose $0.000350 to $0.131875.
