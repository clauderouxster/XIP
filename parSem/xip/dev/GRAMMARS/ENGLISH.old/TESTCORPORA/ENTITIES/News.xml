  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>IRAQ</LOCORG_COUNTRY>

  <ORGANISATION>THE HERALD TRIBUNE</ORGANISATION>

The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> presented a draft
  <ORGANISATION> UN</ORGANISATION> resolution Monday that calls for a full transfer of sovereignty to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and an initial one-year mandate for the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led multinational military force, subject to the consent of the transitional government.
.
"The
  <ORGANISATION> interim Iraqi government</ORGANISATION> will assume total responsibility for its own sovereignty," the British ambassador,
  <PERSON> Sir Emyr Jones Parry</PERSON>, said before a closed-door
  <ORGANISATION> Security Council</ORGANISATION> session called to review the proposal. That government is to take office by
  <DATE> June 30</DATE>. The text drew mostly positive comments among ambassadors in the corridors outside the conference room, and was expected to lead fairly quickly to the passage of a resolution. But the timetable from now to
  <DATE> June 30</DATE>, when the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has promised to hand over additional powers to Iraqis, remains tight, troubled and uncertain. "We are definitely running out of time," said
  <PERSON>   Ambassador Abdallah Baali of Algeria</PERSON>, a council member. "There is no room for error. Not anymore."
.
The draft was presented hours before
  <PERSON> President George W. Bush </PERSON>- whose approval ratings have continued to decline, according to a new poll released Tuesday - was to launch a parallel effort aimed at reassuring Americans and drawing wider international backing for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S. </LOCORG_COUNTRY>efforts in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. A major prime-time speech Monday was to be the first of six such addresses planned. The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has agreed to leave it largely to a special
  <ORGANISATION> UN</ORGANISATION> envoy,
  <PERSON> Lakhdar Brahimi</PERSON>, to name leaders of an interim government, though a
  <PERSON> Brahimi</PERSON> spokesman said Monday that he might not make his
  <DATE> May 31</DATE> deadline. Still, after weeks of intensive negotiations, the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> said they had achieved near-consensus among fellow
  <ORGANISATION> Security Council</ORGANISATION> members.
.
Even
  <PERSON> Ambassador Gunter Pleuger of Germany</PERSON>, whose country ardently opposed the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> war, called the draft text "a good basis for discussions" toward a resolution that will "make clear that we have a new start in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>."
.
The draft endorses plans for direct democratic elections to be held by the end of this year "if possible, and in no case later than 
  <DATE>31 January 2005</DATE>." The national assembly thereby elected will have responsibility for drafting a permanent constitution that will permit elections for a permanent government. The text also calls for lifting the arms embargo against
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. A broadly supported
  <ORGANISATION> UN</ORGANISATION> resolution would represent a significant mending of the bitter breach that developed over the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led march to war. It would also signal a striking new acceptance by the
  <ORGANISATION> U.S. administration</ORGANISATION>, as it struggles to retake the initiative after weeks of bruising setbacks, of the importance of the world body. The coming period could prove crucial to the administration's hopes for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, and possibly also to
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>'s prospects for re-election. His job approval rankings have declined steadily for weeks. A new
  <ORGANISATION> CBS News</ORGANISATION> poll found that 41 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing as president, down 3 percentage points in two weeks, and far below the 66 percent who approved a year earlier. Fifty-two percent disapproved of his overall performance in the latest poll, and 61 percent disapproved of his handling of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. With worries over
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> growing, 65 percent of those polled said that the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was on the wrong track, equaling the highest number the poll has recorded since it began asking the question nearly 20 years ago. Republicans have not hidden their mounting concerns over
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>'s poll numbers; no recent president with such ratings at this point in his presidency was re-elected. In an effort to retake the initiative,
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> planned in his speech to express a firm determination not to be chased from
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> by the recent chaos, scandal and violence, but also an intent to shift growing levels of responsibility to Iraqis at the fastest reasonable pace, aides said. "We have two choices," said the
  <LOCORG> White House</LOCORG> press secretary,
  <PERSON> Scott McClellan</PERSON>, foreshadowing the themes of
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>'s speech. "We can work to build a free, democratic and peaceful
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, or we can let the terrorists prevail, but the terrorists will not prevail."
.
He said
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> would discuss
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> efforts in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> in five areas: political moves, the elections planned for January, security, reconstruction and diplomatic efforts. For weeks,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has worked closely with the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to write a broadly acceptable draft, and its ambassador to the
  <ORGANISATION> United Nations</ORGANISATION> emphasized that it envisions a full transfer of sovereignty.
.
"It underlines clearly that all sovereignty will be returned to the Iraqis, that the
  <ORGANISATION> interim Iraqi government</ORGANISATION> will assume total responsibility for its own sovereignty,"
  <PERSON> Sir Emyr</PERSON> said.
.
  <PERSON>McClellan</PERSON> also used the phrase "full sovereignty." But in a qualification that has left some confusion, he said it was only normal that, given its nonelected and temporary nature, the interim government would also have "limited authority."
.
The text reaffirms the
  <ORGANISATION> UN </ORGANISATION>authorization for the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led multinational force, but leaves it subject to review by the transitional government 12 months from the date a resolution is adopted. That force was created by a resolution in October.
  <PERSON> McClellan</PERSON> was asked Monday whether the multinational force would remain under
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> command - a matter not specifically addressed in the text, but one on which the administration has indicated it will not budge. "Yes, that's what I expect," he said. The text states that the multinational force "shall have authority to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> including by preventing and deterring terrorism."
.
But the
  <ORGANISATION> Iraqi government</ORGANISATION> would have the power to ask the multinational force to leave.
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> officials, including
  <PERSON> Secretary of State Colin Powell</PERSON>, recently said as much, while adding that they felt certain no such request would be forthcoming. The British ambassador noted that the draft called for the multinational force to remain in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> after
  <DATE> June 30 </DATE>"with the consent, in consultation and in partnership" with the caretaker government. The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> would retain control of Iraqi police and security forces, though they would answer directly to Iraqi commanders. The draft also states that the interim government would control the
  <ORGANISATION> Development Fund</ORGANISATION> for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, which includes
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s oil revenues.
  <PERSON> Brahimi</PERSON>, who has been working in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> since early this month to identify consensus leaders for the caretaker government, may be as much a week behind his
  <DATE> May 31</DATE> deadline, his spokesman,
  <PERSON> Ahmad Fawzi</PERSON>, told
  <ORGANISATION> Bloomberg News</ORGANISATION>.


  <ORGANISATION>THE GUARDIAN</ORGANISATION>

  <PERSON>George Bush</PERSON> tried last night to persuade an increasingly sceptical American public to rekindle its faith in his project for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, promising he had a clear strategy for a handover of power.

The speech was delivered at a time when
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> is facing approval ratings in the dangerous 40% range - the lowest of his presidency - and when some 64% of the public believe that he has no clear plan for bringing the situation in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to a successful resolution.

  <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> tried to shake off those doubts yesterday, telling an audience at the army war college in
  <LOCORG> Pennsylvania</LOCORG>: "History is moving, and it will tend toward hope or tend toward tragedy. We will persevere and defeat this enemy and hold this hard-won ground for the realm of liberty."

Yesterday's address coincided with a proposal by
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN> for a new
  <ORGANISATION> United Nations</ORGANISATION> resolution authorising the
  <DATE> June 30</DATE> handover of power in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led stabilisation force for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-British resolution calls for a caretaker administration - unelected and appointed by the
  <ORGANISATION> UN</ORGANISATION> - which will take office by
  <DATE> June 30</DATE> and govern until elections in approximately six months.

"The interim government of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> will assume the responsibility and authority for governing a sovereign
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>," it says.

The resolution also authorises a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led military force to stay in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> for at least a year. There is no clear timetable for the troops to leave.

  <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> lowered expectations by acknowledging that the coming five weeks will see a new eruption in violence, and that he may need to send more troops to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

"
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> now faces a critical moment. As the Iraqi people move closer to governing themselves, the terrorists are likely to become more active and more brutal," he said.

He appeared determined to regain control of the domestic political terrain in the run-up to next November's election.

  <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> reached out to try to reverse the steady erosion of public support for the war and occupation of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, pledging to demolish the notorious
  <LOCORG_CITY>   Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> prison, where naked and humiliated Iraqis were photographed by American army guards.

He also set out what he called a five-point plan for a handover in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, beginning with the transfer of power to an unelected
  <ORGANISATION> Iraqi government</ORGANISATION> on
  <DATE> June 30</DATE>, establishment of a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led protection force, campaign for broader international support, and reconstruction including elections to be held in six months.

"Completing the five steps to
  <ORGANISATION> Iraqi elected self-government</ORGANISATION> will not be easy,"
  <PERSON> Mr Bush </PERSON>said. "There is likely to be violence before the transfer of sovereignty and after the transfer of sovereignty."

Although
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> was more expansive on his vision for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> than he has been in previous appearances, the substance of his plan was still woefully thin, and was seen largely as a concerted effort by
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> to stop the erosion in support for his administration.

The Democratic challenger,
  <PERSON> John Kerry</PERSON>, has called on the
  <LOCORG> White House</LOCORG> to "turn words into action". However, last night's address is merely the first stage of what promises to be a dogged campaign by
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> to turn around public opinion on the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> war.

  <LOCORG>White House</LOCORG> aides have said he plans five more such speeches, one each week in the five weeks remaining until the
  <DATE> June 30</DATE> handover date.

With time running out on
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> - and
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> just five months away from his own electoral test - the consequences of his decision to go to war are becoming even more stark.

With the death toll among
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> forces in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> now approaching 800, and the
  <LOCORG_CITY>   Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> scandal producing almost daily revelations of fresh abuse,
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> is facing a steady erosion of support.

More alarming for
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON>, he is losing support among his fellow Republicans. A poll posted on the
  <ORGANISATION> Washington Post </ORGANISATION>website last night attributed virtually all of his seven point decline in his approval rating to disaffected Republicans.

  <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> also has the burden of defending his defence secretary,
  <PERSON> Donald Rumsfeld</PERSON>, for a second time since the first pictures of abuse at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> prison surfaced three weeks ago.

In a blistering appearance on
  <ORGANISATION> CBS television</ORGANISATION>'s 60 minutes on Sunday,
  <PERSON> General Anthony Zinni</PERSON>, a former commander of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> forces in the
  <LOCORG> Middle East</LOCORG>, lashed out at
  <PERSON> Mr Rumsfeld </PERSON>for bungling the war, and said he should be held accountable.

"Somebody screwed up. And at this level and at this stage, it should be evident to everybody that they've screwed up,"
  <PERSON> Mr Zinni</PERSON> said.

  <PERSON>Mr Zinni</PERSON>, who served
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> as an envoy to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and the Palestinians, broke ranks with the Administration before the war on
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. Like other military men, he has been severe in his criticism of
  <PERSON> Mr Rumsfeld</PERSON>'s post-war planning, which called for a far smaller military force than the generals had wanted.

In his new book, Battle Ready,
  <PERSON> Mr Zinni</PERSON> says the
  <ORGANISATION> Pentagon</ORGANISATION>'s civilian leadership betrayed "at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at worse, lying, incompetence and corruption" in the run-up to the war.


  <PERSON>President George W. Bush</PERSON> on Monday said
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s task in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was the creation of a "free, representative government", adding: "The sooner this goal is achieved, the sooner our job will be done".

With sliding support for the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US </LOCORG_COUNTRY>operation in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> putting his prospects of a second term in peril,
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> set out what
  <LOCORG> White House</LOCORG> officials called a "clear strategy" for success.

"We will persevere, and defeat this enemy, and hold this hard-won ground for the realm of liberty,"
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> said.

Speaking on the day the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> UK </LOCORG_COUNTRY>put forward a draft
  <ORGANISATION> United Nations</ORGANISATION> resolution that would endorse an
  <ORGANISATION> interim Iraqi government</ORGANISATION> by the end of June, the president sought to dispel the growing impression of a listless
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led effort drifting out of control.

"There are five steps in our plan to help
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> achieve democracy and freedom,"
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> said. "We will hand over authority to a
  <ORGANISATION> sovereign Iraqi government</ORGANISATION>, help establish security, continue rebuilding
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s infrastructure, encourage more international support and move toward a national election that will bring forward new leaders empowered by the Iraqi people."

In his prime-time speech to the
  <LOCORG> Army War College</LOCORG> in
  <LOCORG> Pennsylvania</LOCORG>,
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> also announced the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> would seek to demolish the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> prison, the scene of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> torture of Iraqi detainees. The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> will fund the construction of a new maximum security prison and, when that is completed and with the approval of the
  <ORGANISATION> Iraqi government</ORGANISATION>, "we will demolish the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> prison as a fitting symbol of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s new beginning,"
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> said, stumbling over the pronunciation of the prison's name.

  <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> also emphasised the effort to improve the training of 260,000 Iraqi soldiers, police and security personnel. He said
  <PERSON> James Baker</PERSON>, former secretary of state, had successfully negotiated with several Iraqi creditor nations to forgive or reduce
  <PERSON> Saddam Hussein</PERSON>-era debts.

A
  <ORGANISATION> CBS </ORGANISATION>poll out on Monday showed 41 per cent of people surveyed approved of the job
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> is doing as president, while 52 per cent disapproved - the lowest level of his presidency. A
  <ORGANISATION> Washington Post</ORGANISATION>-
  <ORGANISATION>ABC News</ORGANISATION> poll also showed
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON>'s approval rating at the lowest level since he took office: a 47 per cent approval rating and just four out of 10 people approving of his handling of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

  <PERSON>Mr Bush</PERSON> resisted the growing pressure to set a date for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> troop withdrawal, instead saying that if
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> commanders need more soldiers, he would send them.

The numbers of people who favour troop withdrawal are also edging up - 40 per cent want the troops brought home, up 7 percentage points from last month - and the numbers supporting a stay-the-course strategy are slipping to 58 per cent from 66 per cent last month.

Just over a month before the handover of authority to what he insisted would be "full sovereignty" for the Iraqis, the president said the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> aim in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was "not only to defeat an enemy, it is to give strength to a friend - a free, representative government that serves its people and fights on their behalf. And the sooner this goal is achieved, the sooner our job will be done."

  
  <ORGANISATION>THE GUARDIAN</ORGANISATION>
 Strong
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> allies
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Australia </LOCORG_COUNTRY>and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> praised
  <LOCORG> Washington</LOCORG>'s latest moves on
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, with
  <LOCORG_CITY> Canberra</LOCORG_CITY> welcoming
  <PERSON> President Bush</PERSON>'s pledge to stay in the country until it is democratic and
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tokyo</LOCORG_CITY> commending moves to seek a
  <ORGANISATION> U.N.</ORGANISATION> mandate for international troops there.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>China</LOCORG_COUNTRY> urged the early establishment of a new
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> with ``political sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,'' but said it too supported the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-British draft resolution on post-occupation
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> introduced Monday to the
  <ORGANISATION> U.N. Security Council</ORGANISATION>.

The resolution authorizes a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led multinational force to maintain security using ``all necessary measures.'' A key issue is whether sovereignty would really be restored after the
  <DATE> June 30</DATE> handover of power.

Later Monday in a nationally televised address,
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> outlined his vision for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> following the planned handover of sovereignty to its people next month.

  <PERSON>Chinese Foreign Minister spokesman Liu Jianchao</PERSON> said his government will take part in
  <ORGANISATION> U.N.</ORGANISATION> consideration of the resolution ``with a positive and constructive attitude.'' He said
  <LOCORG_CITY> Beijing</LOCORG_CITY> had submitted a proposal outlining the Chinese position, including the need to improve the security of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and restore peace at an early date.

  <PERSON>Liu </PERSON>also said it was ``too premature'' to discuss whether
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> China</LOCORG_COUNTRY> would contribute troops to the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led multinational force.

  <PERSON>Australia's Prime Minister John Howard</PERSON> said he welcomed the
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>'s pledge, adding that Australian troops would remain in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq </LOCORG_COUNTRY>even though opinion polls showed support for the deployment was slipping.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Australia</LOCORG_COUNTRY> sent 2,000 troops to take part in the invasion of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq </LOCORG_COUNTRY>and still has 850 military personnel in and around the country.

``This government has absolutely no intention of altering our position in relation to being part of the coalition in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,''
  <PERSON> Howard</PERSON> told parliament. ``We did not enter the coalition on the basis of opinion polls last year ... and we have absolutely no intention on the basis of opinion polls of altering our position at the present time.''

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> welcomed the draft resolution and said it looked forward to cooperating with other countries to help rebuild
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. It made no mention of sending more troops.

``We hope a new resolution will be adopted to guarantee the reconstruction of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> by Iraqis,''
  <PERSON> Hosoda</PERSON> said. ``We would like to work closely with other countries.''

  <LOCORG_CITY>Tokyo</LOCORG_CITY> has long advocated more
  <ORGANISATION> U.N.</ORGANISATION> involvement in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, which would lift public backing for
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tokyo</LOCORG_CITY>'s dispatch of troops to the southern part of the country.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has sent about 550 ground troops to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq </LOCORG_COUNTRY>and hundreds more air and naval forces to the region on a humanitarian mission to support the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-led coalition.

The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> will need to negotiate with longtime critics of the Iraq war, such as
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France </LOCORG_COUNTRY>and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, on the resolution. Both
  <LOCORG_CITY> Paris</LOCORG_CITY> and
  <LOCORG_CITY> Berlin</LOCORG_CITY> are demanding a greater role for
  <ORGANISATION> Iraq's interim government</ORGANISATION> in security issues.

Japanese and South Korean media, meanwhile, said
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>'s speech appeared aimed at bolstering support both at home and abroad after the prisoner abuse scandal at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY>.

  <ORGANISATION>South Korea's Yonhap news agency</ORGANISATION> said in an analysis piece that
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>'s proposal to demolish
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> prison could be interpreted as a ``political show'' and said it was unclear how much this would help repair impressions of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> soldiers.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Japan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s public broadcaster said the plan to destroy the prison appeared to be part of an effort to improve
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s image in the wake of the abuses of Iraqi inmates by
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> soldiers at the facility.

  <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> said the prison that was a symbol of death and torture under
  <PERSON> Saddam Hussein</PERSON> ``became a symbol of disgraceful conduct by a few American troops who dishonored our country and disregarded our values.''

He said the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> would pay to demolish the prison and build a new one.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>South Korea</LOCORG_COUNTRY> already has 600 military medics and engineers in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

It decided earlier this year to send 3,600 South Korean troops to replace them as early as April, but the mission has been twice delayed and the government does not know when and where in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> they will be stationed. Many South Koreans oppose the plan because of growing violence there. 


  <ORGANISATION>THE GUARDIAN</ORGANISATION>

A group led by
  <PERSON> al-Qaida figure Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</PERSON> is claiming responsibility for the bomb attack that killed the head of the <ORGANISATION>Iraqi governing council</ORGANISATION> on Monday, according to a statement on the internet.

The Arabic-language statement, signed by
  <ORGANISATION> Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad</ORGANISATION> ("
  <ORGANISATION>Monotheism and Jihad Group</ORGANISATION>"), appeared on a website known for militant Islamic messages, though its authenticity could not be immediately verified.

The group said a Saudi named
  <PERSON> Abu Salama al-Hejazi</PERSON> carried out the bombing but did not indicate whether it was a suicide attack.

  <PERSON>Izzedin Salim</PERSON>, who had taken over the rotating presidency of the governing council this month, died along with 10 other Iraqis while waiting in his car at a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> checkpoint in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Baghdad</LOCORG_CITY>.

He was the second and most senior member of the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-appointed council to be assassinated and his death came at a critical time for
  <LOCORG> Washington</LOCORG> as it tries to improve security ahead of the transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis on
  <DATE> June 30</DATE>.

Praising the attack, the internet statement said: "Another lion from the
  <ORGANISATION> Monotheism and Jihad Group</ORGANISATION> has removed one of the rotten heads of those who betray God and sell their religion to the Americans and their allies.

"This operation announces to Muslims everywhere that the mojahedin, with their people in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, are continuing and determined to lift the humiliation from our nation."

Other members of the
  <ORGANISATION> Iraqi governing council</ORGANISATION> could meet the same fate as
  <PERSON> Mr Salim</PERSON>, the statement added.

  <PERSON>Brig Gen Mark Kimmitt</PERSON>, the chief military spokesman in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, initially said that Monday's car bombing had the "classic hallmarks" of
  <PERSON> Zarqawi</PERSON>. He later suggested others might be to blame "because of methodology in some of the techniques that were used".

A group calling itself "
  <ORGANISATION>Arab Resistance Group - al-Rashid Brigades</ORGANISATION>", said on Monday that it killed
  <PERSON> Mr Salim</PERSON>.

  <PERSON>Mr Zarqawi</PERSON>, a Jordanian who fought in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Afghanistan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, is wanted by the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> for allegedly organising
  <ORGANISATION> al-Qaida</ORGANISATION> activities in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and a $10m (£5.6m) reward for his capture is on offer.

His group is thought to have carried out the videotaped beheading of
  <PERSON> Nicholas Berg</PERSON>, the American civilian found dead in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> this month.

  <PERSON>Zarqawi</PERSON> has previously claimed responsibility for two of the worst attacks in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>: the truck bombing of the
  <ORGANISATION> UN</ORGANISATION> headquarters last August and the car bombing in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Najaf</LOCORG_CITY> in the same month that killed
  <PERSON> Ayatollah Mohammed Baqer al-Hakim</PERSON>, a leading Shia figure, along with at least 82 others.

He has also claimed a suicide boat attack on
  <LOCORG_CITY> Basra</LOCORG_CITY> oil terminal which killed at least three
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> sailors on
  <DATE> April 24</DATE> and a suicide car bomb outside the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> headquarters in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Baghdad</LOCORG_CITY> which killed at least five Iraqis and a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> soldier on
  <DATE> May 6</DATE>. 

  <ORGANISATION>THE GUARDIAN</ORGANISATION>

The
  <ORGANISATION> Bush administration</ORGANISATION> tried to erase the recent shameful images of postwar
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> last night by saying it would demolish
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> prison, and discipline its commander.

In a statement from the
  <LOCORG> White House</LOCORG>, a few hours before
  <PERSON> George Bush</PERSON>'s speech early today, the administration said that the demolition of the prison would symbolise a new beginning for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. "Under
  <PERSON> Saddam Hussein</PERSON>, prisons like
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> were symbols of death and torture. That same prison became a symbol of disgraceful conduct by a few American troops who dishonoured our country and disregarded our values," it said.

The directive concludes a debate on the future of the jail that had been raging since the first images appeared three weeks ago of cowering, naked Iraqi prisoners and their taunting American army guards.

Some had argued that
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY>, stained by its history under
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON>, should have been destroyed as soon as the war had ended. Now, it appears the
  <ORGANISATION> Bush administration</ORGANISATION> has come to that same view.

The statement said the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> would help finance the construction of a new maximum security prison.

Inmates would be transferred to the new building. "Then, with the approval of the
  <ORGANISATION> Iraqi government</ORGANISATION>, we will demolish the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib </LOCORG_CITY>prison as a fitting symbol of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s new beginning."

The army announced that the general in charge of prisons when the abuse took place had been suspended, and removed from active duty.

  <PERSON>Brigadier General Janis Karpinski</PERSON>, commander of the 800th military police brigade, was severely criticised in the army's investigation of the abuse. She was accused of failing to enforce standards among the soldiers under her command, and of rarely visiting the prison.

  <PERSON>Gen Karpinski</PERSON> says she was overruled by higher-ranking officers on decisions to give tactical control of the prison to military intelligence. It remains unclear whether she will face criminal charges. A spokesman said the matter was "under review".


BIOGRAPHIES

  <PERSON>TONY BLAIR</PERSON>
The son of a barrister and lecturer,
  <PERSON> Tony Blair</PERSON> was born in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Edinburgh</LOCORG_CITY>, but spent most of his childhood in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Durham</LOCORG_CITY>. At the age of 14 he returned to
  <LOCORG_CITY> Edinburgh</LOCORG_CITY> to finish his education at
  <LOCORG> Fettes College</LOCORG>. He studied law at
  <LOCORG_CITY>   Oxford</LOCORG_CITY>, and went on to become a barrister himself.

After standing unsuccessfully for the
  <ORGANISATION> Labour Party </ORGANISATION>in a by-election,
  <PERSON> Blair</PERSON> went on to win the seat of
  <LOCORG> Sedgefield</LOCORG> in the
  <DATE> 1983</DATE> General Election, aged 30.

  <PERSON>Tony Blair</PERSON> made a speedy rise through the ranks, being promoted first to the shadow Treasury front bench in
  <DATE> 1984</DATE>. He subsequently served as a trade and industry spokesman, before being elected to the Shadow Cabinet in
  <DATE> 1988</DATE> where he was made Shadow Secretary of State for Energy. In
  <DATE> 1989</DATE> he moved to the employment brief.

After the
  <DATE> 1992</DATE> election Labour's new leader,
  <PERSON> John Smith</PERSON>, promoted
  <PERSON> Blair</PERSON> to Shadow Home Secretary. It was in this post that
  <PERSON> Blair</PERSON> made famous his pledge that Labour would be tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.

  <PERSON>John Smith</PERSON> died suddenly and unexpectedly in
  <DATE> 1994</DATE>, and in the subsequent leadership contest
  <PERSON> Tony Blair</PERSON> won a large majority of his party's support.

  <PERSON>Blair</PERSON> immediately launched his campaign for the modernisation of the
  <ORGANISATION> Labour Party</ORGANISATION>, determined to complete the shift further towards the political centre which he saw as essential for victory. The debate over Clause 4 of the party's constitution was considered the crucial test of whether its members would commit to
  <PERSON> Blair</PERSON>'s project. He removed the commitment to public ownership, and at this time coined the term New Labour.

The
  <ORGANISATION> Labour Party</ORGANISATION> won the
  <DATE> 1997</DATE> General Election by a landslide, after 18 years in Opposition. At the age of 43 ,
  <PERSON> Tony Blair</PERSON> became the youngest Prime Minister since
  <PERSON> Lord Liverpool</PERSON> in
  <DATE> 1812</DATE>.

The government began to implement a far-reaching programme of constitutional change, putting the question of devolution to referendums in
  <LOCORG> Scotland</LOCORG> and
  <LOCORG> Wales</LOCORG>.

An elected post of Mayor of
  <LOCORG_CITY> London</LOCORG_CITY> was established at the head of a new capital-wide authority, and all but 92 hereditary peers were removed from the
  <LOCORG> House of Lords</LOCORG> in the first stage of its reform. The government has also implemented an investment programme of £42 billion in its priority areas of health and education.

  <PERSON>Tony Blair</PERSON> was re-elected with another landslide majority in the
  <DATE> 2001</DATE> General Election.

He is married to the 
  <PERSON>barrister Cherie Booth QC</PERSON>, and they have four children. Their youngest,
  <PERSON> Leo</PERSON>, was the first child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years.


  <PERSON>JOHN MAJOR</PERSON>
  <PERSON>John Major</PERSON> grew up in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Brixton</LOCORG_CITY>, and was educated at his local grammar school. He left school aged 16, and worked for
  <LOCORG> Standard Chartered Bank</LOCORG> before entering politics.

His political career began as a Conservative councillor in the
  <LOCORG_CITY> London</LOCORG_CITY> borough of
  <LOCORG> Lambeth</LOCORG>, and continued when he won the constituency of
  <LOCORG> Huntingdon</LOCORG> for the Conservatives in
  <DATE> 1979</DATE>, at the election which brought his predecessor,
  <PERSON> Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>, to power.

He served in junior posts in the <LOCORG>Home Office</LOCORG> and the <LOCORG>Whips Office</LOCORG> and was Minister of State at the <ORGANISATION>Department of Social Security</ORGANISATION> before being appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury in
  <DATE> 1987</DATE>. There he served under the then Chancellor,
  <PERSON> Nigel Lawson</PERSON>.

In the summer of
  <DATE> 1989</DATE>
  <PERSON> John Major</PERSON> became Foreign Secretary after
  <PERSON> Geoffrey Howe</PERSON> was moved from the <ORGANISATION>Foreign Office</ORGANISATION> to become Leader of the
  <LOCORG> House of Commons</LOCORG> and Deputy Prime Minister.
  <PERSON> Major</PERSON> became Chancellor of the Exchequer less than 100 days later when
  <PERSON> Nigel Lawson</PERSON> dramatically resigned. It was during
  <PERSON> Major</PERSON>'s tenure at the Treasury that
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain </LOCORG_COUNTRY>joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in
  <DATE> October 1990</DATE>.

  <PERSON>Thatcher</PERSON>'s leadership at this time was under increasing pressure, and when she was challenged,
  <PERSON> John Major</PERSON> supported her in the leadership election of
  <DATE> November 1990</DATE>. When she stepped down,
  <PERSON> Major</PERSON> entered the contest himself, and with
  <PERSON> Thatcher</PERSON>'s support he went on to beat
  <PERSON> Michael Heseltine</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Douglas Hurd</PERSON>. He appointed both colleagues to his new Cabinet.

Once installed in the post of Prime Minister,
  <PERSON> Major</PERSON> had immediately to deal with an international crisis when
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Kuwait</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was invaded by
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. He led
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> successfully in the short war waged by the Allies against
  <PERSON> Saddam Hussein</PERSON>.

Early into his term, he announced the abolition of the poll tax which had caused so much controversy during
  <PERSON> Thatcher</PERSON>'s final years in office. He also negotiated the Treaty on
  <ORGANISATION> European Union</ORGANISATION> at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Maastricht</LOCORG_CITY>, successfully winning a compromise that was acceptable, for a time, to the opposing wings of his party. Another personal initiative was the Citizens Charter, a code designed to introduce greater accountability to public services and to drive up standards of service.

  <PERSON>Major</PERSON>'s style was radically different from his predecessor. His unassuming and down-to-earth manner was initially considered a breath of fresh air, and a contrast to
  <PERSON> Margaret Thatcher</PERSON>'s forcefulness.

Under
  <PERSON> Major</PERSON> the Conservatives went on to win the
  <DATE> 1992</DATE> election with a workable majority, despite opinion polls which had predicted a hung parliament. However, over the next five years by-election losses and defections would whittle the governments majority down to single figures.

Perhaps the lowest point of
  <PERSON> John Major</PERSON>'s premiership came soon after the election: the sterling crisis of
  <DATE> September 1992</DATE> forced the pound to leave the ERM.

In
  <DATE> 1995</DATE>
  <PERSON> Major </PERSON>made a bold move to reassert his authority within the
  <ORGANISATION> Conservative Party</ORGANISATION> when he resigned as leader (but not as Prime Minister) and submitted himself for re-election. In the subsequent contest he was challenged by the Welsh Secretary,
  <PERSON> John Redwood</PERSON>, whom he defeated.

Towards the end of his term, the economy was steadily emerging from recession. However, the Conservatives were defeated by Labour in the
  <DATE> 1997</DATE> General Election, and
  <PERSON> John Major</PERSON> resigned as leader, having been Prime Minister for seven of the Conservatives eighteen consecutive years in power.

  <PERSON>John Major</PERSON> has now retired from the
  <LOCORG> House of Commons</LOCORG> and in
  <DATE> 1999</DATE> published his political memoirs.

  <PERSON>WINSTON CHURCHILL</PERSON>
  <PERSON>Winston Churchill</PERSON> was a politician, a soldier, an artist, and the <DATE>20th century</DATE>'s most famous and celebrated Prime Minister. His father was
  <PERSON> Lord Randolph Churchill</PERSON>, a Nineteenth Century Tory politician. He was educated at
  <LOCORG> Harrow</LOCORG> and at
  <LOCORG> Sandhurst Royal Military College</LOCORG>, after which he saw service in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Sudan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, and acted off-duty as a war correspondent.

  <PERSON>Churchill</PERSON> left the army in
  <DATE> 1899</DATE> to take up politics, but first travelled to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> South Africa</LOCORG_COUNTRY> as a journalist. Although taken prisoner by the Boers, he made a daring escape and returned to safety despite the price on his head. His consequent fame no doubt aided his success as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for
  <LOCORG> Oldham</LOCORG> in
  <DATE> 1900</DATE>.

  <PERSON>Churchill</PERSON> was instinctively independent, willing to work with any side agreeing with his goals. Thus his stand against protectionism led him to join the Liberals in
  <DATE> 1904</DATE>. As President of the Board of Trade in
  <ORGANISATION> Asquith's Liberal government</ORGANISATION> he set up labour exchanges and unemployment insurance. As Home Secretary in
  <DATE> 1910</DATE> he improved safety in the mines and prevented the employment of child miners, though disappointed radicals by deploying troops in
  <LOCORG> Wales</LOCORG> during a miners strike.

In
  <DATE> 1911</DATE> he was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, and ensured the Navy was ready for the outbreak of war in
  <DATE> 1914</DATE>. However, he was blamed for failed
  <LOCATION>  Dardanelles</LOCATION> Campaign in
  <DATE> 1915</DATE>, and was demoted in the coalition government. He resigned his post and went to the Front.

In
  <DATE> 1916</DATE>
  <PERSON> Lloyd George</PERSON> appointed him Minister for Munitions, in which post he developed the use of the tank in warfare. In
  <DATE> 1918</DATE> he took responsibility for demobilisation.

He returned to the
  <ORGANISATION> Conservative Party</ORGANISATION> in the
  <DATE> 1920s</DATE> and spent 5 years as
  <PERSON> Stanley Baldwin</PERSON>'s Chancellor, but again fell out with his party. Unpopular and ostracised for a decade, his warnings from the backbenches of Fascist imperialism went unheeded. His influence, it was said, had fallen to zero. However,
  <PERSON> Chamberlain</PERSON>'s policy of appeasement failed, leading to his resignation and to the vindication of
  <PERSON> Churchill</PERSON>'s position.
  <PERSON> George VI</PERSON> then asked
  <PERSON> Churchill</PERSON> to form a government in
  <DATE> 1940</DATE> at the age of 65.

Asking the
  <LOCORG> House of Commons</LOCORG> for its confidence in his small War Cabinet, he said "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat." His evocative and stirring rhetoric, employed in many famed speeches, is seen as representing the spirit of wartime
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, and was essential to raising national morale. He was renowned as a great character and a great leader but was a paradoxical man. Possessed of astonishing vision, he also made disastrous mistakes. Nevertheless, he brought
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to victory against
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> on the
  <DATE> 8th of May, 1945</DATE>.

Following the Labour landslide in the post-war
  <DATE> 1945</DATE> election, a surprised
  <PERSON> Churchill</PERSON> found himself leading the Conservative Opposition. He then served four years as a peacetime Prime Minister. The second
 <ORGANISATION> Churchill administration</ORGANISATION> did not realise his hopes of ending the Cold War. In contrast to the stark choices of the second world war, he found the problems facing post-war
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> elusive and intangible.

Frustrated and in poor health, he resigned in
  <DATE> 1955</DATE>, aged 81. Following his death in
  <DATE> 1965</DATE>,
  <PERSON> Churchill</PERSON>'s body lay in state for 3 days at
  <LOCATION> Westminster Hall</LOCATION> before his state funeral. 



  <LOCORG_CITY>CANNES</LOCORG_CITY>

	 	 
  <LOCORG_CITY>Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> is first and foremost discovering the selection of films and then the wait for the awards to be attributed.
But it is also a place where the future of cinema is prepared, where politics and artists, North and South, Art and Industry cross paths, brush against each other or meet.
It is our job to channel, organise these meetings so as to make them fruitful. This year, the priority is for
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> and, on an international level, the fight against piracy.
During the Day for
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>, on
  <DATE> May 18th</DATE>, 25 Ministers of Culture will discuss with
  <PERSON> Milos Forman</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Stephen Frears</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Jean-Claude Carrière</PERSON> and young artists "becoming a filmmaker".
And
  <DATE> May 16th</DATE>, the heads of major international studios meet to try to find an appropriate answer to the issue of piracy.

For the Festival must also be a special place for tailor-made meetings. The <LOCATION>Film Village</LOCATION> has become a large town in which you can wander until you have lost the idea of what you were looking for: we accredit 30,000 professionals 1,000 of whom are authors/directors, 4,000 distributors, 5,000 producers and 4,000 journalists.

In this capital of cinema, we have to build bridges between these different professions, continents and film generations.
This year, some 40 young filmmakers from all over the world are coming to the Festival to feast on film: in the Short Film Corner, they will be able to see their works and, thanks to the new network of producers (400 members), maybe find the partner they are looking for. The <LOCATION>International Village</LOCATION> will enable each of them to find their feet and cultural roots in their national pavilion, before blending once more into the common melting pot of the world of film.

These new initiatives come to strengthen the experiences of the Cinéfondation, the Résidence du Festival or the Caméra d'Or, by providing fertile soil which, although it is not enough to create a work, does go some way to encouraging its growth and discovery.
By provoking encounters, confronting differences and emphasising concert, the Festival fertilises the film industry so that all those who wish it may continue to make not only films, but construct an oeuvre.

Once the future has been glimpsed, one can return to the present in which we must, as ever, create the best possible conditions to host and celebrate such films.
The celebration of cinema is, above all, about shared pleasure: the pleasure shared in discovering a film in the presence of the cast and crew, which is of course a priceless and often overwhelming experience. But shared pleasure is also listening to the great masters when they accept to pass on their knowledge: the Film Lesson with
  <PERSON> Stephen Frears</PERSON>, the Music Lesson with
  <PERSON> Lalo Schifrin</PERSON> and, for the first time this year, an Acting Lesson. It is also the tributes paid by the Festival, each one tailor-made to fit the person it wishes to honour:
  <PERSON> Jean Luc Godard</PERSON> is to receive a surprise this year that you will discover once arrived.

Lastly, the celebration of film also means festive moments in which the barriers that enclose us in our professions and countries rise to make possible the most improbable and joyous meetings. Una gran fiesta to open the Festival, as only
  <PERSON> Almodovar</PERSON> knows how, and a beautiful party to celebrate the Award Ceremony in music on
  <DATE> Saturday 22nd</DATE>., over the whole
  <LOCATION> Bay of Cannes</LOCATION>. This year, the festive spirit should reach the same heights as the pleasure received from the films.

And now, since I've arrived at the closing ceremony, a few words about the near future. I'd just like to mention that for the 60th anniversary of the Festival in
  <DATE> 2007</DATE>, we are discussing celebrating the occasion with the
  <LOCORG> Centre Pompidou</LOCORG>, as it is their 30th birthday the same year.

And we are working with
  <PERSON> Bernard Brochand</PERSON>, the Mayor of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY>, on a Festival Museum project, the first stone of which should also be laid in
  <DATE> 2007</DATE>. 

  <ORGANISATION>THE OBSERVER</ORGANISATION>
  <PERSON>Michael Moore</PERSON>'s controversial polemic Farenheit 9/11 became the first documentary for nearly 50 years to win the Palme d'Or at the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> film festival last night.

The film, which contains scathing attacks on the business dealings of
  <PERSON> President George Bush</PERSON> as well as the first footage of American soldiers torturing prisoners in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, beat off competition from more famous directors, including
  <PERSON> Wong Kar-Wai</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Emir Kusturica</PERSON> and the
  <PERSON> Coen</PERSON> brothers to scoop top prize.

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, who was given a standing ovation by the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> crowd, told them: 'I'm completely overwhelmed by this. Merci.'

He added: 'The last time I was on an award stage in
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG>, all hell broke loose.'
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> had been heckled when he spoke out against
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> in his acceptance speech after winning an Oscar for his previous documentary, Bowling for Columbine.

He dedicated his victory to his daughter and to 'all the children in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and around the world who have suffered as a result of our actions.'

The film has been the subject of controversy following a decision by
  <ORGANISATION> Disney</ORGANISATION> not to distribute it during an election year.

The prizes were decided by a jury led by
  <PERSON> Quentin Tarantino</PERSON> and including actresses
  <PERSON> Tilda Swinton</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Kathleen Turner</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Emmanuelle Beart</PERSON>.


  <ORGANISATION>THE GUARDIAN</ORGANISATION>
The French appeared to have delivered another blow to
  <PERSON> George Bush</PERSON>'s war on terror by awarding the Palme d'Or to Fahrenheit 9/11,
  <PERSON> Michael Moore</PERSON>'s documentary about the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US </LOCORG_COUNTRY>president's foreign policy and war in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

But it was a jury with just one French member and four Americans which gave the top prize at the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> film festival to a documentary for the first time since
  <DATE> 1956</DATE>.

Last year the Palme d'Or went to Elephant, an American film dismissed as irresponsible by critics in the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> for its portrayal of the Columbine high school massacre: a topic also covered by
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> in the past. This year, it was won by a film which
  <ORGANISATION> Disney</ORGANISATION> refused to distribute in the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

Accepting the award after a standing ovation,
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> said he hoped Fahrenheit 9/11 would now be shown across the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> US</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.
  <ORGANISATION> Disney</ORGANISATION> blocked the distribution of the film, made by its subsidiary
  <ORGANISATION> Miramax</ORGANISATION>, and
  <ORGANISATION> Miramax</ORGANISATION> is now trying to find someone alse to put the film out before the presidential election in November. "Perhaps this film will have a tremendous impact. I hope it will,"
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> said, adding that he hoped
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON> would not choke on a pretzel when he heard the news.

"He has the funniest lines in the film. I am eternally grateful to him," he said of the American president.

"I want to thank
  <PERSON> Mr Bush</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Mr Cheney</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Paul Wolfowitz</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Donald Rumsfeld</PERSON>. I thought the love scene between
  <PERSON> Cheney</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Rumsfeld</PERSON> brought a tear to my eye."

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> denied he set out to make a political film and said
  <PERSON> Quentin Tarantino</PERSON>, the jury's president, told him the political message of Fahrenheit 9/11 did not influence its decision.

The three French films in the competition all won awards while 14-year-old
  <PERSON> Yagira Yuuya</PERSON> was named best actor for playing the eldest of four siblings growing up without their mother in the Japanese film Nobody Knows.

  <PERSON>Maggie Cheung</PERSON>'s portrayal of a drug addict trying to rebuild her life in Clean won her the best actress award.

The grand prize, the second place award, went to
  <PERSON> the South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook</PERSON> for his thriller, Old Boy.

French films won the directing and screenwriting prizes:
  <PERSON> Tony Gatlif</PERSON> won the director's prize for Exiles, while
  <PERSON> Agnes Jaoui</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Jean-Pierre Bacri</PERSON> won the screenplay award for Look at Me, a study of an overweight woman's self-image.

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> won an Oscar two years ago for Bowling for Columbine, his documentary attacking gun use in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>.

  <LOCORG>CANNES, France</LOCORG> 
(
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - Critics gave a rapturous reception to "Shrek 2" at the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> film festival Saturday, guffawing over the tale of a green ogre who finds true love.

"Thank you for that,"
  <PERSON> DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg </PERSON>said after the critics, often notoriously hard to please at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY>, welcomed the follow-up to the worldwide hit for voiceover stars
  <PERSON> Eddie Murphy</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Cameron Diaz</PERSON>.

With global appetite raging for animation movies,
  <PERSON> Katzenberg</PERSON> said work had already begun on Shrek 3 and Shrek 4.

And he was quick to boast that this was the first time in the 57-year history of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> that a movie and its sequel had both been in competition for the coveted Palme d'Or.

  <ORGANISATION>DreamWorks</ORGANISATION> flew in the voiceover cast for the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> screening, where many of the biggest laughs and the most applause went to
  <PERSON> Spanish heart-throb Antonio Banderas</PERSON> for his riotous portrayal of Puss-in-Boots.

He was quite happy to take a dig at himself on screen for the sake of laughs coming thick and fast.

"We are practically spoofing everything. I am spoofing myself doing
  <question> Zorro</question>. But it's not cheap parody. It is very well done," he told reporters.

  <PERSON>Eddie Murphy</PERSON>, who returns as the fast-talking donkey, admitted it was unnerving to make an ass of himself on screen -- especially as he could recognize his own gestures.

"When you are doing the voiceover sessions, they have a video camera recording what you are doing and the animators will take a gesture or a facial expression," he said.

"Every so often that donkey makes a face like I do. It is scary," he told reporters.

  <PERSON>Mike Myers</PERSON>, who returns as the ogre with a heart, was asked why so many Canadians went to
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG>.

 "We export three things -- comedians, hockey players and various strains of wheat," he said.

"We are on the borders looking in and making comments. We look a lot like them but we are the enemy within -- the body snatchers," he said with a big grin.

  <PERSON>British star Rupert Everett</PERSON>, who plays a riotously over-the-top Prince Charming in Shrek 2, was charm itself, answering his questions in French to the delight of local reporters.

The film is packed with jokey pop and
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> references. One of the biggest cheers came when the camera panned up from a bed shared by Shrek and his princess, played by
  <PERSON> Cameron Diaz</PERSON>.

On the wall was a poster of "
  <PERSON>Sir Justin</PERSON>."

But
  <PERSON> Diaz</PERSON> quickly knocked down with a curt answer a reporter who asked if her boyfriend,
  <PERSON> pop star Justin Timberlake</PERSON>, had liked the film.

"That is a question for him and he is not here and I can't really answer that for him," she said, a fixed grin firmly across her face.

  <LOCORG>CANNES, France</LOCORG>,
   (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - Critics rank
  <PERSON> Michael Moore</PERSON> as one of the favourites to land the top prize at the <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> film Festival after his blistering anti-
  <PERSON>Bush</PERSON> documentary won a standing ovation.

"Fahrenheit 911" is now firmly in line to be the first documentary to land the Palme d'Or since
  <PERSON> Jacques Cousteau</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Louis Malle</PERSON>'s marine epic "The World of Silence" in
  <DATE> 1956</DATE>.

The documentary, launched in a storm of publicity after a row over its distribution in a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> election year, is a relentless tirade against
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>'s handling of the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> conflict and the "war on terror."

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> would dearly love to see
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> defeated in November's election and critics saw the emotive documentary as an effective rallying cry for his opponents.

  <ORGANISATION>Screen International</ORGANISATION>, which takes the festival temperature every day, put
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> up with
  <PERSON> French director Agnes Jaoui</PERSON>'s "Look at me" on Tuesday as one of the leading contenders.

The magazine asks critics from as far apart as
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Estonia</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Canada</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to pick their favourites so far at the festival.

The influential Variety trade magazine called the film "a blatant cinematic
  <DATE> 2004</DATE> campaign pamphlet" and said
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> could convince disillusioned and disenfranchised Americans to vote.

"He might prove somewhat successful due to the emotionalism of his pitch," it said.

The
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> Reporter said: "What
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> seems to be pioneering here is a reality film as an election year device."

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, a masterful self-publicist in stirring up controversy over his documentaries, was welcomed by fans like a rock star when he took to the red carpet at the <LOCATION> Palais des Festivals</LOCATION> on Monday night.

  <PERSON>Cult film American film director Quentin Tarantino</PERSON> is heading the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> judges who pick the winner on Saturday of one of the movie world's most treasured prizes after the
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> Oscars.

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>'s latest documentary first hit the headlines when the
  <ORGANISATION> Walt Disney Co</ORGANISATION> barred its
  <ORGANISATION> Miramax film unit</ORGANISATION> from releasing such a politically polarising work so close to an election.

But
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> confidently predicted to reporters "This film will be seen in the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> before the election -- have no fear of that."

Judging by the 20-minute standing ovation for the film at its world premiere on Monday,
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> could be onto another winner.

Two years ago, his anti-gun lobby documentary "Bowling for Columbine" was rapturously received by the critics, went on to gross $120 million (68 million pounds) and landed
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> an Oscar.

  <LOCORG_CITY>CANNES</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - The world's biggest cinema showcase is braced for an ambush by part-time French actors and stagehands threatening to spoil
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY>'s annual cocktail of sun, celebrity and celluloid.

Fearing protests by entertainment workers demanding state unemployment handouts,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> laid on 1,000 police to protect the film festival which was due to open on Wednesday night with customary red-carpet razzmatazz.

"The
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> festival is a jewel of French culture which must be protected and it cannot be hampered or destroyed by protests of any kind," said
  <PERSON> Cannes Mayor Bernard Brochant</PERSON>.

Always mired in controversy, this year's
  <EVENT> Cannes Film Festival</EVENT> is no exception with the premiere of
  <PERSON> American filmmaker Michael Moore</PERSON>'s movie "Fahrenheit 9/11," a tirade against
  <PERSON> U.S. President George W. Bush</PERSON>.

Since the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Madrid</LOCORG_CITY> train bombings two months ago, security concerns have risen sharply across
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>. But for
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> organisers, the biggest headache could be their own industry.

Part-time actors and technicians -- who stopped several French festivals last year in a row over their benefits when out of work -- blocked for several hours the trucks carrying the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> movies from
  <LOCORG_CITY> Paris</LOCORG_CITY> to the <LOCATION>Riviera</LOCATION>.

Organisers of the festival, halted in
  <DATE> May 1968</DATE> at the height of student-worker protests, were trying to work with trade unions by offering them a platform to air their views.

MORE
  <PERSON> MOORE</PERSON>

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON>, lauded two years ago for his anti-gun lobby documentary "Bowling for Columbine," will compete with makers of 17 other films from around the globe for the coveted Palme d'Or award.

The
  <ORGANISATION> Walt Disney Co</ORGANISATION> has barred its
  <ORGANISATION> Miramax film unit</ORGANISATION> from releasing
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>'s anti-Bush movie, saying it did not want to put out a politically polarising film in a
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> election year.

"The Life and Death of
  <PERSON> Peter Sellers</PERSON>," a biography of the
  <PERSON> British comedian starring Geoffrey Rush</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Charlize Theron</PERSON>, has angered his family.

  <PERSON>Sellers</PERSON>'s third wife,
  <PERSON> Britt Ekland</PERSON>, called the casting of
  <PERSON> Theron</PERSON> "nonsense" and
  <PERSON> Sellers</PERSON>'s son has objected also.

  <PERSON>Cult film director Quentin Tarantino</PERSON> heads the judges for this year's festival where a third of the films come from
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Asia</LOCORG_CONTIN>.

It also offers a hefty dose of
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> mainstream with films like the animation hit follow-up "Shrek 2."

  <LOCORG_CITY>Berlin</LOCORG_CITY>,
  <LOCORG_CITY> Venice</LOCORG_CITY> and  <LOCORG_CITY>Sundance</LOCORG_CITY> are small but perfectly formed festivals where art is everything --
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY>, by contrast, is brash and glitzy. Movie moguls do mega deals and
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> sends in its big guns.

For
  <PERSON> actor Brad Pitt</PERSON>,
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY>
  <DATE> 2004</DATE> offers the chance to promote the $200 million sword-and-sandals epic "Troy".

For
  <PERSON> Tom Hanks</PERSON>, it's his maiden voyage to
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> where he will be publicising the
  <PERSON> Coen</PERSON> brothers' remake of the classic British comedy "The Ladykillers".

"There's not a lot of firsts you can have if you've been in the business as long as I have but I'm sure the first time at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> will be an extraordinary thing," he said.

  <LOCORG>Cannes</LOCORG> pits intellectual cinema critics against showbusiness writers who mock each other.

But, as
  <ORGANISATION> London's Times</ORGANISATION> wrote: "
  <LOCORG_CITY>Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> remains just what history has made it: a silly, splendid, valuable microcosm of the entire film industry."

  <ORGANISATION>WASHINGTON POST</ORGANISATION>
  By
  <PERSON> Joelle Diderich</PERSON>

  <LOCORG_CITY>PARIS</LOCORG_CITY> (
  <ORGANISATION>Reuters</ORGANISATION>) - The world's most glamorous film showcase is bracing for possible disruptions by out-of-work French actors and stagehands protesting a change to their unemployment benefits.
	

  <PERSON>Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres</PERSON> Wednesday announced the creation of a temporary fund to help part-time entertainment industry workers in a bid to quell their anger ahead of the
  <LOCORG_CITY>> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> festival, which runs from <DATE>May 12</DATE> to 23.

However the Communist-led
  <ORGANISATION> CGT union</ORGANISATION>, which represents the majority of workers in the sector, rejected the 20-million-euro ($24.3 million) fund as inadequate and pledged to step up its year-long protests.

"We can already say at this stage that the
  <DATE> 2004</DATE>
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> festival will be memorable," it said in a statement.

The <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> resort, a magnet for
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> movers and shakers, is scheduled to play host this year to stars including
  <PERSON> Brad Pitt</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Charlize Theron</PERSON>.
  <PERSON> Veronique Cayla</PERSON>, general director of the festival, said organizers were working with unions to prevent any recurrence of the type of protests which forced the cancellation of a spate of French music and theater festivals last summer.

"We are working on ways of giving them a platform," she told the daily
  <ORGANISATION> Liberation</ORGANISATION>. Security at the
  <LOCATION> Palais des Festivals</LOCATION>, the main venue for film screenings, will be particularly tight in the wake of the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Madrid</LOCORG_CITY> train bombings in March.

"We do not expect the
  <LOCATION> Palais des Festivals</LOCATION> to be taken by storm. But we can't control everything. Provocateurs and hard-liners can join this just cause and spoil the party which the festival should rightly be,"
  <PERSON> Cayla</PERSON> said.

In a bid to defuse tension,
  <PERSON> Donnedieu de Vabres</PERSON> will travel to
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> to keep up talks with union officials on the sidelines of official events.

"I am calling for everybody to show respect for the artists, for their output, for the public and simply for the pride and international reputation of our country," the minister told parliament during question time.

The
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> film festival has weathered its share of skirmishes in recent years.

In
  <DATE> 2002</DATE>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> delegates threatened to boycott the festival on charges that
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was anti-Semitic and last year, relations with the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> were at a low ebb over
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s opposition to the war in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. The show went on regardless.

  <ORGANISATION>CBS News</ORGANISATION>

(<ORGANISATION>REUTERS</ORGANISATION>) The French <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> resort of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> rumbled into gear Monday for its world-famous annual film festival, where a cast of thousands will gather over the next two weeks to celebrate the magic of the silver screen.

Actors, directors, distributors, journalists and assorted hangers-on began to flood into the Mediterranean city for a seemingly endless cycle of screenings, news conferences and parties that has made this the high point of the movie calendar.

"You can't miss the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> festival. All the players on the planet meet there, hook up, make film projects," festival chief
  <PERSON> Gilles Jacob</PERSON> said in a recent magazine interview.

The festival, which runs from <DATE>May 15</DATE> to 26, is primarily a showcase for the kind of art films that otherwise risk being ignored at the box office. But the intellectual fare is tempered with old-fashioned
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> glamour.

Cannes veterans like
  <PERSON> British directors Mike Leigh</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Ken Loach</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Portugal's Manoel de Oliveira</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Israel's Amos Gitai</PERSON> are among those bidding for the coveted Palme D'Or award.

Celebrities expected to walk up the red carpet include
  <PERSON> Leonardo DiCaprio</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Cameron Diaz</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Woody Allen</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Jack Nicholson</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Ralph Fiennes</PERSON>. They promise to restore the celebrity count after a threatened actors' strike kept many stars away last year.

For young filmmakers, the festival offers the chance to become an overnight star.

  <PERSON>Witness Bosnian director Danis Tanovic</PERSON>, a virtual unknown, who premiered his film "No Man's Land" in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes </LOCORG_CITY>last year and went on to win the Oscar for best foreign language movie.

"Since
  <DATE> May 12, 2001</DATE>, the date my film was shown at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY>, my life has changed,"
  <PERSON> Tanovic</PERSON> has said.

For others, the festival can prove a risky gamble. Earn bad reviews from the hundreds of film critics gathered here, and you can be virtually sure the film will flop at the box office.

  <PERSON>Tim Robbins</PERSON> said last year he never again wanted to present a movie he has directed at the hectic festival. "I don't get why you'd want to subject your baby to this place," the American actor-director told
  <ORGANISATION> Reuters</ORGANISATION>.

Many
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG> studios, wary of the festival's reputation for rewarding obscure foreign films, opt to screen their offerings out of the competition.

Among those hugging the sidelines this year are
  <PERSON> Barbet Schroeder</PERSON>'s "Murder by Numbers," starring
  <PERSON> Sandra Bullock</PERSON>, and the animated "Spirit" by
  <LOCORG> Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio</LOCORG>.

Special treats will include a 20-minute snippet from
  <PERSON> U.S. director Martin Scorsese</PERSON>'s eagerly-awaited "Gangs of
  <LOCORG_CITY> New York</LOCORG_CITY>," starring
  <PERSON> DiCaprio</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Diaz</PERSON>, scheduled for release in December.

  <PERSON>George Lucas</PERSON> will attend a screening of "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones" on
  <DATE> May 16</DATE>, the same day the blockbuster production hits
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> multiplexes.

If the jury is anything to go by, however, the big winner of the festival could be an altogether offbeat production.

Headed by director
  <PERSON> David Lynch</PERSON>, famous for his surreal and disturbing movies, the jury features five other directors in addition to actresses
  <PERSON> Sharon Stone</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Michelle Yeoh</PERSON>.

That should give a running start to competitors like
  <PERSON> David Cronenberg</PERSON>, whose "Spider" stars
  <PERSON> Fiennes</PERSON> as a schizophrenic, or the eccentric
  <PERSON> Aki Kaurismaki</PERSON>, offering a film about an amnesiac, aptly entitled "The Man Without a Past."

  <PERSON>American filmmaker Michael Moore</PERSON>'s "Fahrenheit 9/11" a scathing indictment of
  <LOCORG> White House</LOCORG> actions after the
  <DATE> Sept. 11 </DATE>attacks, won the top prize Saturday at the
  <question> Cannes</question> Film Festival.

"Fahrenheit 9/11" was the first documentary to win
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY>' prestigious Palme d'Or since
  <PERSON> Jacques Cousteau</PERSON>'s "The Silent World" in
  <DATE> 1956</DATE>.

"What have you done? I'm completely overwhelmed by this. Merci,"
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> said after getting a standing ovation from the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> crowd.

The grand prize, the festival's second-place honor, went to
  <PERSON> South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook</PERSON>'s "Old Boy," a blood-soaked thriller about a man out for revenge after years of inexplicable imprisonment.

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> was momentarily flabbergasted when he took the stage to accept the award, a big difference from his fiery speech against
  <PERSON> President Bush</PERSON> after winning the best-documentary Academy Award for
  <DATE> 2002</DATE>'s "Bowling for Columbine."

"You have to understand, the last time I was on an awards stage, in
  <LOCORG> Hollywood</LOCORG>, all hell broke loose,"
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> said.

The best-actress award went to
  <PERSON> Maggie Cheung</PERSON> for her role in "Clean" as a junkie trying to straighten out her life and regain custody of her young son after her rock-star boyfriend dies of a drug overdose.

  <PERSON>  Fourteen-year-old Yagira Yuuya</PERSON> was named best actor for the Japanese film "Nobody Knows," in which he plays the eldest of four sibling raised in isolation, who must take charge of the family when their mother leaves.

The directing and writing prizes went to French filmmakers.
  <PERSON> Tony Gatlif</PERSON> won the directing honor for "Exiles," his road-trip about a couple on a sensual journey from
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Algeria</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.

  <PERSON>Agnes Jaoui</PERSON> and her romantic partner,
  <PERSON> Jean-Pierre Bacri</PERSON>, won the screenplay award for "Look at Me," their study in self-image centering on an overweight young woman who feels neglected by loved ones.
  <PERSON> Jaoui</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Bacri</PERSON> also co-star.

"Fahrenheit 9/11" won the top award from sharply divided
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> moviegoers, who found a solid crop of good movies among the 19 entries in the festival's main competition but no great ones that rose to front-runner status.

While "Fahrenheit 9/11" was well-received by
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> audiences, many critics felt it was inferior to
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>'s Academy Award-winning documentary "Bowling for Columbine," which earned him a special prize at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> in
  <DATE> 2002</DATE>.

Some critics speculated that if "Fahrenheit 9/11" won the top prize, it would be more for the film's politics than its cinematic value.

With
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON>'s customary blend of humor and horror, "Fahrenheit 9/11" accuses the
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> camp of stealing the
  <DATE> 2000</DATE> election, overlooking terrorism warnings before
  <DATE> Sept. 11</DATE> and fanning fears of more attacks to secure Americans' support for the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> war.

  <PERSON>Moore</PERSON> appears on-screen far less in "Fahrenheit 9/11" than in "Bowling for Columbine" or his other documentaries. The film relies largely on interviews, footage of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY> soldiers and war victims in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, and archival footage of
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON>.

Just back in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> after his daughter's college graduation in the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <PERSON> Moore</PERSON> dedicated the award to "my daughter and to all the children in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and throughout the world who suffered through our actions."

"Fahrenheit 9/11" made waves in the weeks leading up to
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> after the
  <ORGANISATION> Walt Disney Co.</ORGANISATION> refused to let subsidiary
  <ORGANISATION> Miramax</ORGANISATION> release the film in the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> because of its political content.
  <PERSON> Miramax bosses Harvey</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Bob Weinstein</PERSON> are negotiating to buy back the film and find another distributor, with hopes of landing it in theaters by Fourth of July weekend.

  <PERSON>Quentin Tarantino</PERSON> headed the nine-member jury that handed out prizes in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY>' main competition. The other jurors included actresses
  <PERSON> Kathleen Turner</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Tilda Swinton</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Emmanuelle Beart</PERSON>.

  <PERSON>Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul</PERSON>'s "Tropical Malady" - widely regarded by
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> audiences as a snoozer for its elongated scenes of a man wandering a jungle alone, with no dialogue - won the festival's third-place jury prize.

Another jury prize went to
  <PERSON> Irma P. Hall</PERSON> for her role as an elderly Southern woman who foils a casino robbery in the
  <PERSON> Coen</PERSON> brothers' crime comedy "The Ladykillers," starring
  <PERSON> Tom Hanks</PERSON> as the heist's ringleader.

  <PERSON>Keren Yedaya</PERSON>'s "Or," about a
  <LOCORG_CITY> Tel Aviv</LOCORG_CITY> prostitute in failing health and her teenage daughter, won the Golden Camera award for best film by a first-time director. The
  <PERSON> U.S.-born Yedaya</PERSON>, who grew up in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, gives lectures about the problems of prostitution for government officials and mental-health professionals.

Earlier Saturday,
  <PERSON> Senegalese filmmaker Ousmane Sembene</PERSON>'s "Moolaade," an examination of the ritual of female circumcision that earned rave reviews, won the top prize in a secondary
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cannes</LOCORG_CITY> competition called "Un Certain Regard."

The 12-day festival's closing film - "De-Lovely,"
  <PERSON> Kevin Kline</PERSON>'s musical biography of
  <PERSON> Cole Porter</PERSON> - screened immediately after the awards.
  <PERSON> Kline</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> co-star Ashley Judd</PERSON> then hosted a beach concert featuring
  <PERSON> Sheryl Crow</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Alanis Morissette</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Natalie Cole</PERSON> and other singers from "De-Lovely" performing Porter tunes.

The festival was to wrap up Sunday with encore screenings of award winners and other key movies that played the festival, including a combined, four-hour version of
  <PERSON> Tarantino</PERSON>'s two "Kill Bill" installments.

Papers on the 60th anniversary of D-day.



	 In
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON>'s attendance,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s rehabilitation
  	
  <PERSON>Katrin Bennhold</PERSON>,
  <ORGANISATION> International Herald Tribune</ORGANISATION>
	
  <DATE>June 07, 2004</DATE>
  <LOCORG>CAEN, France</LOCORG> It is perhaps the final act of rehabilitation. For the first time
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> joined the club of Allied nations to celebrate
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s liberation from the grip of fascism more than half a century ago.
.
The unprecedented attendance of
  <PERSON> Chancellor Gerhard Schröder</PERSON> at the 60th anniversary of D-Day on the beaches of
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG> on Sunday has drawn the most symbolic line yet between the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> that attacked its neighbors in World War II and today's
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, whose freedom and democracy were also born on
  <DATE> June 6, 1944</DATE>. "It's not the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> of those dark ages that I represent here today,"
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON> said at the Franco-German ceremony at the
  <LOCATION> Caen Peace Memorial</LOCATION> that brought the ceremonies on Sunday to a close. "My country has returned to the fold of civilized nations. It traveled a long road to become a successful and stable democracy." At the same time the chancellor struck a humble tone, stressing that rehabilitation must never mean forgetting. "We Germans know we unleashed this heinous war," the chancellor told veterans and other visitors at the
  <LOCATION> Caen Peace Memorial</LOCATION>. "We recognize the responsibility our history has laid upon us."
.
  <PERSON>President Jacques Chirac</PERSON> hailed the German presence as the healing of a wound and a celebration of European integration."The European idea, the projects that it incarnates, were actually born here, with the end of the Third Reich,"
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> said at the joint address with
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON>. "What we owe our dead is to give a sense to their sacrifice, to resolutely commit to the only path that will ensure peace in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>: that of reconciliation between our two countries."According to an
  <ORGANISATION> IFOP</ORGANISATION> opinion poll, 88 percent of French people say that it was a good to invite
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON>; 11 percent said they were unhappy with his presence. Reaction among veterans ranged from wholehearted acceptance to deep unease.
.
  <PERSON>Rémy Dreyfus</PERSON> was 25 years old when he landed as a parachutist behind German lines. Of Jewish origin, he fled occupied
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to train with
  <ORGANISATION> Britain's Special Air Service</ORGANISATION>.
  <PERSON> Dreyfus</PERSON> is a staunch European and believer in Franco-German reconciliation, but he says he will never be at ease with German veterans at the ceremonies. "I draw the line at 75," he said. "I have no problem with Germans below 75, but I can't deny that I look at those above the age of 75 in a different way."
.
  <PERSON>Schröder</PERSON>, who was born in
  <DATE> 1944</DATE> just weeks before the invasion, is the first chancellor not to remember the war. His predecessor,
  <PERSON> Helmut Kohl</PERSON>, a teenager during the last years of the war, was not invited to the 50th anniversary in
  <DATE> 1994</DATE>, disappointing many German veterans.
.
  <PERSON>Alexander Uhlig</PERSON>, the only survivor of a parachute battalion, regrets that the Germans weren't invited earlier. "I think it's good that the Germans are here this time," he said.
.
  <PERSON>Schröder</PERSON> tread carefully, choosing the British cemetery in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Ranville</LOCORG_CITY>, with some 332 German graves, rather than the large German cemetery of
  <LOCORG_CITY> La Cambe</LOCORG_CITY>, where 21,500 German soldiers are buried, including SS troops.
.
He laid a wreath on the grave of an unknown German soldier.

Politicus
 
  <LOCORG_CITY>PARIS</LOCORG_CITY> In joining with leaders of World War II's victorious Allies in their commemoration of D-Day,
  <PERSON> Chancellor Gerhard Schröder</PERSON> has referred to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s presence on the
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG> invasion beaches as marking "the final end" to the postwar period and the completion of "
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s long journey to the West."
.
Alongside the chancellor's argument that the Allies liberated the Germans from Nazi tyranny, what this comes down to is a kind of political assurance that
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has forever abandoned its contemptuous notion of a mercantile, soulless West and its equally contemptuous but territorially hungry view of the lands beyond its eastern borders.
.
Coming in the context of
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON>'s current drive to win
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> a seat on the
  <ORGANISATION> United Nations Security Council</ORGANISATION>, a statement sounding like a guarantee of its comfortable anchorage in the acquisitive, nonromantic world of capitalism finds few doubters.
.
But concerning
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Eastern Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>,
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON>'s willful reading of his invitation to the D-Day anniversary as "the final end" to the postwar period is a different matter. It does not correspond entirely to current events and, for the time being, may be a bit of an imposition on history.
.
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s relationship in
  <DATE> 2004</DATE> with the country's two major neighbors to the east - or, perhaps most precisely, that of a significant number of Germans - involves harsh, palpable difficulties.
.
With backing from mainstream conservative and Social Democrat personalities, politically powerful groups of expellees from former German territories in the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Czech Republic</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Poland </LOCORG_COUNTRY>are mounting newly aggressive campaigns to regain their old properties and memorialize themselves as World War II victims.
.
A week ago, the
  <ORGANISATION> Christian Democratic Union</ORGANISATION>'s candidate for chancellor in
  <DATE> 2002</DATE>,
  <PERSON> Edmund Stoiber</PERSON>, spoke out in support of Bavarian conservatives' refusal in the
  <ORGANISATION> European Parliament</ORGANISATION> to approve Czech membership in the
  <ORGANISATION> European Union</ORGANISATION>. The reason was because the
  <ORGANISATION> Prague government</ORGANISATION> has turned its back on reviewing decrees that allowed Czechs to take over properties seized from
  <LOCORG> Sudetenland</LOCORG> Germans in
  <DATE> 1945</DATE>.
.
At the same meeting,
  <PERSON> Peter Glotz</PERSON>, a former general secretary of the
  <ORGANISATION> Social Democratic Party</ORGANISATION>, said that German tact over the issue of wartime expulsions must mean that when Germans talk about "our wounds," it is without the constraints of "politically correct murmuring." This is the sense of a
  <LOCORG> Center Against Expulsion</LOCORG> that Germans from the former
  <LOCORG>  Sudetenland</LOCORG> and Prussian territories want built in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Berlin</LOCORG_CITY>.
.
In
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Poland</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, where 57 percent of the population views <LOCORG_COUNTRY>Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> negatively, the juxtaposition of the country's new presence in the
  <ORGANISATION> European Union</ORGANISATION> and
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON>'s now officialized German view of a World War II ending with the Germans' liberation rather than their defeat is more than just an awkward coincidence. For Czechs as well, this adjusted reading of history accompanies an attempt to revive the issue of ownership of seized property based on a new legal front that the expellees opened with the entry of the two former Nazi-occupied countries into the
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION> on
  <DATE> May 1</DATE>.
.
While
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON> was saying that D-Day signaled "the starting point for today's new
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>" and maintained that the
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION> was "the best guarantor of peace" in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>,
  <PERSON> Stoiber</PERSON> was arguing that this wider
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION>, now taking in the countries of the former Soviet orbit, must be on the side of the German claimants. "Will the
  <ORGANISATION> EU</ORGANISATION> remain silent over this?" he asked. "
  <LOCORG_CONTIN>Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> must ask itself such questions now - and we're going to ask them."
.
Assuming that it was not
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON>'s intent to reopen the war's resolved territorial issues, he nevertheless faced the issue of calming enraged Poles and Czechs, while appearing not to disavow millions of Germans defining themselves as victims. The chancellor, after all, has now asserted that Germans were being liberated in
  <DATE> 1944</DATE> and
  <DATE> 1945</DATE>, just when the expellees were leaving areas that have become parts of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Poland</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Czech Republic</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.
  <ORGANISATION> Die Zeit</ORGANISATION>, the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Hamburg</LOCORG_CITY>-based weekly that reported the poll results on Polish attitudes, published a long article recently saying that a group of expellees, like those who invited
  <PERSON> Stoiber</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Glotz</PERSON> to their convention in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Nuremburg</LOCORG_CITY>, were calling "the postwar order into question and awakening the Poles' old fears and resentments." German-Polish relations, the newspaper said, "are enormously damaged."
.
Unquestionably, through its recognition of the
  <LOCATION> Oder-Neisse line</LOCATION>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> has given up any claim on dealing with lost territory or its border with
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Poland</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. But
  <ORGANISATION> Die Zeit</ORGANISATION> reported that the <LOCORG>German Finance Ministry</LOCORG> recently wrote to a potential claimant that the Federal Republic "never renounced individual claims by Germans," and pointed him in the direction of the courts.
.
In response, a Polish commission has set $31.5 billion (reckoned as much too low by some Poles) as the amount
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Poland</LOCORG_COUNTRY> should seek from
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> for damage during World War II if new German claims go ahead.
.
Attempting to reassure the Poles, the <ORGANISATION> German government</ORGANISATION> has spoken of proposed legal action as private initiative having nothing to do with German policy. But German jurists are said to consider that since the Germans and Poles have never reached a specific arrangement on the properties, the claims are not without potential validity.
  <ORGANISATION> Die Zeit</ORGANISATION> talked to a Polish historian,
  <PERSON> Krysztof Ruchniewicz</PERSON>, about the wider meaning and context of the moves by the expellees, who he said were regarded by Poles not as victims of
  <PERSON> Hitler</PERSON> but as supporters of the Nazis from regions that backed
  <PERSON> Hitler</PERSON> from his earliest days.
.
  <PERSON>Ruchniewicz</PERSON> was not surprised by the developments, the article said. The climate for it was prepared during recent years in which the Germans looked at themselves increasingly as victims.
.
"This started,"
  <ORGANISATION> Die Zeit</ORGANISATION> wrote, "with
  <PERSON> Gunter Grass</PERSON>'s short novel 'Im Krebsgang' in
  <DATE> 2002</DATE>, which involved the deaths of thousands of Germans on board the torpedoed ship
  <PERSON> Wilhelm Gustloff</PERSON>, then went on to books and TV documentaries on the Allied bombing of German cities and then to the <ORGANISATION>Federation of Expellees</ORGANISATION>' call for the construction of a
  <LOCORG> Center Against Expulsion</LOCORG>. In
  <LOCORG_CITY> Warsaw</LOCORG_CITY>'s mind, this center was going to be visible from
  <LOCORG_CITY> Berlin</LOCORG_CITY>'s Holocaust Monument - for Poles, an intolerable relativization of German guilt."
.
Within the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Berlin</LOCORG_CITY> leadership,
  <PERSON> Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer</PERSON>, whose German family left
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Hungary</LOCORG_COUNTRY> with the collapse of the Nazi occupation there, has been the most vocal in acknowledging the ambiguities of the rise of an increasingly aggressive body of self-declared German victims of World War II.
.
Like most of the left,
  <PERSON> Fischer</PERSON> maintains that "the fall of Nazism was a liberation - for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany </LOCORG_COUNTRY>too, precisely." Yet when the issue of a
  <LOCORG> Center Against Expulsion</LOCORG> first came up two years ago,
  <PERSON> Fischer</PERSON> opposed its becoming a national project.
.
If it were built on German soil, he said then, "You've got the reasonable suspicion that a rewriting of history is resulting from it, with a victim-oppressor reversal in roles."
.
  <PERSON>Fischer</PERSON> linked the destruction of Jewish culture with what he called the self-destruction of German culture, old German cities and German minorities in World War II. Debate about expelled Germans "as victims" was totally lacking, he said, in the sense that in the public mind in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> it generally began only with the German retreat and the advance of the
  <ORGANISATION> Red Army</ORGANISATION>.
.
"If you talk about expulsions," he said, "you can't leave out what went before. Otherwise you get into a fully false debate that says 'the Germans were also victims.' That's relativizing historical guilt and it comes with a confrontational, distorted perception of history which reflects neither the truth nor our European interests. The real debate is, What did we do to ourselves?"
.
In the case of the
  <LOCORG> Center Against Expulsion</LOCORG>, a bit of the confrontational nature of the proposal has been deflected by suggestions that it could be internationally funded, located outside
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to calm the anger of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s neighbors and focused on the fate of displaced populations throughout the world.
.
But that has none of the heat and grip of scores of thousands of properties and potential German claims lying beyond the final lines drawn by a war that effectively settled the place of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> eastern Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> almost 60 years ago.
.
Now, with
  <PERSON> Schröder</PERSON> saying that D-Day began the process of firmly tying
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to the West and that his invitation to
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG> marked the end of the postwar period, the old issues of Polish and Czech anxieties about Germans' intentions are back in a new form.

War turned invasion's overall commander into a pacifist
  	
  <PERSON>John S.D. Eisenhower</PERSON>
  <ORGANISATION> IHT</ORGANISATION>
	
  <DATE>Sunday, June 6, 2004</DATE>
The 60th anniversary of the Allied landings in
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG>, on the day known in common parlance as D-Day, was once again an occasion to pause and contemplate its significance. Like all Americans, I am proud of the achievements of my fellow soldiers but aware of the ordeal they underwent. To this day, I view those men with respect bordering on awe.
.
To me, as the son of
  <PERSON> Dwight D. Eisenhower</PERSON>, the general who commanded that invasion, it carries an added dimension. I find it difficult to believe, even after all these years, that my own father was such a historic figure. Sixty years of repetitive observances of D-Day have not dimmed my wonder.
.
The observance takes on additional meanings this year. For one thing, it is the last decade in which most of us veterans of that war will still be around. In addition, however, the observances are taking place in times of extreme danger for our country. That circumstance invites many people to compare today's scene with that of 60 years ago. I am asked time and again, "What would your father think if he were alive today?"
.
At this point, I must emphasize that I cannot with any confidence give an opinion regarding what my father would make of today's scene. He was unpredictable when examining any new problem because he always viewed it in its entirety, totally free of thumb rules and largely independent of tradition. More obviously, the world has changed drastically during the 43 years since my father left the presidency in
  <DATE> 1961</DATE>.
.
When the British and American landing craft plowed through heavy seas to assault the beaches of
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG> that dreary June morning,
  <PERSON> General Eisenhower</PERSON> - I'll call him "
  <PERSON>Ike</PERSON>" for convenience - had no time or inclination to contemplate the social, political and economic consequences of the hoped-for military success in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>. His mind was full of other things: Were the landings successful? How far had the troops been able to push inland? How heavy were the losses? What is the condition of the artificial harbors and the beaches? It was an experience of the moment.
.
Yet those worries quickly passed. When I joined my father for a brief visit in
  <LOCORG_CITY> London</LOCORG_CITY> a week after D-Day, the experience of D-Day had virtually disappeared from his mind. The day's dramatic events, with their threat of disaster for the Allied cause but eventual triumph, were gone. D-Day was one event in a sequence of events that culminated in the destruction of the Nazi regime and the German war machine.
.
The experience of that 11-month campaign, plus
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s later service as the first military commander of
  <ORGANISATION> NATO</ORGANISATION> six years later, produced profound effects on him, changing some of his convictions and confirming others. I would like to list some of them, not in the abstract but by the evidence of his later actions.
.
The most fundamental conviction that the period of
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s command in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> and the
   Mediterranean imprinted on his mind was the cruelty, wastefulness and stupidity of war. He saw at firsthand how war destroyed cities, killed innocent people (in which I include most of the participating soldiers), wiped out national economies and tore up the structure of civilizations. Its wastefulness cut him to the bone, and its specter never left him. As a result, as president he kept the military budget as small as was consistent with the safety of the nation. He expressed his convictions eloquently in
  <DATE> April 1953</DATE>, about three months after his inauguration as the 34th president of the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY>:
.
"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
.
"The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.
.
"It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population.
.
"It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals\u2026.
.
"We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed 8,000 people."
.
Not surprisingly, the war that included D-Day had made a pacifist of the man who bore the responsibility, its supreme commander.
.
As I consider the effect that D-Day and the war in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> had on my father, I am struck by the degree to which it convinced him of the value of allies.
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>, in leading an army and air force of five million soldiers and airmen of all nationalities, realized full well that the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, while providing the bulk of the materiel and manpower, could never go it alone. Though
  <ORGANISATION> Hitler's Wehrmacht</ORGANISATION> was weakened after five years of war, the vaunted and professional
  <ORGANISATION> German Army</ORGANISATION> still had a lot of fight left in it when the Anglo-American armada crossed the
  <LOCATION> English Channel</LOCATION> in
  <DATE> 1944</DATE>. Later in the campaign, the hedgerows, dense forests and formidable rivers such as the
  <LOCATION> Roer</LOCATION> and the
  <LOCATION> Rhine</LOCATION>, worked all to
  <PERSON> Hitler</PERSON>'s advantage. The ability to switch German forces back and forth between the Russians in the east and the Western Allies in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Belgium</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Luxembourg</LOCORG_COUNTRY> gave
  <PERSON> Hitler</PERSON>'s generals great power. They were still a formidable force to defeat.
.
To
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>, therefore, his British (and later French) allies were no luxury; they were absolutely necessary. But they were no toadies. Dealing with the strong-minded leaders of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> -
  <PERSON> Winston Churchill</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Charles de Gaulle</PERSON> respectively - was difficult. At times it was frustrating. But always it was rewarding.
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON> viewed allies as invaluable assets, not only for their material contributions, but for their wisdom as well.
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON> did not consider that giving in to their demands when necessary was any sign of weakness on his own part. Doing so was simply part of a great cooperative effort.
.
With his detestation of war as a means of settling international disputes,
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON> applauded the formation of the
  <ORGANISATION> United Nations</ORGANISATION> in
  <DATE> 1945</DATE>, even though he had no hand in its formation. Leaving the army in
  <DATE> 1948</DATE> for private life, he was recalled to active duty in early
  <DATE> 1951</DATE> to organize the military forces of the
  <ORGANISATION> North Atlantic Treaty Organization</ORGANISATION> when the military threat from the east seemed to become imminent. In his stay in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Paris</LOCORG_CITY>,
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON> developed a strong belief in
  <ORGANISATION> NATO</ORGANISATION> that he never lost.
.
It so happens that I was witness to one example of
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s concern for the opinions and attitudes of his allies during his presidency. In
  <DATE> September 1959</DATE>,
  <PERSON> Premier Nikita Khrushchev </PERSON>of the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Soviet Union</LOCORG_COUNTRY> served up an ultimatum to the Western allies to get out of
  <LOCORG_CITY> West Berlin</LOCORG_CITY> or else.
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON> chose to negotiate while rejecting the ultimatum. In the course of the ensuing talks, a mix-up in signals in the <ORGANISATION>State Department</ORGANISATION> resulted in an unintended invitation for
  <PERSON> Khrushchev</PERSON> to visit the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> alone, not in the company of all the nations involved in the current crisis.
.
That unilateral invitation may or may not have turned out to be a good thing, but the incident illustrated
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s concern that his allies - now
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and the newly emerging
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> West Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY> - be assured that he had no intention of representing their interests in his forthcoming conferences with
  <PERSON> Khrushchev</PERSON>. So
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON> took some of his personal staff and boarded a new Boeing 707 on its maiden voyage as Air Force One to visit
  <PERSON> Konrad Adenauer</PERSON> in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Bonn</LOCORG_CITY>,
  <PERSON> Harold Macmillan</PERSON> in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <PERSON> de Gaulle</PERSON> in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Paris</LOCORG_CITY>. With all of them he conducted frank talks, and
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s allies were reassured. He would have it no other way.
.
  <PERSON>Ike</PERSON> totally disapproved of "preventive war," and that conviction was put to the test early in his presidency. Some time in the early
  <DATE> 1950s</DATE> the Soviet development of the hydrogen bomb and the means to deliver it caused many Americans, some of
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s advisers among them, to advocate launching a preemptive strike against the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Soviet Union</LOCORG_COUNTRY> while the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> still enjoyed a preponderance of atomic power and the means of delivering atomic weapons. It would be preferable, these people argued, to remove the Soviet weapons of mass destruction. No legal or moral justification was required. A few million Americans would be killed, of course, but a far fewer number than if we waited and allowed the "Evil Empire" (not
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s term) to strike first.
.
Ike would have none of it. Throughout his presidency he combined a policy of maintaining a military deterrent to war while at the same time extending the hand of friendship. The uneasy peace between the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Soviet Union</LOCORG_COUNTRY> - the cold war - continued for nearly 50 years. It was expensive and it was dangerous, but civilization survived.
.
A less apocalyptic event demonstrated to the world that
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s rejection of force as an instrument of national policy applied to everyone - to
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>, to
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s friends, as well as to
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s potential enemies. In the later months of
  <DATE> 1956</DATE>, in the midst of a presidential election,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Britain</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Israel</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, two of them
  <ORGANISATION> NATO</ORGANISATION> allies, launched an attack against
  <PERSON> Egypt's Gamal Abdul Nasser</PERSON> after his seizure of the
  <LOCATION> Suez Canal</LOCATION>. The Egyptian action, admittedly, had been an international headache, but
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON> refused to condone the use of force, even by his friends. He sponsored a vote of censure in the
  <ORGANISATION> United Nations</ORGANISATION>, and the governments of those three countries, under the pressure of world opinion, withdrew their forces.
.
This action on
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s part did not imply rancor against the offenders. It was simply an expression of principle. This he demonstrated in the immediate aftermath of the episode. In the course of the brief fighting,
  <PERSON> Nasser</PERSON> had sunk ships enough to close down the
  <LOCATION> Suez Canal</LOCATION>.
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON> and his experts immediately sat down to plan ways to ensure at least a minimum supply of heating oil to bring
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Western Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> through the winter of
  <DATE> 1956-57</DATE>.
.
While the recitation of these events seems remote from the D-Day we are commemorating, I offer them as offshoots of
  <PERSON> Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON>'s experiences in the campaigns of
  <DATE> 1944-45</DATE>. Many of
  <PERSON> Ike</PERSON>'s policies were different from those we see being followed today. But he was the first to admit that situations change, and the policies followed in one generation might be used as guides to future action but never rules. How he would view today's world scene, I repeat that I do not know.
.
But I wonder.

On cliff over
  <LOCATION> Omaha Beach</LOCATION>, a man who fought remembers
  	
  <PERSON>John Vinocur</PERSON>
  <ORGANISATION> NYT</ORGANISATION>
	
  <DATE>Friday, June 4, 2004</DATE>
  <LOCATION>Pointe du Hoc</LOCATION> is a knife, stood on its edge, pointed into the sea. It looks lethal, a palisade of boulder and mean rocks where
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG>'s green softness has reclaimed nothing. Battlefields: You could walk them from
  <LOCORG_CITY> Gettysburg</LOCORG_CITY> to
  <LOCORG_CITY> Waterloo</LOCORG_CITY> and go back to your car thinking of lunch. But not at
  <LOCATION> Pointe du Hoc</LOCATION>. The brightest morning roughens there, the wind working like a rasp, still scoring cruel edges on the sheer cliffs. On D-Day, the
  <ORGANISATION> U.S. Army</ORGANISATION>'s Second Ranger Battalion had to climb the knife's blade through bullets and shells. In
  <DATE> 1984</DATE>, looking down to the sea from the viewpoint of the German machine-gun emplacements, imagination becomes superfluous. The emotions are all immediate and distinct: My God, they made it to the top; this is still a cruel place; it holds the mark of a killing ground.
.
  <LOCATION>Pointe du Hoc</LOCATION> is special. For the most part, the pastoral blanket of
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG> covers over any sense of the fury, the dying and the scale involved in the thrust of 180,000 Allied troops into
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> on the
  <DATE> 6th of June, 1944</DATE>. The pastures are too lush, the land too rich with apple orchards and rose arbors. In
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG>, near the beaches, the war burned fast. There is no complaint, of course - the Allies rushed through the nearby countryside and were soon gone; 11 months after D-Day,
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Hitler's Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> fell. Occasionally, a speech (hundreds are scheduled this year) will resemble the regrown landscape and turn the invasion to whole glory, leaving the dead as a detail. Reality was something else. In the first 25 hours, the
  <ORGANISATION> U.S. 1st Army</ORGANISATION> had 6,603 casualties; two months later, the Americans had to use bulldozers to clear a passage through the 40,000 German corpses at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Chambois</LOCORG_CITY> to the south.
.
  <LOCORG>Normandy</LOCORG>, its landscape healed, soothes mostly, and holds tightly to its emotions. They are there, although not much at
  <LOCORG> Utah</LOCORG> or
  <LOCATION> Omaha Beaches</LOCATION>, or in the invasion museums, where models of the engineering feats have the look of Erector sets, and the old uniforms seem like rock band gear from costume shops. The sense of war, the extraordinary bravery of the Allied armies, the numbers, the losses, the real suffering that disappears in time and commemorative oratory, are not marked out in any red guidebook of the emotions, but they are present if you look.
.
I went to the D-Day beaches for the first time 15 years ago, in
  <DATE> May 1969</DATE>, expecting no feelings at all.
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> seemed so rich and self-content that it was hard to believe that the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> had to come to help. World War II, just 25 years earlier, felt terribly long ago then; in
  <DATE> 1969</DATE> there was too much war going between my own contemporaries, all of it bad, the just cause not having leaped the generational gap. I had just returned from
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Biafra</LOCORG_COUNTRY> reporting on a ghastly and lunatic war of starved children and big oil interests, and the news in the papers was of
  <LOCATION> Hamburger Hill</LOCATION>, the tag name for a place the
  <ORGANISATION> U.S. Army</ORGANISATION> was having trouble capturing in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Vietnam</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. The stories made clear that there were grunts who did not want to go into the fire, and the accounts, I thought, were written with the sympathy of the times, and probably often read that way too.
.
I got to
  <LOCATION> Pointe du Hoc</LOCATION> mostly by accident then because the road was not well marked and seemed to peter out in the fields. The wind jumps up from the sea as you get closer, and the fields begin to roll and dip, cratered by the Allied offshore bombardment. At the edge of the cliffs, the wind is a smack, and D-Day becomes wildly clear: climbing that cutting edge into the bullets. The first men came up on rope, and then ladders belonging to the
  <ORGANISATION> London Fire Department</ORGANISATION>. The Germans, firing down at them, even rolling boulders over the precipice, killed more Americans in the first wave than those who got to the top.
.
The day I was there, a man paced around
  <LOCATION> Pointe du Hoc</LOCATION> as if he were taking measurements for a linoleum company. His name was
  <PERSON> Robert Fruling</PERSON>, he worked in a spare parts department in
  <LOCORG_CITY> West Palm Beach, Florida</LOCORG_CITY>, and he was looking around because he had come up the cliffs as a Ranger. I heard how he got hell for losing the radio he was toting, and how a bullet went through his helmet, kindly following a path that avoided his head. He talked about the place with a kind of chirpy good humor for a while and then he stopped. About 75 men of the 235 he came ashore with survived. "We got it, and we got it," he said, and turned away. He bent over shaking with sobs.
.
There is as much death as glory now at
  <LOCATION> Pointe du Hoc</LOCATION>, and somehow, in a recriminating
  <DATE> 1984</DATE>
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>, a disenchanted one, the battlefield and D-Day seem more real than in
  <DATE> 1969</DATE>. Do we discuss going up the cliff? Not here.
  <LOCATION> Pointe du Hoc</LOCATION> offers its own conclusions, a battlefield never gone quite still.
.
The quiet lies elsewhere, its emotions strong. The American cemetery at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer</LOCORG_CITY> is a great lawn at the edge of the sea, white marble crosses and Stars of
  <PERSON> David</PERSON> against an open horizon. It is a graceful, light, uncomplicated place. I think of it as very American in the best sense: no phony piety, simple, easy. The graves are the message, and they are left alone: long rows, long rows, long rows. Unequivocal. The monument is inscribed with monument-inscription language, but minus the tremolo, it is right: "This embattled shore, portal of freedom, is forever hallowed by the ideas, valor and sacrifice of our fellow countrymen." At
  <LOCORG_CITY> Cambe</LOCORG_CITY>, near
  <LOCORG_CITY> Isigny</LOCORG_CITY>, away from the sea, and off a main road, there is a German cemetery. It is a very different place, a powerful one, not so simple, not so certain, one that is more of this than that other time. The headstones are low and dark, almost black, looking like Knight's Crosses. The grass is let to grow high, and it moves in the wind against the dark stones. The Germans executed scores of French hostages at
  <LOCORG_CITY> Caen</LOCORG_CITY>, nearby, the night of the invasion, but no one has ever touched, tried to vandalize, these graves. They have extraordinary dignity. As much as
  <LOCORG_CITY> Saint-Laurent</LOCORG_CITY> seems American in its emotions, as much as it seems to reflect the right war and its cost,
  <LOCORG_CITY> La Cambe</LOCORG_CITY> strikes me as German; it has real beauty, and a dark, melancholy strength.
.
How do you mark the graves of a defeated army, fighting for monstrous goals, on the land of a country it had conquered? "Here lie German soldiers," one inscription says. On a pedestal in the same dark stone, old parents huddle and grieve. And this, chiseled deep: "God has the last word."
.
This is the 40th anniversary of D-Day. The law of round numbers and memorial reflection probably mean that the next time people think about it much is in another 10 years. In spite of
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG>'s forgetting meadows, the cliffs and the graveyards will not lose their strength, their terror, their message.








  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>US</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>: We still need each other

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>U.S.</LOCORG_COUNTRY>-
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>
 
  <LOCORG_CITY>NEW YORK</LOCORG_CITY> On Sunday,
  <PERSON> President George W. Bush</PERSON> will stand at attention next to
  <PERSON> President Jacques Chirac of France</PERSON>
   at the American military cemetery near
  <LOCATION> Omaha Beach</LOCATION>. Thousands of Frenchmen and Americans will mingle on the site to remember, mourn and celebrate the young men who died in the
  <LOCORG> Normandy</LOCORG> landings 60 years ago.
.
While there are, today, some Americans who like to think that the French don't remember D-Day, that is far from the truth; they do remember, and they are grateful. I travel to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> regularly and it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world - one that is inhabited by some of the most intelligent and, yes, complicated people in the world. On one subject, the French are united: they are consumed with anxiety (and curiosity) about the decline of the French-American relationship. Despite the hostility generated by the war in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, they wish for the relationship to be better.
.
On the American side of the ocean, there is no such curiosity, much less anxiety. There is only a certain dismissiveness and this silent reproach: "They don't remember." That is both untrue and self-defeating. It is difficult to understate
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s importance to
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> - and to us.
.
To repair the relationship, though, we need to understand how it unraveled. While the mistakes made by both our governments in the run-up to the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> war did grave damage, they are only part of the story. The
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> have been moving apart in fundamental ways for a long time now.
.
As the world has changed - shaped by the end of the Soviet threat, the economics of globalization and the rise of terrorism -
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> and
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN> have inevitably changed, too.
.
The election of
  <PERSON> Bush</PERSON> and the events of
  <DATE> 9/11</DATE> intensified the pace of change in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>.
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s immediate focus became a global war on terrorism: absolute military domination was combined with the concept of pre-emptive war. Americans became more patriotic, and struggled with the reality that we were both invincible and vulnerable.
.
This was in stark opposition to what was going on in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>. Just as we were becoming more warlike and unilateral,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> were working toward European integration while trying to minimize conflict wherever possible.
.
Our economies were also diverging. While in the
  <DATE> 1960s</DATE> and
  <DATE> 1970s</DATE> we were on reasonably parallel paths, the American economy began to surge ahead of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s in the
  <DATE> 1980s</DATE>, the result of higher population growth, increased productivity and large investments in technology.
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s interests also turned increasingly toward countries like
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> China</LOCORG_COUNTRY>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> India</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Russia</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. The priorities of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, meanwhile, revolved more and more around European enlargement and its own role in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>.
.
I had the privilege of serving as ambassador at a time when the French-American relationship was quite positive, despite serious problems with respect to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and any number of other issues, from genetically modified foods to the death penalty. The military cooperation in the
  <LOCORG> Balkans</LOCORG> was excellent, the economic partnership was booming and the personal relationships between
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> President Bill Clinton</PERSON>,
  <PERSON> Secretary of State Madeleine Albright</PERSON> and
  <PERSON> Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine</PERSON> were solid.
.
Even then, though, one could sense that the relationship was evolving. When
  <PERSON> Vedrine</PERSON> referred to "American hegemony" and to the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> as a "hyperpower,"
  <PERSON> Albright</PERSON> took it as criticism. In fact, it was more a combination of admiration, envy and fear, expressed by a sophisticated Frenchman. And all those fears came true when we marched into
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, and brought war to the outer borders of
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>.
.
Today, there is no such thing as old and new
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN>; they are both the
  <ORGANISATION> European Union</ORGANISATION>, which has been evolving for 50 years. There is, however, a "new
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>," and it looks at
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> with a certain disdain because we believe that our main interests are elsewhere. To some extent, however, the same can be said for
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. Yet
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN> is beginning to realize that solitude, even for a global superpower, may not be the best policy. The
  <ORGANISATION> Bush administration</ORGANISATION>'s request for
  <ORGANISATION> UN </ORGANISATION>assistance in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq </LOCORG_COUNTRY>and the cooperation with
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Haiti</LOCORG_COUNTRY> may be belated recognition of the reality that
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN> needs the legitimacy conferred by the international community when it exercises its power.
.
I have seen
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> at its most tragic in
  <DATE> 1940</DATE>, and I have seen it at its best in later years. Although there will still be differences about
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and other issues, I know that
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN> need each other strategically, economically, culturally.
.
And beyond that, there is the history buried in the cemetery of
  <LOCATION> Omaha Beach</LOCATION>. We need a relationship built on mutual respect as well as mutual interest. Perhaps it will be rekindled on
  <LOCATION> Omaha Beach</LOCATION>.

   	 A German childhood healed by GIs
  	
  <PERSON>Karl Kaiser</PERSON>
  <ORGANISATION> IHT</ORGANISATION>
	
  <DATE>Friday, June 4, 2004</DATE>
  <LOCORG_CITY>CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts</LOCORG_CITY> In the last days of
  <DATE> April 1945</DATE>, the Allied front was approaching my home town in
  <LOCORG> southern Westphalia</LOCORG>. Around us were the signs of a collapsing country: smoking ruins, battered German troops moving through the town, old men - including my father, whose World War I wounds had until then protected him from front-line duty - being rushed to the
  <LOCORG> Ruhr</LOCORG> area for a last-ditch defense
.
My life as a 10-year-old was not much different from the lives of the adults: bombed repeatedly inside and outside shelters, learning to appreciate ditches when free-roaming fighter planes shot at everything that moved on the ground.
.
It must have been the spreading sense of doom and possibly the impact of the ongoing propaganda about "Anglo-American terror tactics" that led my mother to conclude that a battle in the city would be worse than anything we had experienced so far. So we fled to the countryside, with the help of a pound of coffee, in a truck propelled by those amazing wood-burning engines of the time, two people always scanning the skies for planes.
.
However, when we arrived at our destination, an isolated forester's house with a broad view on a valley, matters quickly worsened. The retreating German army established a headquarters there while we, along with a dozen other women and children, crouched in the cellar, listening with growing concern to the hectic activity upstairs and the approaching rumble of artillery and tanks.
.
Suddenly there was a lot of shouting and running above us, and the Germans left, followed first by silence, then the clank of what were obviously American tanks. They stopped outside the house. Over the idling engines we heard the door to the cellar being thrown open. Would they now toss a grenade down, as we assumed Americans always did? We heard a person cautiously coming down the steps and stopping in front of our door. We remained totally silent, expecting something terrible to happen. Suddenly the door was pushed open, and the barrel of a rifle appeared, followed very slowly by an American helmet. The soldier under itquietly surveyed us, then smiled and said, "Hi." The war was over. We were alive.
.
Only later did I realize how the humane treatment of civilians by the
  <ORGANISATION> U.S. Army</ORGANISATION>, indeed their friendly behavior (defying in many cases
  <PERSON> General Dwight D. Eisenhower</PERSON>'s orders against fraternization) not only undid the negative images of
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN> created by Nazi propaganda, but also helped a generation of young Germans to grow up with a positive image of American soldiers.
.
In that forester's house I listened to the Americans talking with the grownups, through a teacher of English in our group, about what had been wrong with the
  <PERSON> Hitler</PERSON> regime. The Americans shared C-rations with us kids and established order in our town when it was threatened by chaos. When looters attacked our house I ran to the nearby
  <ORGANISATION> U.S. Army</ORGANISATION> headquarters for help, and an American soldier jumped in a truck with me, rushed to our place and dispersed the bandits by shooting in the air. Countless young American officers helped to restart towns all over
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. That American troops remained throughout the cold war to protect us and to preserve a free
  <LOCORG_CITY> Berlin</LOCORG_CITY> solidified the positive image.
.
Strangely it was the images of Germans with tears in their eyes when American soldiers left
  <LOCORG_CITY> Berlin</LOCORG_CITY> in
  <DATE> 1994 </DATE>that flashed through my mind when I saw the horrible pictures of American soldiers mistreating and torturing prisoners in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY>. Although suspicions about
  <LOCORG> Guantánamo </LOCORG>had already begun undermining the image of American military forces, the shock effect of those revelations on
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s allies was and remains profound.
.
  <LOCORG_CONTIN>America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s friends in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Europe</LOCORG_CONTIN> and presumably all over the globe now invest their hope in the corrective power and strength of democracy in the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, which sacrificed so many thousands of its soldiers to uphold these very values on our side of the Atlantic 60 years ago.

The white star of freedom

  <DATE>Friday, June 4, 2004</DATE>
  <LOCORG_CITY>PARIS</LOCORG_CITY> In
  <LOCORG_CITY> Auschwitz</LOCORG_CITY>,
  <DATE> June 6, 1944</DATE>, was a day like any other.
  <PERSON> Hitler</PERSON>'s cattle trains were discharging their human cargo for mass destruction at the same hellish pace. The death toll in the gas chambers that day was higher even than the enormous losses suffered by the combined armies under
  <PERSON> General Dwight Eisenhower</PERSON>'s command.
.
We had every reason to believe that the war was irrevocably lost, that the
  <ORGANISATION> Red Army</ORGANISATION> had been smashed, that
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> England</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was fighting alone against the seemingly invincible forces of darkness. And
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>? It was so far away, so divided, so unprepared. How could it be expected to reverse the tide of doom?
.
It took weeks for news of the invasion, beamed by the
  <ORGANISATION> BBC</ORGANISATION>, to slip into the camp via the Polish resistance. There was also a rumor that the Russians had mounted an offensive on the eastern front. Oh, to hang on a little longer! I was 15 and I wanted to live.
.
We could tell from the growing nervousness of our guards that the weight of battle was shifting. They were herding us deeper into
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Germany</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. It was in a slave labor enclave of
  <LOCORG_CITY> Dachau</LOCORG_CITY> that I heard for the first time the silence of the night torn by distant explosions. Within hours we were evacuated again, ahead of the "enemy advance." These magic, intoxicating words were now openly murmured.
.
My final death march continued day and night, halting only for meager rations of bread and water. At dawn, on the third day, a squadron of Allied fighter planes, mistaking our column for Wehrmacht troops, swooped down to strafe us. As the SS-men hit the dirt, their machine guns blazing, their vicious dogs growling, a comrade near me shouted, "Run for it!" A group of us made a clumsy sprint for the trees. Only five reached the forest alive. We kept running, gasping for breath, until we collapsed. There was no sound of pursuit; just the thunder of our hearts and the long-forgotten music of chirping birds.
.
At night we began moving toward the western front. One bucolic afternoon, holed up in the hayloft of an abandoned Bavarian barn, I became aware of a hum, like a swarm of bees, only louder, metallic, unearthly. I peeped though a crack in the wooden slats. Across the field, a huge tank, leading a military convoy, lumbered my way. From somewhere to one side I could hear the firing of mortars. The tank's cannon turned and let loose a deafening blast. The firing stopped. The tank resumed its cautious advance.
.
I looked for the hated swastika. Instead I saw an unfamiliar emblem - a five-pointed white star. In an instant the unimaginable flooded my soul. After so many tortures and humiliations in the pit of the abyss, I was beholding the glorious insignia of the
  <ORGANISATION> U.S. Army</ORGANISATION>.
.
With a wild roar, I ran toward the wondrous vision, waving my arms. Suddenly, the hatch of an armored vehicle opened, and a face shielded by helmet and goggles emerged, swearing at me unintelligibly. At that instant I felt immortal, though to the startled GI my situation must have seemed desperate indeed. Pistol in hand, he jumped to the ground to examine me more closely, as if to make sure that the kid was not booby-trapped.
.
To signal that I was a friend, and in need of help, I fell to my knees, threw my arms around his legs, summoned the few English words my mother used to sigh while dreaming of our deliverance, and yelled: "God Bless
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>!" With an unmistakable gesture the tall American motioned me to get up, and lifted me through the hatch - into the womb of freedom.
.
Today, when a wave of anti-Americanism is sweeping the world, when GIs are accused of being amoral and sadistic, the survivor in me exclaims, "Never forget the courageous soldier and the compassionate army that once brought you life and liberty." But the jurist in me cautions, "Those responsible for the scandalous mistreatment of prisoners of war must be brought to justice."
.
I have learned from bitter experience that war is ugly and chaotic. In
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, its management has been undermined by serious errors of strategy and outrageous lapses of discipline. Small wonder that
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> America</LOCORG_CONTIN>'s vigorous democracy is in the throes of a soul-searching debate on its thankless mission as liberator of the oppressed.
.
Yet, in the explosive
  <LOCORG> Middle East</LOCORG>, where the stakes are colossal for all concerned, its responsibilities are as vital as they are difficult. Were the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> United States</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to succumb to isolationist ghosts, it would disastrously weaken those striving for security, tolerance and progress in a terrorist-ridden world, when
  <ORGANISATION> Al Qaeda</ORGANISATION> is threatening to sow havoc on all continents.
.
At this critical juncture, when sovereignty is being transferred to Iraqis, responsible leaders on all continents, even those who opposed the war, must reach out for an international consensus and a common strategy to stabilize
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> and combat global terrorism, in the same spirit of international and trans-Atlantic solidarity with allies and adversaries that won the peace after World War II and, ultimately, the cold war. Such, it seems to me, is the message and the warning of D-Day.

  <LOCORG_COUNTRY>France </LOCORG_COUNTRY>  

  <PERSON>	 Chirac</PERSON>'s offer to
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON>: A poisoned chalice?
  	
  <PERSON>Katrin Bennhold</PERSON>/
  <ORGANISATION>IHT </ORGANISATION>
	
  <DATE>Friday, June 25, 2004</DATE>
  <LOCORG_CITY>PARIS</LOCORG_CITY> In the latest chapter of the simmering power struggle between
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s two most closely watched politicians,
  <PERSON> President Jacques Chirac</PERSON> told his finance minister, 
  <PERSON>Nicolas Sarkozy</PERSON>, that he was free to seek the presidency of the ruling party, traditionally seen as paving the way to the presidency.
.
The catch:
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> has to give up his ministerial duties, according to sources close to
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON>.
.
It is yet another poisoned chalice dangling in front of
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON>,
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s most popular minister, political experts said Thursday.
.
The proposal leaves the 49-year- old
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> with a dilemma: quit his job at the <LOCORG>Finance Ministry</LOCORG> after barely three months, giving the impression that he puts his career before his country, or stay put and forgo the full-blown support of the financing and campaign machine that is the
  <ORGANISATION> Union for a Popular Movement</ORGANISATION>, or
  <ORGANISATION> UMP</ORGANISATION>, ahead of the next presidential election in
  <DATE> 2007</DATE>.
.
"This is very clever maneuvering," said
  <PERSON> Brice Teinturier</PERSON>, director of political studies at the
  <LOCORG_CITY> Paris</LOCORG_CITY>-based
  <ORGANISATION> Sofres Institute</ORGANISATION>. "Given how popular
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> is, it would be very difficult for
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> to oppose his candidacy, so he is trying to stifle his ambitions without saying it."
.
Blocking
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON>'s candidacy would be politically touchy for several reasons, he said.
  <ORGANISATION> Chirac's party</ORGANISATION> suffered a humiliating defeat in recent local and European elections.
.
The current president of the party,
  <PERSON> Alain Juppé</PERSON>, was convicted in January of charges connected with illicit party financing a decade ago and is in the process of appealing.
.
  <PERSON>Sarkozy</PERSON> is the most popular member of the government at a time when both
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> and the prime minister,
  <PERSON> Jean-Pierre Raffarin</PERSON>, have seen their approval ratings slump.
.
The
  <ORGANISATION> UMP</ORGANISATION>'s leadership contest is planned for an unspecified date in the second half of November.
.
The two men met Tuesday at the presidential
  <LOCATION> Elysée Palace</LOCATION> and had a talk that was described as "very cordial" by officials close to
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON>. A <LOCORG>Finance Ministry</LOCORG> spokesman declined to comment. While a decade ago
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> was a protégé of the president, he fell out of favor in
  <DATE> 1995</DATE> when backing
  <PERSON> Edouard Balladur</PERSON> in his failed challenge of
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> for the presidency in
  <DATE> 1995</DATE>.
.
Since then,
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> has made no secret of his ambition to one day reside in the
  <LOCATION> Elysée Palace</LOCATION> himself. When asked in a television interview last year whether he thought about being president when he shaved, he famously replied: "Not only then."
.
And yet,
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON>, who is 71, has been unable to keep
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> out of government: He is too popular. Opinion polls routinely show that
  <PERSON> Sarko</PERSON>, as he is known by the French media, is the most popular minister in the country and even beats the president approval ratings. According to a poll by
  <ORGANISATION> Ifop</ORGANISATION> published this month, 49 percent of respondents prefer
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> over
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON>, who garnered 41 percent support. "
  <PERSON>Sarkozy</PERSON> is very popular," said
  <PERSON> Bruno Jeanbart</PERSON>, head of political research at the polling company
  <ORGANISATION> CSA</ORGANISATION> in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Paris</LOCORG_CITY>. "If he runs for the
  <ORGANISATION> UMP</ORGANISATION> presidency, he can easily win it.
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> clearly hopes that he won't run after all." The president knows firsthand how important the backing of a political party is in any presidential bid. In
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, where private donations to support election campaigns are largely outlawed, the parties are the only source of financing for hopeful candidates. When
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> won against
  <PERSON> Balladur</PERSON> in
  <DATE> 1995</DATE>, it was largely due to the support of the
  <ORGANISATION> UMP</ORGANISATION>'s predecessor party, the
  <ORGANISATION> Rally for the Republic</ORGANISATION>.
.
  <PERSON>Chirac</PERSON>'s proposal bears risks for both sides, analysts say.
.
The president must avoid to be seen fearing his finance minister, so any attempts to put obstacles in his way must be subtle,
  <PERSON> Teinturier</PERSON> said. "If
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> makes it look like he is forced out of government after winning the election, he could come out as the victim in the public eye," he said. It is not the first time that an apparently well-meant offer holds risks: After his successful stint as interior minister,
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> asked
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON> to take over the <LOCORG>Finance Ministry</LOCORG> at a time of sluggish economic growth, high unemployment and unpopular structural reforms. So far that has done little to dent
  <PERSON> Sarkozy</PERSON>'s popularity, though. His outspoken manner, often intruding on terrain traditionally considered the president's preserve, has irked
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> more than once. He directly contradicted
  <PERSON> Chirac</PERSON> when, as interior minister last year, he endorsed the idea of affirmative action, a concept considered taboo in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> France</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s proudly egalitarian society. And he openly criticized the ban of Muslim headscarves in public schools.

Interview in
  <ORGANISATION> The New Scientist</ORGANISATION>
 Saying no to
  <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> 	 	
.

For refusing to work on
  <PERSON> Saddam Hussein</PERSON>'s weapons programme,
  <PERSON> Hussain Al-Shahristani</PERSON> spent 11 years as a prisoner in the infamous
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> jail. As
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> struggles to rebuild, he was recently put forward as a candidate to head the interim government. He explains to
  <PERSON> Michael Bond</PERSON> why he declined. He is now calling for other scientists around the world to boycott research on all weapons of mass destruction
 
 

How well did you know
  <PERSON> Saddam Hussein</PERSON>?

I knew
  <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>closely because he was head of the
  <ORGANISATION> Atomic Energy Commission</ORGANISATION> in the
  <DATE> 1970s</DATE> even before he became president.

What was he like?

I was never impressed by him. I knew that he was a vicious man who would not hesitate to send people to be executed when they had very minor differences with him. He never impressed me with any intelligence or insight. Sometimes I thought he made a fool of himself by commenting on scientific issues. At meetings he would mostly just listen to the scientific arguments and then make a decision on what should be done, but on occasions he would comment on subjects I thought he did not have much knowledge of. What was very clear to all of us was his authoritarian style and the way he tried to dominate everybody around him. He behaved as if he was above everybody else, as if he controlled everybody and everything. His word was final and no one else could take decisions.

When he became president of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> in
  <DATE> 1979</DATE> he asked you to work on an atomic weapons programme. What happened?

I was the chief scientific adviser to the
  <ORGANISATION> Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission</ORGANISATION> when
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON> appointed himself president. He wanted to redirect our research activities from peaceful applications to what were referred to as strategic applications. I refused to work on the programme.

Was that an easy decision to make?

Fairly easy. It was clear to me that any weapons in his hands would be used against the Iraqi people. I could not find myself working on any military programme, particularly for
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON>. In taking that decision I knew what the consequences would be, but I didn't have much choice. The options were either to work with him and enable him to kill tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or to take a stand and pay the price. My religious convictions obliged me to choose the latter.

Yet many of your fellow scientists did agree to work on
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON>'s weapons programmes
.

Yes, other scientists were forced to work on them. But of course they needed some convincing: some were arrested, tortured, kept in mental hospitals and so on, and eventually they were persuaded to go back and work on the weapons programme.

What happened to you when you refused?

I was arrested in
  <DATE> December 1979</DATE>. I was interrogated and tortured for 22 days and nights. In my case they were gentler because they did not want to leave any permanent bodily marks on me. They hung me from the ceiling by my hands, which were tied behind my back. They used electric probes on sensitive parts of my body and beat me. There were others in the torture chambers who were treated far worse. In one case I witnessed a guy having holes drilled into his bones with electric drills. The most painful thing in those torture chambers was to hear the screams of children being tortured to extract confessions from their fathers.

What did they do with you then?

I was sentenced to life imprisonment and taken to
  <LOCORG_CITY> Abu Ghraib</LOCORG_CITY> prison near
  <LOCORG_CITY> Baghdad</LOCORG_CITY>. I was visited by
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON>'s step-brother, who came to my cell and expressed his disappointment in what they had done to me, and tried to persuade me to go back to my work. He told me there was a place for me at the presidential palace. I said I was not in a position to do so, both physically because I was half-paralysed after being tortured, and also because weapons research was not my specialty. Then he said that any man who was not willing to serve his country did not deserve to be alive. I said that it was our duty to serve our country, but that this was one service I could not do. At this point I was ordered to solitary confinement for 10 years. I was there from <DATE>May 1980</DATE> to <DATE>May 1990</DATE>, on
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON>'s personal orders.

Psychologically, how did you survive those years?

I tried to keep my mind busy. It was difficult. I made up mathematical problems which I then tried to solve. I spent time trying to remember scientific problems and mentally worked on developing them. Of course there was a limit to what I could do without paper and pencil, and without any reference books and so on. I wasn't allowed anything like that. I was deprived of any books, even a copy of the Koran, newspapers, even <ORGANISATION>Ba'ath party</ORGANISATION> newspapers, and radio. I was completely incommunicado. But I tried to keep my mind alive by going over whatever I knew.

How did you escape?

In those years in solitary confinement the guy responsible for my cell was a fellow prisoner in the service of the security officers. Nobody at this time was allowed to utter a word to me. This guy would come into my cell with a plate of food for me once a day and would not say anything. But one day he talked to me. He said: "
  <PERSON>Dr Hussein</PERSON>, I know all about you, the whole country respects you, if there is anything I can do let me know and I will do it." I thought it was a ploy by the intelligence officers to trick me. I thanked him and left it at that. But we grew to trust each other, and I planned my escape with him. One night in
  <DATE> February 1991</DATE>, after the invasion of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Kuwait</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, when
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Baghdad</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was blacked out and there was an aerial bombardment of the city, we took one of the cars used by the security officers and, dressed in their uniforms, made our escape. We went into hiding in the north and then I left
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> with my family and became a refugee.

Would you like to see more scientists around the world follow your example and take a stand against unethical practices?

Definitely. Scientists in particular have that moral obligation because people look up to them as the educated who know more than the average person. This puts a heavy burden on them to make sure their knowledge is used for the best of humanity and to serve mankind. I could not disagree more with any scientist who says his concern is his work and that the consequences of his discoveries are irrelevant. You have to think whether the results of your work will harm other people or help them. I don't think anyone with any sense of decency should allow himself or herself to be used as a tool to destroy other people.

Are there any areas of science that especially concern you?

I would like to seek this opportunity to call on fellow scientists around the world to refrain from working on weapons of mass destruction in particular. Such weapons will not enhance national security, but rather encourage rulers to be more aggressive and less compromising in solving international problems.

The west should take the lead in destroying any stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons in its possession and make sure that such weapons are also eliminated from the rest of the world. I would also like to see more progress made on nuclear disarmament in the coming few years.

Your decision not to work on a nuclear weapon stemmed, you said, from your religious convictions. Has your faith ever put you in conflict with your science?

On the contrary. Muslims were told by
  <PERSON> Prophet Mohammed</PERSON> that they should seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave. He also told Muslims that knowledge that is of no benefit to the people is useless knowledge. So we are encouraged not only to seek knowledge but also to make sure that the knowledge we acquire is of benefit to humanity. I do not find a conflict between my religious values and my science; on the contrary, I think it was my religious understanding to seek knowledge and make sure it is put to the good of humanity that made me take the stand I took.

What did you do in exile?

I devoted my time to helping fellow refugees. I chair the
  <ORGANISATION> Iraqi Refugee Aid Council</ORGANISATION>, which helps refugees who had to flee the country because of
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON>. I went back to
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> on a humanitarian mission on
  <DATE> 7 April 2003</DATE>, two days before the fall of the regime in
  <LOCORG_CITY> Baghdad</LOCORG_CITY>. We took humanitarian supplies, food, medicine and water to
  <LOCORG_CITY> Basra</LOCORG_CITY>.

Since then we have moved to the central and southern parts of the country, discussing with the poorest communities their most urgent needs. We have carried out scores of projects helping local clinics obtain medicines, fixing the schools, repairing water pipelines, putting in street lighting and so on.

We are also supporting families that are headed by women, and rehabilitating former political prisoners who have been deprived of any education, training or job opportunities. We are looking at the most vulnerable groups in the society and trying to create opportunities for them.

What has it been like for scientists in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> since the end of the war?

It has been very difficult for the whole population, but perhaps more so for the scientists.
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON> forced the majority of the competent scientists, professionals and technologists to work on his military programmes, to develop his weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological and nuclear. After the fall of the regime all these activities ceased, so most of these scientists have been left without jobs, even though some of them may still be paid salaries. There isn't any real work for them. It is hard for a scientist to sit around and do nothing. There are no facilities for them to work in. A primary task in the reconstruction is to rebuild those facilities and engage these scientists in a way that would really benefit the country and serve the people. I am sorry to say that there has not been much progress on this front.

Why did you turn down the opportunity to be
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY>'s interim prime minister?

I was not assured of the full cooperation of the major political parties. Without that cooperation it would be impossible to put together an interim government that would effectively prepare for and carry out general elections. Since preparing for the first fair and free elections in the country was my prime consideration for the interim government, I decided I could not accept that responsibility.

Do you see yourself getting involved in Iraqi politics sometime in the future?

I do not see myself taking part in political activity as such. But if, after the elections, I am asked by the
  <ORGANISATION> National Assembly</ORGANISATION> to take up a responsibility that I consider being of service to the country, particularly in developing science and technology for reconstruction, then I might consider accepting that.

Now for the $64,000 question: do you think there were any weapons of mass destruction in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> when the war started last year?

For all practical purposes, most of the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and facilities were dismantled and destroyed in the second half of the
  <DATE> 1990s</DATE>. This doesn't mean they were all completely destroyed. I had the impression from talking to people who were working in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Iraq</LOCORG_COUNTRY> in the second half of the
  <DATE> 1990s</DATE> that there were small quantities left: vials of germs and quantities of culture media that could be used to resume production of biological warfare agents. Of course there was the know-how and the political will if
  <PERSON> Saddam</PERSON> had been given the chance.
 
	  	


Polio in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Africa</LOCORG_CONTIN>

West and
  <LOCORG_CONTIN>central Africa</LOCORG_CONTIN> is on the brink of the largest polio epidemic in recent years, international polio experts are warning.

The case of a child being paralysed by the disease on
  <DATE> 20 May</DATE> in the troubled
  <LOCORG> Darfur</LOCORG> region of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Sudan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> was confirmed on Tuesday. This prompted an alert from the
  <ORGANISATION> Global Polio Eradication Initiative</ORGANISATION>, which consists of experts from the
  <ORGANISATION> World Health Organization</ORGANISATION> (
  <ORGANISATION>WHO</ORGANISATION>),
  <ORGANISATION> UNICEF</ORGANISATION>,
  <ORGANISATION> Rotary International</ORGANISATION> and the

The polio case is the first in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Sudan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> for three years. And the wild poliovirus is spreading rapidly in the region. Five times as many children in west and
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> central Africa</LOCORG_CONTIN> have been paralysed by polio in
  <DATE> 2004</DATE> than during the same time period in
  <DATE> 2003</DATE>.

"There is no question that the virus is spreading at an alarming pace," says
  <PERSON> David Heymann</PERSON>, the
  <ORGANISATION> WHO</ORGANISATION>'s representative for polio eradication. "The fact that the
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Sudan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> is now re-infected is concrete evidence of the need to support a massive immunisation response right across west and central
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Africa</LOCORG_CONTIN>."

He stresses: "At the beginning of
  <DATE> 2003</DATE>, only two countries in
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> sub-Saharan Africa</LOCORG_CONTIN> were polio endemic. Today, however,
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Africa</LOCORG_CONTIN> accounts for nearly 90 per cent of the global polio burden, with children now paralysed in 10 previously polio-free countries across the continent."

Fears of a major epidemic have been fuelled by the spread of polio from
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Nigeria</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to previously polio-free countries. In
  <DATE> October 2003</DATE>, three regions in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> northern Nigeria</LOCORG_COUNTRY> suspended their polio immunisation programmes amid rumours that the vaccine was laced with reproductive hormones and HIV as part of a western plot to depopulate
  <LOCORG_CONTIN> Africa</LOCORG_CONTIN>.


High season

Following tests in
  <DATE> November 2003</DATE>, two of the states subsequently re-started their programmes (
  <ORGANISATION>New Scientist</ORGANISATION>,
  <DATE> 18 November 2003</DATE>). But the state of
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Kano</LOCORG_COUNTRY> announced only in
  <DATE> May 2004</DATE> that it was resuming the programme with vaccines it had sourced from
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Indonesia</LOCORG_COUNTRY> (
  <ORGANISATION>New Scientist</ORGANISATION>,
  <DATE> 18 May 2004</DATE>). It is the epicentre of the outbreak, says
  <ORGANISATION> WHO</ORGANISATION>.

The virus in
  <LOCORG> Darfur</LOCORG> has been shown to be genetically linked to the poliovirus type endemic in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> northern Nigeria</LOCORG_COUNTRY>. Experts are now worried that a major epidemic could break out as autumn - the polio "high season" - approaches, leaving thousands of children paralysed.

"What this adds up to is a virus and an epidemic that is gathering speed rather than slowing down at the end of the low season," says
  <PERSON> Bruce Aylward</PERSON>, a
  <ORGANISATION> WHO</ORGANISATION> polio expert, according to
  <ORGANISATION> AFP</ORGANISATION>.


Especially vulnerable
 

Less than half of the children in the region are immunised against polio and many other diseases. Experts are recommending that 22 African countries hold massive, synchronised immunization campaigns in October and November to reach 74 million children.

Since the suspension of the campaigns in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Nigeria</LOCORG_COUNTRY>, 197 Nigerian children have been paralysed by polio.

Polio has already been exported from
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Nigeria</LOCORG_COUNTRY> to numerous other African countries and fears it could reach
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Sudan</LOCORG_COUNTRY> prompted the addition of the polio vaccine to an ongoing measles immunisation campaign in
  <LOCORG> Darfur</LOCORG>.

Children in
  <LOCORG> Darfur</LOCORG> are especially vulnerable to disease because of malnourishment and being displaced from their homes. Over a million people have been forced from their homes by internal conflict in
  <LOCORG_COUNTRY> Sudan</LOCORG_COUNTRY>.
