  History of England

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The name England refers to the largest and most populous of the three
main divisions of Great Britain , and dates from
after the coming of the Anglo-Saxons . Technically,
it is anachronistic to talk of a history of England before that time.
This article admits but ignores that anachronism.

The territory of England has been politically united since the tenth
century. This article centers on that territory; but before the tenth
century and after the accession of James VI of Scotland to the throne of
England in 1603 it becomes increasingly hard to distinguish English from
British history.


    Pre-Roman England

Pre-Roman England  may be determined by the
following periods: (NOTE: There is, of course, much debate amongst
experts in the field. The reader should keep in mind that all dates are
approximations.)

     8000-7000 BC Mesolithic  Period begins;
     2500 BC Neolithic  Period begins;
     1600 BC Bronze Age  begins;
     900 BC Immigration of Celtic -speaking peoples;
 400 BC Early Iron Age ;

Much evidence remains of pre-Roman  England. The Bronze Age
Stonehenge  around the 1500s BC , near
to the much earlier stone circle at Avebury
, is an extremely large although untypical
example. The south of England contains many iron-age hill forts
, surviving as systems of
concentric earthworks, from the huge Maiden Castle 
in Dorset  down to much smaller ones like Grimsbury Castle
 in Berkshire
. Dartmoor National park 
in Devon  displays much evidence of its early inhabitants,
being beset with many hut-circles, stone-rows, kistvaens
 and other visible reminders of the times.


    Roman Britain

The Romans, led by Julius Caesar , landed in
England in 55  and in 54 BC , although not as
conquerors. It was only a century later, in AD  43 ,
under the emperor Claudius  that the Roman occupation of
England  came about. In order to
protect themselves from the depredations of the Picts , the
inhabitants of Scotland  at that time, the Romans under
the emperor Hadrian  had a wall built from east to west,
Hadrian's Wall , to defend England.

In classic Roman style, the Romans constructed a highly effective
internal infrastructure to cement their military occupation, building
long, straight roads the length and breadth of the country, most of
which centred on London . For a deeper account
of the Roman occupation of Britain, see Roman Britain
. See also the Celtic tribes in the British Isles
.

The indigenous, mostly Celtic population were suppressed with customary
Roman efficiency, although numerous, and often extremely bloody,
uprisings occurred all through their occupation, the most notable that
of the Iceni  (and other tribes)
led by Boudicca , or "Boadicea," in AD 61 .
The Roman presence strengthened and weakened over the centuries, but by
the 4th Century AD their hold may best be described as tenuous.


    The Saxon Conquest

In the wake of the Romans, who had largely abandoned the islands by 410
in order to concentrate on more pressing difficulties closer to home,
what is now England was progressively settled by successive, often
complementary, waves of Angles , Saxons ,
Jutes  and Frisians , who had been partly
displaced on mainland Europe . Increasingly the erstwhile
Celtic population was pushed westwards and northwards. The
invasion/settlement of England is known as the Saxon Conquest or the
Anglo-Saxon  (sometimes "English") settlement
(though "settlement" here does not imply an absence of violence).

In the decisive Battle of Deorham , in 577
, the Cornish  Celtic people were separated
from the Welsh  by the advancing Saxons.

Beginning with the raid in 793  on the monastery at
Lindisfarne , Vikings  made many raids
on England. Starting with plundering raids, the Vikings later began to
settle in England and trade. There are many traces of Vikings in England
today, as for instance many words in the English language
; the similarity of Old English
 and Old Norse 
led to much borrowing. One Viking settlement was in York
 (which they called Jorvik ).

It was not until 936 , however, that Athelstan
 was able to evict the Cornish from Exeter
, and drew a line at the extent of his kingdom,
Wessex , at the River Tamar .


    England during the Middle Ages

The defeat of King Harold Godwinson  at the
Battle of Hastings  in 1066  at
the hands of William of Normandy , later styled William
I of England  and the subsequent Norman
 takeover of Saxon England
 led to a sea-change in
the history of the small, isolated, island state. William ordered the
compilation of the Domesday Book , which was a
survey for tax purposes of the entire population and their lands and
property.

The English middle ages  were to be characterised by
civil war, international war, occasional insurrection, and widespread
political intrigue amongst the aristocratic and monarchic elite.

Henry I , also known as Henry Beauclerc (on
account of his education), worked hard to reform and stabilise the
country and smooth the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and Norman
societies. The loss of his son, William, in the wreck of the White Ship
 in November 1120 , was to undermine his
reforms. This problem regarding succession was to cast a long shadow
over English history.

The disastrous and incompetent reign of Stephen
 (1135  - 1154 ) was
to see a major swing in the balance of power towards the feudal barons,
as England descended inexorably into civil war  and
lawlessness. In trying to appease Scottish  and Welsh
raiders on those borders, he handed over large tracts of land. Moreover,
his conflicts with his cousin, the Empress Maud ,
whom he had earlier promised recognition as heir, were his undoing: She
bided her time in France  and, in the autumn of 1139
, invaded (with her husband, Geoffrey of Anjou
 and her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester
).

Stephen was captured, and his government fell. Matilda was proclaimed
queen but was soon at odds with her subjects and was expelled from
London. The period of insurrection and civil war that followed continued
until 1148 , when Matilda returned to France. Stephen
effectively reigned unopposed until his death in 1154 , a
year after reaching an accommodation with Henry of Anjou ,
(who became Henry II ) in which peace between
them was guaranteed on the condition that the throne would be his by
succession.

The reign of Henry II represents a reversion in power back from the
barony to the monarchical state; it was also to see a similar
redistribution of legislative power from the Church, again to the
monarchical state. This period also presaged a properly constituted
legislation and a radical shift away from feudalism.

The Black Death , an epidemic of bubonic plague
that spread over all Europe, arrived in England in 1349  and
killed perhaps up to a third of the population. International excursions
were invariably against domestic neighbours: the Welsh, Irish
, Scots and the French, with the principal notable
battles being the Battle of Crécy  and the Battle
of Agincourt . In addition to this, the final
defeat of the uprising led by the Welsh prince, Owen Glendower
, in 1412  by Prince Henry (later to
become Henry V ) represents the last major
armed attempt by the Welsh to throw off English rule.

Edward III  gifted land to powerful noble
families, including many people with Royal blood in their veins. Because
land was equivelent to power in these days, this meant that these
powerful men could now try and good their claim to the Crown. The
autocratic and arrogant methods of Richard II
 only served to alienate the nobility more,
and his forceful dispossession in 1399 by Henry IV
 lay the seeds for what was to come. In the
reign of Henry VI , which began in 1422,
happenings came to a head because of his personal weaknesses and mental
instability. Unable to control the feuding nobles, he allowed outright
civil war to break out. The conflicts are known as the Wars of the Roses
 and although the fighting was very sporadic
and small, there was a general breakdown in the authority and power of
the Crown. Edward IV  went a little way to
restoring this power but the spadework was generally done by Henry VII



    Tudor England

The Wars of the Roses culminated in the eventual victory of the
relatively unknown Henry Tudor, Henry VII ,
at the Battle of Bosworth Field  in 1485
, where the Yorkist Richard III
 was slain, and the succession of the
Lancastrian House was ultimately assured. Whilst in retrospect it is
easy for us to say that the Wars of the Roses 
were now over, Henry VII could afford no such complacency. Before the
end of his reign, two pretenders would try to wrest the throne from him,
aided by remnants of the Yorkist faction at home and abroad. The first,
Lambert Simnel , was defeated at the Battle of
Stoke  (the last time an English King fought
someone claiming the Crown) and the second, Perkin Warbeck
, was hanged in 1499 after plaguing the King for a
decade.

In 1497 , Michael An Gof
 led Cornish rebels in a
march on London. In a battle over the River Ravensbourne
 at Deptford Bridge
, An
Gof fought for varied issues with their root in taxes. On June 17
, 1497  they were defeated, and Henry VII had
showed he could display military prowess when he needed to. But, like
Charles I  in the future, here was a King
with no wish to go on his travels again. The rest of his reign was
relatively peaceful, despite a slight worry over the succession when his
wife Elizabeth of York  died in 1503.

King Henry VIII  split with the Roman Catholic Church  over a question of his divorce  from Catherine of Aragon .
Though his religious position was not at all Protestant
, the resultant schism ultimately led to England
distancing itself almost entirely from Rome. A notable casualty of the
schism was Henry's chancellor, Sir Thomas More .
There followed a period of great religious and political upheaval, which
led to the Reformation , the royal expropriation of
the monasteries and much of the wealth of the church. The Dissolution of
the Monasteries

had the effect of giving many of the lower classes (the gentry
) a vested interest in the Reformation 
continuing, for to halt it would be to revive Monasticism
 and restore lands which were gifted to them during
the Dissolution.

Henry VIII had three children, all of whom would wear the Crown. The
first to reign was Edward VI of England .
Although he showed the piety and intelligence which was the hallmark of
all Tudors, he was only a boy of ten when he took the throne in 1547.
His uncle, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset
 tampered with Henry
VIII's will and obtained letters patent  giving
him much of the power of a monarch in March of that year. He took the
title of Protector. Whilst some see him as a high-minded idealist, his
stay in power culminated in a crisis in 1549 when many counties of the
realm were up in protest. Kett's Rebellion
 in Kent and The
Prayer Book Rebellion
 in Cornwall
simultaneously created a crisis during a time when invasion from
Scotland and France were feared. Somerset, disliked by the Regency
Council for his autocratic methods, was removed from power by John
Dudley , who is known as Lord
President Northumberland
.
Northumberland proceded to adopt the power for himself, but his methods
were more concilliatory and the Council accepted him.

When Edward VI lay dying of tuberculosis in 1553, Northumberland made
plans to place Lady Jane Grey  on the throne and
marry her to his son, so that he could remain the power behind the
throne. His putsch  failed and Mary I
 took the throne amidst popular demonstration
in her favour in London, which contemporaries described as the largest
show of affection for a Tudor monarch. Mary, a devout Catholic who had
been influenced greatly by the Catholic King of Spain and Holy Roman
Emperor , Charles V
, proceded to try and reimpose Catholicism on
the realm. This led to 274 burnings of Protestants, which are recorded
especially in John Foxe's Book of Martyrs
. She was highly
unpopular among her people, and the Spanish party of her husband, Philip
II  caused much resentment around Court. Mary
lost Calais , the last English possession on the
Continent, and became increasingly more unpopular (except among
Catholics) as her reign wore on. She successfully repelled a rebellion
by Sir Thomas Wyatt .

The reign of Elizabeth  restored a sort of
order to the realm following the turbulence of the reigns of Edward and
Mary when she came to the throne following the death of the latter in
1558. The religious issue which had divided the country since Henry VIII
was in a way put to rest by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement
,
which created the Church of England  in much
the same form we see it today. Much of Elizabeth's success was in
balancing the interests of the Puritans  (extreme
Protestants) and "die-hard" Catholics . She managed to
offend neither to a large extent, although she was forced to clamp down
on Catholics towards the end of her reign as the war with Catholic Spain
loomed. She feared Catholics would act as fifth columns
 and some attempts on her life had been made by
Catholics.

Elizabeth maintained relative internal peace apart from the Revolt of
the Northern Earls
 in 1569,
which was really a sign of how effective she was being in reducing the
power of the old nobility and expanding the power of her government. One
of the most famous events in English martial history occurred in 1588
when the Spanish Armada  was repelled by Sir
Francis Drake , but the war that followed was
very costly for England and only ended after Elizabeth's death.
Elizabeth's government did much to consolidate the work begun under
Thomas Cromwell  in the reign of Henry VIII, that
is in expanding the role of the government and in effecting common law
and administration throughout the realm of England.

In all, the Tudor period is seen as a decisive one which set up many
important questions which would have to be answered in the next century
and during the English Civil War . These were
questions of the relative power of Monarch and Parliament and to what
extent one should control the other. Some historians think that Thomas
Cromwell  effected a "Tudor Revolution
" in government and it
is certain that Parliament became a lot more important during his
Chancellorship. Other historians say the "Tudor Revolution
" really extended to
the end of Elizabeth's reign when the work was all consolidated.
Although the Privy Council , which was the mainstay
of Tudor government, declined after the death of Elizabeth, whilst she
was alive it was very effective.


    Religious conflict and the Civil War

An assassination attempt on the Protestant King James I
 on 5th November  1605
, the Gunpowder Plot , by a group of
Catholic conspirators, led by Guy Fawkes , served as
further fuel for antipathy in England to the catholic faith.

The English Civil War  broke out in 1642
, largely as a result of an ongoing series of conflicts
between the then King Charles I  and
Parliament . The Parliamentarian 
army was commanded by Oliver Cromwell , which
after much bloodshed and destruction, was ultimately victorious. The
capture and subsequent trial of Charles I 
led to his execution by beheading in January 1649 at Whitehall
 Gate in London.

In 1664 /65  England was swept by a visitation
of the Great Plague , and then, in 1666
, London, the timbered capital city of England, was swept by
fire, the Great Fire of London , which raged
for 5 days, destroying c. 15,000 buildings.

In the late 1600s , the Dutch 
Protestant William of Orange , William III
replaced the Catholic King James II . This
became known as the Glorious Revolution  or
'Bloodless Revolution'. However, in Scotland  and
Ireland , Catholics loyal to James II were not so
content, and a series of bloody uprisings resulted. These Jacobite
Rebellions  continued until the mid-18th
century.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NB: After the 1707 Act of Union , the histories
of Britain  and England are largely overlapping entities.
Since England was the dominant hegemony, it is assumed for the purposes
of this article that the two are largely coterminous.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The union of Scotland with England, under the Act of Union, saw Scotland
'united' with England and Wales (Wales had already been assimilated in
the 1536 Act of Union  by Henry VIII). This was
no process of harmonisation, for Scotland had effectively capitulated to
English economic pressure after the failure of the Darién scheme
. This process was lubricated in the Scottish
parliament by the self-interested political manoeuverings of the English
puppets, John Campbell , the 2nd Duke of Argyll
 and James Douglas , 2nd Duke of
Queensberry .


    The Industrial Revolution

The late 18th  and early 19th centuries
 saw considerable social upheaval as a largely
agrarian society was transformed by technological advances and
increasing mechanisation, which was the Industrial Revolution
. Much of the agricultural workforce was
uprooted from the countryside and moved into large urban centres of
production, as the steam-based production factories could undercut the
traditional cottage industries, due to economies of scale and the
increased output per worker made possible by the new technologies. The
consequent overcrowding into areas with little supporting infrastructure
saw dramatic increases in the rise of infant mortality (to the extent
that many Sunday schools for pre working age children (5 or 6) had
funeral clubs to pay for each others funeral arrangments), crime, and
social deprivation.

The transition to industrialisation was not wholly seamless for workers,
many of whom saw their livelihoods threatened by the process. Of these,
some frequently sabotaged or attempted to sabotage factories. These
saboteurs were known as "Luddites ". This view of the
Luddite history should also be set against alternative views, such as
that of E. P. Thompson .


    Political developments

The Act of Union of 1800 formally assimilated Ireland within the British
political process, and created a new country "The United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland
", uniting England,
Wales, Ireland and Scotland.

During the early 1800s , the working classes began to find
a voice; concentrations of industry led more or less inevitably to the
formation of guilds and unions, which, although at first suppressed,
eventually became powerful enough to resist. The revolutions which
spread like wildfire throughout mainland Europe during the 1840s
 did not occur in England, and Queen Victoria
's reign was largely one of
consensus, despite huge disparities in living standards between the few
rich and the multitudinous poor.

The Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921  established the Irish Free
State  (now the Republic of Ireland
) as a separate nation, leaving Northern
Ireland  as part of the United Kingdom; its
official name became "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland ".
