After months of delays and redesign, the intramural struggle over redevelopment at ground zero erupted in public during the weekend as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called for the removal from the project of the commercial leaseholder, Larry A. Silverstein, and an even broader rethinking of plans.

"It would be in the city's interest to get Silverstein out," Mr. Bloomberg was quoted as saying in an article in The Daily News yesterday. He said the plan to build as much as 10 million square feet of office space on the site might force "a kind of construction which maybe the marketplace doesn't want." The mayor suggested adding housing to the mix.

 While he seemed to back away yesterday from a direct confrontation with Mr. Silverstein, Mr. Bloomberg is jumping in at a fractious moment at the World Trade Center site. The steel framework of the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower was supposed to be heading skyward by now, but the project was radically redesigned this summer. More recently, Gov. George E. Pataki removed the Drawing Center and the International Freedom Center from the cultural building on the memorial quadrant.

By removing the Freedom Center while the matter was under consideration by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Mr. Pataki provoked an extraordinarily open show of anger and frustration at the board's Oct. 6 meeting, followed last week by the resignation of Roland W. Betts, a close friend of President Bush and one of the most influential board members. He was appointed by Mr. Pataki in 2001.

"The L.M.D.C.'s ongoing role has been severely marginalized," Mr. Betts said in his letter of resignation. At the board meeting, he even questioned whether the corporation had a future. 

Such a public rebuke of the governor might not have occurred if he were not heading into the final year of his three terms after announcing that he would not run for another term. On the other side of the coin, Mayor Bloomberg's status as a power to be reckoned with is underscored by polls showing him in a comfortable lead in his re-election bid.

Given the mayor's standing and the uncertain climate around ground zero, his opinions could reverberate deeply. As a practical matter, however, the mayor cannot evict Mr. Silverstein, who is counting on $4.65 billion in insurance payments to finance reconstruction. Nor can the mayor dictate that housing be included in the trade center project. The site is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the planning process has been directed by the development corporation, a city-state agency that Mr. Pataki effectively controls.

"I believe we're certainly on track, and I don't see any possibility of revisiting the master site plan," John P. Cahill, the governor's chief of staff and the highest-ranking downtown development official, said yesterday.

Mr. Silverstein went so far yesterday as to call the mayor's remarks confusing, since the administration had participated at every stage in the development of the plans.

"The mayor has frequently urged us to proceed as quickly as possible," Mr. Silverstein said in a statement. "I believe that New Yorkers want to see rapid rebuilding and not yet another exercise in planning and re-planning."

Mayor Bloomberg's unusually strong remarks, made to the editorial board of The News on Friday, come at a time when Democrats are charging that he has not been involved enough in the planning efforts downtown. His administration spent a good deal of effort and political capital until June seeking to build a stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. Part of that calculation meant steering clear of making demands about downtown so as not to irritate politicians whose help he sought.

"You should always keep asking and changing as the marketplace changes," Mr. Bloomberg told reporters yesterday when questioned about the planning of the trade center site. "And if people come up with better ideas, then I think we have to be open to them."

"There is a question of how much demand there is for additional office space and how much demand there is for residential," the mayor said, "and I think it's time to see what the marketplace really wants and perhaps we can better accommodate that."

"We've worked well with Larry Silverstein so far," he said, "but I just don't think that we're making as much progress as we should."

A recent Pace University poll of 518 Lower Manhattan residents found 93 percent saying that building new affordable housing was somewhat or very important, while 76 percent felt that way about restoring the office space destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001.

Mr. Bloomberg's reservations echo public impatience with the pace of redevelopment, though some important but subtle steps have been taken this fall to prepare for construction. These include plans to remove ventilating shafts from the memorial plaza and a tentative agreement on setting the plaza's height relative to nearby structures.

State officials said it would add more years to the process to remove Mr. Silverstein and to replan the project with residential space, even if doing so is legally possible. As the leaseholder, Mr. Silverstein has already paid about $500 million in rent to the Port Authority,

For his part, the mayor said he was standing by the master plan, with this significant condition: "It's a question of what each of the buildings on that plan are used for, and it's a question of what order they get built."

The Bloomberg administration signed the World Trade Center redevelopment agreement of Nov. 24, 2004, in which the city, the authority, Silverstein Properties and the development corporation agreed "to comply with and abide by the provisions" of the general project plan, which included "the development of approximately 10 million square feet of Class A commercial office space."

A spokesman for the Port Authority, Steve Coleman, said: "The city has been at the table for the last four years at every single meeting. The mayor has been at every single event having to do with the rebuilding effort. So it's surprising to us that these issues are now being raised."

As for the prospect of residential development on the site, Mr. Coleman said the authority's charter would have to be amended first by the New York and New Jersey Legislatures.

As for removing Mr. Silverstein as the commercial developer, Mr. Coleman said, "He's been abiding by the terms of the lease and, without protracted litigation, there are probably limited ways we can get him out of the lease."

Mr. Bloomberg's comments caught aides to the governor off guard, and they expressed chagrin that they were so "unchoreographed," as one official described them.

This official, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to be drawn into a public fight with the mayor, said Mr. Bloomberg's remarks could prove useful in pushing the process along faster. He also said that if the mayor argues too forcefully that the market downtown will not sustain so much office space or if he creates the impression that the master plan will be reworked yet again, he might scare off tenants and further delay Mr. Silverstein's rebuilding.

As proof of progress, Stefan Pryor, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, noted yesterday that ground had been broken in the last two months for the PATH terminal, designed by Santiago Calatrava at the trade center site, and for the nearby Fulton Street Transit Center, which is to improve the connection between 12 subway lines. Demolition scaffolding is also rising around the contaminated former Deutsche Bank building opposite ground zero.

"And more will soon be under way," Mr. Pryor added. "We remain on schedule to break ground on both the Freedom Tower and the memorial by the spring."

Fernando Ferrer, the Democratic mayoral candidate, said yesterday of Mr. Bloomberg's remarks: "He now appears to be interested in the gaping hole that is still ground zero. Except for one problem: This was on his watch. He and the governor have allowed that to remain that way for four years. The mayor owns this problem."
