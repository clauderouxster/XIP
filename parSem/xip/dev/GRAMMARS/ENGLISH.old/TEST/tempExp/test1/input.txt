Mark,
I heard back from Frederique. Her team is available on October 4th.
As I indicated I would not be able to reconnect with you until today, since I was on vacation on Friday.
Kind regards. Gabriele

Hello Laurent,
Can you and your team, please confirm if October 4 from 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM PDT will work for you all?
I will be on vacation beginning Sept. 23 - Oct. 1 and want to make sure that I close
 the open item with respects to Matt Archibald's availability.
Regards,
Mark

Matt, 
 
Thanks for taking care of this request; our team is available July 28  from 9:00 - 10:30 to discuss
 the preliminary modeling findings with you, Jack and Scott. If there are other individuals that you think 
 should be included, feel free to include. 

My only request is that I know who they are (title/function) within 
the organization in advance so we are prepared to address any 
questions they may have. 
Mark 

Mark, 
Thanks for setting this up. As I will be on holiday at that date make  sure you copy Frederique,
 Caroline, Agnes and Gabriele on the conf call details or any other discussion you are having with the customer. 
 Thanks 
 Laurent 

Dear Colleagues,
As agreed, we would like to return to you and propose a follow up call. The topics we would like to discuss in priority are:
 -Litigation and potential opportunities for our text analysis technologies
 - Processing of digital forms in support of CALM and FAS applications
Frederique Segond will join us on our side.
She is responsible for our Parsing & Semantics research area and has an interest in Ligitation applications. 
We would propose the following dates Wednesday 16th, Wednesday 23rd or Thursday 24th at 11am (EST).
Please let us know,
Best regards,
Jean-Pierre

I can also conference in. Morning would work best for me. Thanks. Gabriele

I will be on the west coast next week but can carve out time for a phone conference.
Cheryl, I will look for a Outlook meeting notice. Thanks
Gil

Jean-Pierre:
Gil is on vacation this week, and is likely to have a very busy schedule next week.
Also, he's actually located in California.
I am located in Rochester (80 Linden Oaks), so if you have a chance, we could meet briefly while you are here
 (Right now I'm open, but do have a few things that I'm scheduling).
Depending on Gil's schedule, maybe we could tie him in by phone.
I will be talking with him probably on Monday on some other matters, so can touch base beforehand.
I know that we had talked about setting up a demo, so I'll figure out what next steps should be.
Let me know your schedule/what time you have free.
Cheryl

Ivy,
Thanks for this.  Would a conference call either next Monday (3rd October) 9:30-10:00 EST or next
 Thursday (6th October) 10:00-10:30 EST work for you?
Best regards,
Peter

Peter, unfortunately, neither of the suggested times work for me.
I have a lot of availability on Wednesday. would that work for your team?
Ivy

Unfortunately Wednesday is the one day I can't do Ivy.
What is your availability for the rest of the week?
We will try to make sure we work to that.
Thanks,
Peter

Ivy,
Many, many apologies.  Unfortunately it remains complicated because Frederique is not available that day.
 Shall we look to the following week in that case?  We are generally okay that week outside of Friday 14th.
Hope that will work for you,
Best regards,
Peter
