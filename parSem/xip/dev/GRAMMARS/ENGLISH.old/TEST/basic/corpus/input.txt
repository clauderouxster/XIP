Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday.

The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.

Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial.

Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom.

"The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client", Bellows told the court.

"Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property.

It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others".

Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired, "You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this"?

"Yes, your honor", replied Bellows.

"What this amounts to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case.

There is a conflict among the defendants".

WASHINGTON, JULY 24

President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio.

The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.

Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port, Mass., a White House spokesman said the address text still had "quite a way to go" toward completion.

Asked to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White House press secretary, replied, "I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts".

Salinger said the work President Kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city.

The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns, who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence "by unfair and fundamentally illegal means".

Karns said that the cases involved a matter "of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence" of the 50 persons.

He said evidence was obtained "in violation of the legal rights of citizens".

In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been "
unable to make a case".

Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler, special prosecutor.

Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them before the grand jury.

Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure constituted intimidation.

Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning.

Karns said it was a "wrongful act" for Wexler to take statements "privately and outside of the grand jury room".

He said this constituted a "very serious misuse" of the Criminal court processes.

"Actually, the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court", said Karns, who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court.

Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons.

Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with "complementary" miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another.

The cases involved judges in the 33d, 24th, and 42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward, and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.

The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns.

Two other cases also were under advisement.

After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he would dismiss them.

WASHINGTON, FEB. 9

President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs.

The President, in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships, build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child health care and general medical research.

The aged care plan, similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator, a fight on Capitol hill.

It was defeated in Congress last year.

It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes.

The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year.

The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each.

Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system.

The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1, 1963, if the plan were approved, because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs.

Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963. 

Both figures would go higher in later years.

Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years. 

These would be paid for out of general, not payroll, taxes.

The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems: 

1. Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.

2. Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital.

A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a "unit formula" allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit.

3. Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient.

4. Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness.

The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged.

He said his plan is designed to "meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay".

"This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs", he said, "and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.

"This is not a program of socialized medicine.

It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed.

Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital".

The plan does not cover doctor bills.

They would still be paid by the patient.

Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships, and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.

The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care.

Moreover, he said, many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs.

The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students.

The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships, based on need, of up to $2,000 a year per student.

In addition, the government would pay a $1,000 "cost of education" grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants.

Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966.

The President recommended federal "matching grants" totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones.

In the area of "community health services", the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction.

He asked for another 10 million dollar "initial" appropriation for "stimulatory grants" to states to improve nursing homes.

He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.

In the child health field, the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau.

He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute.

The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.

He did not say by how much.

For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions, in matching grants for building research facilities.

The President said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine.

The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people, knowledge, services, facilities, and the means to pay for them".

Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines.

Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan.

Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.

Senate Republican Leader Dirksen [Ill.] and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck [Ind.] said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance.

Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first.

House Speaker Sam Rayburn [D., Tex.] called the Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing", but made no prediction on its fate in the House.

WASHINGTON, FEB. 9

Acting hastily under White House pressure, the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief.

Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote.

A number of scattered "ayes" and "noes" was heard.

Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency.

In the last eight years, all Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.

The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse [D., Ore.] in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961.

OSLO 

The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer, franker, and wider discussions, animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings.

This has been a working session of an organization that, by its very nature, can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes.

In Oslo, the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.

This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the "colonialist" powers and those who have never, or not for a long time, had such problems.

The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing them, and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about, has been conspicious by its absence.

In the case of Portugal, which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension.

The general, remarkably courteous, explanation has left basic positions unchanged, but there has been no explosion in the council.

There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes, since a new ad-hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.

Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive.

Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance, is today closer to the NATO line.

On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.

One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as "inconclusive".

But he hastened to add that, if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy.

A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited.

The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days, despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity, that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots.

The Secretary of State himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months.

But where the core of NATO is concerned, the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance, "cornerstone" of its foreign policy, but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters.

The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole.

The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction, wherever it takes place around the globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection.

This increase in the "threshold", as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come.

Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down, but never completely fulfilled.

WASHINGTON

The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time. 

There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.

The United States, State Department officials explain, now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam.

They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this.

The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated.

But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.

The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference.

This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make.

It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration.

Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.

But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises:

How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ?

Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union.

He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.

It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it.

They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans, if they had been in power, would have made "amateurish and monumental blunders" in Cuba.

One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score.

His reply, he said, was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now.

But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first.

The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton (R) of Kentucky, chairman of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination.

Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard, Boston University, Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators.

This group pleads with the administration to "give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups".

It recommends that the United States "seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds".

Mr. Nixon, for his part, would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation.

But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that, if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba, it would not be tolerated.

Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos, almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected, generally, the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors.

Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels, a high official source disclosed, that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration.

Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements.

Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed.

But thus far there has been no response in kind.

Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations.

In Laos, the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture.

Again and again it asked the Communists to "freeze" the military situation in Laos.

But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.

And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up, administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a "great service" and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos.

But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.

(Some SEATO nations disagreed, however.)

There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.

The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos.

The pro-Western government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma "neutralist" government, never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.

There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt.

If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt was too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.

One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright (D) of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by "encouraging the removal" of Prince Souvanna.

WASHINGTON

The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.

The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the "vitality of the nation".

In an important assertion of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.

The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.

The President has also called upon the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts "in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.

Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett, a special assistant of the Attorney General, as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime.

His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.

Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959, about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.
