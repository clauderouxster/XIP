German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer arrived in the Middle East today
for talks to try to establish a cease-fire in the nearly 11-month
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.  But leaders there are not in
the mood for reconciliation.  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon today
repeated his view that the Palestinians are not partners for peace, and
in the streets of the West Bank and Gaza today, the violence continued,
as NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports.

In the southern Gaza Strip, thousands of Palestinians turned out for
funeral ceremonies at the home of the latest victims, militant activist
Samir Abu Zeid and his two young children.  Israelis and Palestinians
dispute how the killing happened.  Palestinian neighbors said they saw an
Israeli missile strike Abu Zeid's home and accused Israel of another
assassination.  But other eyewitnesses saw no evidence of such an attack.
Israel's army first suggested that a Palestinian-launched mortar had gone
astray, then it said it believed Abu Zeid had been making a bomb that
exploded prematurely.  Friends say Abu Zeid was known as a master
bombmaker and headed a group that's attacked Israeli army posts and
settlements.  Muslim militants at today's funeral vowed revenge for Abu
Zeid's death.

An organization calling itself the International Committee for Art and
Peace says it is holding a Marc Chagall painting hostage.  The ransom:
peace in the Middle East.  The painting was stolen two months ago from
New York's Jewish Museum.  Now the museum says it has received a letter
from the group claiming they have the 1914 painting, thought to be worth
about a million dollars.  The New York Times reported that investigators
do not believe the ransom letter is a fake.  According to authorities,
the letter had details about the painting that could only come from
someone who had it.

Adults and administrators aren't to blame for all our obsessions.  On
some level, we're the ones giving ourselves the stress.  From the
outside, it seems like we want the stress.  We willingly sign up for
these summer courses.  The work just never stops.  We finish the school
year and dive back into books and grades before we notice we were
stressed out in the first place.  But see, no one is stopping us.  No one
thinks what we are doing is crazy.  They probably think it's good.
Parents, teachers, they all want us to be competitive and get into the
best college or start the best career track.  The last thing they want to
do is discourage our ambitions.  What's hard to figure out is how these
ambitions showed up in the first place.

In southwest Colorado, river rafters are running into barbed wire, shot
guns and lawsuits.  Water has long been a divisive issue in the West.
Now a boom in both tourism and population is creating new conflicts, and
Colorado has become a test case in the battle to determine whether rivers
are public thoroughfares or private property.  NPR's Elizabeth Arnold has
this report.

The lake fork of the Gunnison River is a narrow, mild reach of water
through canyons and cottonwoods, public land and people's back yards.
Yosi Lutwak has owned a ranch here for 23 years, and says what
water flows through his back yard is his property.

White water rafting, kayaking and canoeing have nearly tripled over the
last decade, coupled with a rise in second homes along waterways.
Disputes over access are occurring all over the country even in states
where the right to float is clear.  From California to Virginia, new
paddlers and new waterfront landowners are crowding each other out.
Voters argue they have the right of downstream passage.  Property owners
complain of noise, litter and loss of privacy.

Ten years ago, I got published for the very first time.  I wrote an essay
about the time my husband and I took a long weekend away from our
children.  I sent the essay to a local magazine, but I never heard back.
Months later, I happened to be reading the magazine when I saw a headline
that seemed to describe my essay.  My heart quickened.  Had I finally
been published?  I looked for the byline, but I couldn't find it.  My
eyes went to the illustration, a couple swirling on a dance floor.
Instead of whispering sweet nothings, they were talking baby talk.  This
was my work.  But no.  How could it be mine when the couple in the
drawing was white and I'm black?
