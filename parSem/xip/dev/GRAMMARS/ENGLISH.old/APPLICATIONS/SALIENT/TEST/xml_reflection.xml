			<awapara>Pre-subject reflections</awapara>
			<awapara>My first lecture started 13 March 2015. We were placed in the new building 8 lecture rooms and Natalia was standing out front ready to commence her class. I walked into this subject ill-prepared. I didn't take any time to review the subject outline nor did I log onto UTS Online to review any supporting information to provide context, I walked into class like a blank canvas. So simply put I didn't have an agenda or set expectations for this subject and that was kind of exciting.</awapara>
			<awapara>Up at the front of the lecture was the first slide projected stating 'Take Responsibility' and 'Responsibility Ahead' with a 'Welcome to Managing, Leading and Stewardship'. I had no idea what this course was about but I was certain it had something to do with responsibility and leaders. The second slide was displayed and Natalia started to question the students 'how do you make decisions.' I reflected on this and felt decision making was like second nature, yes I over-thought my decisions whether it was personal or professional but I never thought of the act of having to justify my decisions. Oddly enough I found it quite empowering to hear Natalia state the following "Real life dilemmas often present choices between equally unfavorable or disagreeable alternatives. You need to know how to make judgments, why you made the judgment and be accountable for your judgment". I found this statement powerful, in fact enlightening. I felt that it gave me confidence to make my decisions so long as I was able to justify my actions and I was willing to accept accountability for it.  Accountability was the key to it. It then made me wonder how often do leaders accept accountability? I reflected upon my own experience with working with leaders and I'd have to say minimal. How do you accept ownership for your decisions, well I think one of the key aspects to accountability is how ethical your decision making process is.</awapara> 
			<awapara>Ethics has a broad definition and it means different things to different people. Natalia touched on a point during the first lecture, that reputable corporations have made decisions based on whether it's legal not whether it is ethical. Some examples of organisations that do things 'lawfully' but not so ethically are James Hardie with Meredith Hellicar Chair of James Hardie "we've done nothing illegal" or Tony Heyward CEO of BP oil spill impact stating "Who cares? Job's done". This made me really wonder why is it acceptable to act unethically? Why have Corporations and their leaders not been held accountable for making decisions in an unethical manner? What is influencing them to make these decisions? Globally how will we overcome years of conditioning and acceptance of such bad behaviour? When will enough be enough? During the first tutorial we unpacked Murdoch's scandal â€“ Ethical breaches at News of the World.  The article highlighted the leadership decisions made and the behaviour that was condoned which led to the demise of News of the World. In my humble opinion I believe Rupert Murdoch's ethos of a "do-whatever-it-takes-to-win-attitude" led to such poor and disappointing behaviour of employees. Many management practices talk about leaders setting the tone of the corporation and to 'walk the talk'. I believe he did set the environment for such behaviours. It made me wonder if those employees who obtained information through questionable practices were monetarily rewarded? Did the organisational system tacitly condition these unethical behaviours? Now Murdoch has changed his ethos to ethically "do-whatever-it-takes-to-win-attitude" by implementing a Code of Ethics. It made me wonder does Murdoch now 'walk the Code of Ethics talk' or is this considered lip service to keep the public satisfied?</awapara>
			<awapara>During the lecture another question was asked of us 'Is Adolf Hitler an example of a good/effective leader'? There was some debate about this, some felt he was and some felt he wasn't. I felt this was a really good example to help me understand what a good/effective leader is. Yes Adolf Hitler achieved what he set out to do, but at what cost. I applied this to an example at work. I am a HR Business Partner and support clients. This generally means partnering with leaders to achieve business outcomes through employees. I have a leader let's call him Joe Bloggs who is new to the business. He is still in the midst of setting up his corporate structure. He's in here to do a job and the Regional Managing Director appointed him to do this job. However I have learnt that he may be excelling his Key Performance Indicators by winning sales but he is damaging the corporate culture through his aggressive, insensitive, calculated and borderline bullying and discriminating behaviours which are impacting employee morale. I'm not saying he is like Adolf Hitler, what I am saying is that it brought me another level of awareness, he was overachieving his sales targets but he was demonstrating questionable behaviour. Does this make him an effective good leader? In my opinion the answer was no. I continued to contemplate how I was going to tactfully address this questionable behaviour.</awapara>
			<awapara>So what is driving leaders to act this way and make these types of questionable decisions? My main assumption at this point was based on corporate structure, power and politics and lack of severe consequences when unethical behaviour is demonstrated. I felt it was crucial for me to understand this so that I can better understand and be aware when I am making or supporting the making of decisions that may potentially be deemed unethical. "The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything" Albert Einstein. This quote really resided with me. It made me wake up to myself again. I've been working in the corporate environment for almost eight years now and realized I am a product of being institutionalized - somewhat numb. I personally felt that if I didn't participate in what I would consider as not such ethical behavioural then that separated me from being a part of that. However Einstein highlights knowing without doing anything is how the world will be destroyed. I applied this to my current work environment. I have a level of accountability to ensure employees felt safe in their working environment, yes it's somewhat a legislative 'duty of care' requirement but for me it was more than that. For me personally it is about understanding that we live in a civilized society were we are to treat each other with respect and dignity not because it's the 'nice' thing to do but because it's the 'right' thing to do. So I made a decision to act ethically and not be a silent bystander at work. I took some accountability and approached the Regional Managing Director. I provided a summary of events to him which contained examples of when Joe Bloggs was acting in an untoward way to employees and how it was affecting employee morale, team work and as a result hurting our customers and brand. The Regional Managing Director facilitated a phone call immediately and had me participate in the discussion whereby Joe Bloggs was asked to explain himself and subsequently educated that despite Key Performance Indicator success this did not equal mistreating employees. This matter was addressed as a conversation because the sad fact is no employees made a formal complaint about Joe Bloggs. They stated that they feared losing their jobs or didn't want to create tension in the workplace. Previous to this example, I had other employees approach me about other matters and whether they should report it to the Ethics department. But when it came to crunch time, they never did. They were always reluctant. They were concerned that formally reporting this will jeopardize their career prospects, salary increase, bonuses etc despite the reassurance that it wouldn't. It really made me wonder why is ok?  The reality is we have a lot more bystanders than those actually doing the evil.</awapara>
			<awapara>Mid-subject reflections</awapara> 
			<awapara>During  one of the lectures I was first introduced to Values Based Management (VBM). This was something new to me as I have not heard about it before. From what I can gather VBM is about managing for the long term by maximizing value, not profit.  I wondered are organizations that are aligned to VBM practices more successful than those that are not? Once again I thought about my current workplace. Upon reflection I realized that my workplace does not adopt VBM practices. In fact the organisation is very short term in their thinking and reactive. Although we attempt at practicing good corporate citizenship behaviours we do not invest in our employees like other competitors would. Hence we have an attraction and retention issue. The success factor at this organisation is purely based on numbers i.e. profit. Sadly what this means is that if numbers aren't looking good each quarter cost cutting exercises are implemented. This has impacted employee morale. It really made me wonder when will there be a shift in short term thinking to long term thinking. Does this really exist or is it nirvana we are talking about?</awapara>
			<awapara>During our tutorial we discussed the 'Strategies for Responsible Restructuring' paper.  This article really cemented that my current workplace considers 'employees as costs'. It was such a positive refreshing paper to read about companies that do restructure responsibly.  It made me wonder why we don't ever hear about organizations that restructure responsibly.  I have registered myself to three or four different online HR newsletters and never have I read an article on responsible restructuring; it has always been about 'Company ABC expected to lay off 400 employees'.  During our tutorial we conducted a role play exercise. This exercise was to role play Bill Quinn (Managing Director for King Gee) who was assigned by parent company Sara Lee to close down the Kempsey factory. This resulted in impacting the Kempsey community and employees losing their jobs. I volunteered myself to be the Head of HR in this role play. I was supporting the student (Emily) role playing Bill Quinn. We were outside going through our approach of how to deliver this awful news to employees. We thought how would we prefer to hear this type of news, what will be the employees pain points, what things can do to ensure we address these pain points as much as possible,  how can we deliver this information so it is clear but also personable etc. It was a really difficult task and I could see Emily getting really nervous and sick to her stomach. I started getting nervous and sick to my stomach. From this exercise what I learnt most was not how it impacted employees but more so about the leaders role. It made me empathise with what leaders have to go through when they are delivering bad news. It is a high pressured role with high expectations; leaders require strength, guts and accountability.  After the exercise, Natalia informed us that Bill's mantra to deliver this news was to ensure that his employees were treated with dignity and respect. This resonated with me because in my early career in HR one of my senior colleagues taught me that exact same mantra and I pass on that same mantra to the leaders I work with, however sometimes it can be a struggle when I encounter leaders who are destructive.</awapara>
			<awapara>I attended the information session held by Natalia on the 24 April, there were two keynote speakers who talked about organisations that had strategic practices for sustainable outcomes. Two key highlights that I learnt from that information session were about leaders. One aspect was Leadership was about the impact you have on others, this was a powerful statement to me, because most of the time when you read about leadership it talks about having followers and the influence you have over people to follow you. This statement however was powerful because it makes a leader accountable for their actions and the impact it has on people. It gelled with me rather well, that when I went back into the workplace I felt the desire to mention it to one of the Vice Presidents I support, hoping that by planting that seed one day I will get to see the benefits. The second aspect was based on the work that Nigel discussed about his work on coaching leaders to reach a level of mindfulness. This was interesting work to me and hearing that places such as Google and Commbank were providing this support to Executives was comforting to hear.</awapara> 
			<awapara>Final reflections</awapara>
			<awapara>Upon finishing the subject, I honestly felt it was a worthwhile subject to do. It wasn't just a subject that educates you on theories and case studies, it helped you understand you as a person and how you would make decisions if you were put into difficult situations. I really enjoyed hearing about a case, then placed into the case and developing an action plan on how to manage that case. In particular I really enjoyed hearing about the pharmaceutical case study in our last tutorial. It was exciting to be given a scenario to think on your feet. Reflecting back on the entire subject, I myself personally felt I would have liked to see myself contribute verbally more to the wider class. I have no idea why I don't, but most of the times I prefer to sit quietly, listen, reflect and then contribute.  I really respected the subject content as it felt authentic and that aligned to my personal values and how I operate as a human being. This led me to think about authentic leadership, you can't buy that, its genuine and you can't fake it. This was the type of leader I will be. I reflected back to my workplace and we recently had a visit from the Executive Vice President of EMEA and APAC, I observed his behaviour in the town hall meeting. I found him to be such an interesting and confident Executive Vice President, he wasn't like the other three leaders that I had observed before and the difference was authenticity. He didn't turn up to the meeting with PowerPoint slides to talk at the company's performance. He just stood in front of a mass audience and started with introducing himself, he then opened up to the floor after a short introduction and stating that this time was dedicated to you. He responded to every query that was asked of him. He stated that he can see that the challenge for ANZ is the Key Accounts and he stated 'let me come and help you' it was rare for me to hear that type of commitment from such a high up leader and you could feel it was genuine. There was nothing exciting about the meeting it was like a casual conversation between people, it felt real and for that reason I found it inspirational. This has been the only time I have felt inspired working for this organisation. Since his departure work/life has gone back to the norm. This reaffirmed that maybe this workplace wasn't aligned to my values and this workplace was just a stepping stone into finding a workplace I felt I made valuable contributions towards. But where there any workplaces that perceived employees as assets and thought of the long term future?</awapara>
			<awapara>I was scrawling through some current Harvard Business Review Jan-Feb and March 2015 issues. The Jan-Feb 2015 article 'Where Boards Fall Short' was an article highlighting that Boards aren't delivering on their core mission: providing strong oversight and strategic support for management's efforts to create long term value. This article identifies that there is a problem 'focus too much on maximizing short term results'. This was such a refreshing article to read, because to be honest I was a little cynical that these types of organisations did exist. When I talked to Vice Presidents and Directors in company I asked casually asked them why we exist and without a doubt most of them responded with to make money for the shareholders. The article states The Board are not spending enough time discussing long term strategy and having the relevant expertise about what the organisation does and how they do it. It recommended that attracting the right Board members, paying the directors more and then having the Board engage in more long term investors. The second article reviewed was titled 'Corporate Governane 2.0'. In the article it highlights that it was ironic that companies have to private in order to think long term. Quote from Dell "Privatization has unleashed the passion of our team member who has freedom to focus on first innovating for customers in a way that would not have been possible when striving to meet the quarterly demands of wall street". It then goes onto state that managers should actively engage with shareholders from a functional perspective (what are we all trying to achieve) rather than an issue by issue reactionary perspective. This model was moving towards a stakeholder model. It continues to state that the power of shareholders has increased significantly over the last 10 years in particular the U.S; it also provides hope that there will be shift and a change in the way businesses conduct themselves for long term sustainability. Reading these two recent articles gave me some hope that the change is starting I look forward to seeing the shift and working through the shift in the near future.</awapara>
