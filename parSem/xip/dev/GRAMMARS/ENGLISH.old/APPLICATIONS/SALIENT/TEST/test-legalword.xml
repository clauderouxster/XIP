The proliferation and prominence of social media in contemporary Australia has stimulated discussion regarding the relationship between social media and the law. In particular, some academics have considered whether social media could be used to address wavering public confidence in the judiciary, which is often construed as an autonomous institution disconnected from the public. Drawing upon the scholarship, this paper will argue that Australian court staffshould consider using social media to increase confidence in the judiciary. It will suggest that the courts can achieve this increased public confidence through using social media to enhance their transparency, educate the public about court operations, and explain the legal rationale behind contentious decisions. However, this paper will also reason that the courts need to exercise caution when using social media. The court staff managing social media profiles must ensure that the posted content is reaching the general public, and does not undermine the integrity of the judiciary.Ultimately, this paper will conclude that although the use of social media can be challenging for the courts, the increased public confidence in the judiciary that it can yield is needed.
