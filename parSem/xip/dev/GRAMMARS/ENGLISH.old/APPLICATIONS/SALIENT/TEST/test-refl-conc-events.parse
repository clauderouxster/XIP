1> Pre-subject reflections.
2> My first lecture started 13 March 2015.
3> We were placed in the new building 8 lecture rooms and Natalia was standing out front ready to commence her class.
TRIPLET(ARG1,X,PRED,placed,ARG2,We)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Natalia,PRED,standing,ARG2,front ready)
4> I walked into this subject ill-prepared.
5> I didn't take any time to review the subject outline nor did I log onto UTS Online to review any supporting information to provide context, I walked into class like a blank canvas.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,take,ARG2,review)
TRIPLET(ARG1,any time,PRED,review,ARG2,the subject outline)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,take,ARG2,any time)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,review,ARG2,any supporting information)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,review,ARG2,any supporting information)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,review,ARG2,the subject outline)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,review,ARG2,the subject outline)
6> So simply put I didn't have an agenda or set expectations for this subject and that was kind of exciting.
TRIPLET(ARG1,that,PRED,was,ARG2,kind)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,have,ARG2,an agenda)
7> Up at the front of the lecture was the first slide projected stating 'Take Responsibility' and 'Responsibility Ahead' with a 'Welcome to Managing, Leading and Stewardship'.
8> I had no idea what this course was about but I was certain it had something to do with responsibility and leaders.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,was,ARG2,certain)
TRIPLET(ARG1,this course,PRED,was,ARG2,what)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,had,ARG2,no idea)
9> The second slide was displayed and Natalia started to question the students 'how do you make decisions'.
TRIPLET(ARG1,you,PRED,make,ARG2,decisions)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Natalia,PRED,question,ARG2,the students)
TRIPLET(ARG1,X,PRED,displayed,ARG2,The second slide)
10> I reflected on this and felt decision making was like second nature, yes I over-thought my decisions whether it was personal or professional but I never thought of the act of having to justify my decisions.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,felt,ARG2,decision)
TRIPLET(ARG1,my decisions,PRED,was,ARG2,professional)
TRIPLET(ARG1,my decisions,PRED,was,ARG2,personal)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,reflected,ARG2,on this)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,thought,ARG2,of the act)
11> Oddly enough I found it quite empowering to hear Natalia state the following Real life dilemmas often present choices between equally unfavorable or disagreeable alternatives.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,found,ARG2,it)
12> You need to know how to make judgments, why you made the judgment and be accountable for your judgment .
TRIPLET(ARG1,You,PRED,need,ARG2,make)
TRIPLET(ARG1,You,PRED,need,ARG2,know)
TRIPLET(ARG1,you,PRED,made,ARG2,the judgment)
13> I found this statement powerful, in fact enlightening.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,found,ARG2,enlightening)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,found,ARG2,this statement)
14> I felt that it gave me confidence to make my decisions so long as I was able to justify my actions and I was willing to accept accountability for it.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,gave,ARG2,me)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,accept,ARG2,accountability)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,justify,ARG2,my actions)
15> Accountability was the key to it.
TRIPLET(ARG1,Accountability,PRED,was,ARG2,the key,to it)
16> It then made me wonder how often do leaders accept accountability?
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,made,ARG2,me)
TRIPLET(ARG1,leaders,PRED,accept,ARG2,accountability)
17> I reflected upon my own experience with working with leaders and I'd have to say minimal.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,reflected,ARG2,upon my own experience)
18> How do you accept ownership for your decisions, well I think one of the key aspects to accountability is how ethical your decision making process is.
TRIPLET(ARG1,you,PRED,accept,ARG2,ownership)
19> Ethics has a broad definition and it means different things to different people.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,has,ARG2,a broad definition)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Ethics,PRED,means,ARG2,different things)
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,means,ARG2,different things)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Ethics,PRED,has,ARG2,a broad definition)
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,means,ARG2,different things,to different people)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Ethics,PRED,means,ARG2,different things,to different people)
20> Natalia touched on a point during the first lecture, that reputable corporations have made decisions based on whether it's legal not whether it is ethical.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,'s,ARG2,not)
21> Some examples of organisations that do things 'lawfully' but not so ethically are James Hardie with Meredith Hellicar Chair of James Hardie we've done nothing illegal or Tony Heyward CEO of BP oil spill impact stating Who cares?
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,done,ARG2,nothing)
TRIPLET(ARG1,of organisations,PRED,do,ARG2,things)
22> Job's done .
23> This made me really wonder why is it acceptable to act unethically?
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,made,ARG2,me)
24> Why have Corporations and their leaders not been held accountable for making decisions in an unethical manner?
25> What is influencing them to make these decisions?
TRIPLET(ARG1,them,PRED,make,ARG2,these decisions)
26> Globally how will we overcome years of conditioning and acceptance of such bad behaviour?
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,overcome,ARG2,years)
27> When will enough be enough?
28> During the first tutorial we unpacked Murdoch's scandal - Ethical breaches at News of the World.
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,unpacked,ARG2,Murdoch 's scandal)
29> The article highlighted the leadership decisions made and the behaviour that was condoned which led to the demise of News of the World.
TRIPLET(ARG1,which,PRED,led,ARG2,to the demise)
30> In my humble opinion I believe Rupert Murdoch's ethos of a do-whatever-it-takes-to-win-attitude led to such poor and disappointing behaviour of employees.
31> Many management practices talk about leaders setting the tone of the corporation and to 'walk the talk'.
TRIPLET(ARG1,Many management practices,PRED,talk,ARG2,about leaders)
TRIPLET(ARG1,about leaders,PRED,setting,ARG2,the tone)
32> I believe he did set the environment for such behaviours.
TRIPLET(ARG1,he,PRED,set,ARG2,the environment)
TRIPLET(ARG1,he,PRED,set,ARG2,the environment,for such behaviours)
33> It made me wonder if those employees who obtained information through questionable practices were monetarily rewarded?
TRIPLET(ARG1,me,PRED,wonder,ARG2,were)
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,made,ARG2,me)
TRIPLET(ARG1,me,PRED,wonder,ARG2,those employees)
34> Did the organisational system tacitly condition these unethical behaviours?
TRIPLET(ARG1,the organisational system,PRED,condition,ARG2,these unethical behaviours)
35> Now Murdoch has changed his ethos to ethically do-whatever-it-takes-to-win-attitude by implementing a Code of Ethics.
TRIPLET(ARG1,Murdoch,PRED,changed,ARG2,his ethos)
36> It made me wonder does Murdoch now 'walk the Code of Ethics talk' or is this considered lip service to keep the public satisfied?
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,made,ARG2,me)
37> During the lecture another question was asked of us 'Is Adolf Hitler an example of a good/effective leader'?
38> There was some debate about this, some felt he was and some felt he wasn't.
TRIPLET(ARG1,some debate,PRED,was,ARG2,some debate,about this)
39> I felt this was a really good example to help me understand what a good/effective leader is.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,felt,ARG2,this)
40> Yes Adolf Hitler achieved what he set out to do, but at what cost.
TRIPLET(ARG1,he,PRED,set,ARG2,do)
41> I applied this to an example at work.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,applied,ARG2,this)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,applied,ARG2,this,to an example)
42> I am a HR Business Partner and support clients.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,am,ARG2,a HR)
43> This generally means partnering with leaders to achieve business outcomes through employees.
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,means,ARG2,achieve)
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,means,ARG2,partnering)
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,achieve,ARG2,business outcomes)
44> I have a leader let's call him Joe Bloggs who is new to the business.
TRIPLET(ARG1,Joe Bloggs,PRED,is,ARG2,new,to the business)
45> He is still in the midst of setting up his corporate structure.
TRIPLET(ARG1,He,PRED,is,ARG2,still)
46> He's in here to do a job and the Regional Managing Director appointed him to do this job.
TRIPLET(ARG1,He,PRED,'s,ARG2,here)
TRIPLET(ARG1,the Regional Managing Director,PRED,appointed,ARG2,do)
TRIPLET(ARG1,the Regional Managing Director,PRED,appointed,ARG2,him)
TRIPLET(ARG1,him,PRED,do,ARG2,this job)
47> However I have learnt that he may be excelling his Key Performance Indicators by winning sales but he is damaging the corporate culture through his aggressive, insensitive, calculated and borderline bullying and discriminating behaviours which are impacting employee morale.
TRIPLET(ARG1,discriminating behaviours,PRED,impacting,ARG2,employee morale)
TRIPLET(ARG1,he,PRED,damaging,ARG2,the corporate culture)
TRIPLET(ARG1,he,PRED,excelling,ARG2,his Key Performance Indicators)
48> I'm not saying he is like Adolf Hitler, what I am saying is that it brought me another level of awareness, he was overachieving his sales targets but he was demonstrating questionable behaviour.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,brought,ARG2,me)
TRIPLET(ARG1,he,PRED,demonstrating,ARG2,questionable behaviour)
TRIPLET(ARG1,he,PRED,overachieving,ARG2,his sales targets)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,saying,ARG2,Adolf Hitler)
49> Does this make him an effective good leader?
TRIPLET(ARG1,this,PRED,make,ARG2,him)
50> In my opinion the answer was no.
51> I continued to contemplate how I was going to tactfully address this questionable behaviour.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,continued,ARG2,contemplate)
52> So what is driving leaders to act this way and make these types of questionable decisions?
TRIPLET(ARG1,leaders,PRED,act,ARG2,this way)
TRIPLET(ARG1,leaders,PRED,make,ARG2,these types,of questionable decisions)
53> My main assumption at this point was based on corporate structure, power and politics and lack of severe consequences when unethical behaviour is demonstrated.
54> I felt it was crucial for me to understand this so that I can better understand and be aware when I am making or supporting the making of decisions that may potentially be deemed unethical.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,was,ARG2,crucial)
TRIPLET(ARG1,for me,PRED,understand,ARG2,it)
TRIPLET(ARG1,for me,PRED,understand,ARG2,this)
TRIPLET(ARG1,for me,PRED,understand,ARG2,understand)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,making,ARG2,the making)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,supporting,ARG2,the making)
55> The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything Albert Einstein.
TRIPLET(ARG1,by those,PRED,watch,ARG2,them)
TRIPLET(ARG1,by those,PRED,do,ARG2,evil)
TRIPLET(ARG1,by those,PRED,destroyed,ARG2,The world)
56> This quote really resided with me.
57> It made me wake up to myself again.
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,made,ARG2,me)
58> I've been working in the corporate environment for almost eight years now and realized I am a product of being institutionalized - somewhat numb.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,am,ARG2,a product)
59> I personally felt that if I didn't participate in what I would consider as not such ethical behavioural then that separated me from being a part of that.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,felt,ARG2,consider)
TRIPLET(ARG1,that,PRED,separated,ARG2,me)
TRIPLET(ARG1,me,PRED,being,ARG2,a part)
TRIPLET(ARG1,that,PRED,separated,ARG2,from,being)
TRIPLET(ARG1,me,PRED,being,ARG2,a part,of that)
60> However Einstein highlights knowing without doing anything is how the world will be destroyed.
61> I applied this to my current work environment.
62> I have a level of accountability to ensure employees felt safe in their working environment, yes it's somewhat a legislative 'duty of care' requirement but for me it was more than that.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,was,ARG2,that)
TRIPLET(ARG1,of accountability,PRED,ensure,ARG2,employees)
63> For me personally it is about understanding that we live in a civilized society were we are to treat each other with respect and dignity not because it's the 'nice' thing to do but because it's the 'right' thing to do.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,'s,ARG2,do)
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,'s,ARG2,the ' nice ' thing)
64> So I made a decision to act ethically and not be a silent bystander at work.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,made,ARG2,a decision)
65> I took some accountability and approached the Regional Managing Director.
66> I provided a summary of events to him which contained examples of when Joe Bloggs was acting in an untoward way to employees and how it was affecting employee morale, team work and as a result hurting our customers and brand.
TRIPLET(ARG1,a result,PRED,hurting,ARG2,brand)
TRIPLET(ARG1,to him,PRED,contained,ARG2,examples)
TRIPLET(ARG1,a result,PRED,hurting,ARG2,our customers)
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,affecting,ARG2,team work)
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,affecting,ARG2,employee morale)
67> The Regional Managing Director facilitated a phone call immediately and had me participate in the discussion whereby Joe Bloggs was asked to explain himself and subsequently educated that despite Key Performance Indicator success this did not equal mistreating employees.
TRIPLET(ARG1,The Regional Managing Director,PRED,facilitated,ARG2,a phone call)
TRIPLET(ARG1,The Regional Managing Director,PRED,had,ARG2,a phone call)
TRIPLET(ARG1,this,PRED,did,ARG2,equal mistreating employees)
68> This matter was addressed as a conversation because the sad fact is no employees made a formal complaint about Joe Bloggs.
TRIPLET(ARG1,the sad fact,PRED,is,ARG2,no employees)
TRIPLET(ARG1,X,PRED,addressed,ARG2,This matter)
69> They stated that they feared losing their jobs or didn't want to create tension in the workplace.
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,feared,ARG2,losing)
TRIPLET(ARG1,They,PRED,want,ARG2,create)
TRIPLET(ARG1,They,PRED,create,ARG2,tension)
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,losing,ARG2,their jobs)
70> Previous to this example, I had other employees approach me about other matters and whether they should report it to the Ethics department.
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,report,ARG2,it)
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,report,ARG2,it,to the Ethics department)
71> But when it came to crunch time, they never did.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,crunch,ARG2,time)
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,came,ARG2,crunch)
72> They were always reluctant.
TRIPLET(ARG1,They,PRED,were,ARG2,always reluctant)
73> They were concerned that formally reporting this will jeopardize their career prospects, salary increase, bonuses etc despite the reassurance that it wouldn't.
TRIPLET(ARG1,X,PRED,concerned,ARG2,They)
TRIPLET(ARG1,reporting,PRED,jeopardize,ARG2,bonuses)
TRIPLET(ARG1,reporting,PRED,jeopardize,ARG2,salary increase)
TRIPLET(ARG1,reporting,PRED,jeopardize,ARG2,their career prospects)
74> It really made me wonder why is ok?
75> The reality is we have a lot more bystanders than those actually doing the evil.
76> Mid-subject reflections.
77> During one of the lectures I was first introduced to Values Based Management (VBM).
78> This was something new to me as I have not heard about it before.
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,was,ARG2,something)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,heard,ARG2,about it)
79> From what I can gather VBM is about managing for the long term by maximizing value, not profit.
80> I wondered are organizations that are aligned to VBM practices more successful than those that are not?
TRIPLET(ARG1,those,PRED,are,ARG2,not)
81> Once again I thought about my current workplace.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,thought,ARG2,about my current workplace)
82> Upon reflection I realized that my workplace does not adopt VBM practices.
TRIPLET(ARG1,my workplace,PRED,adopt,ARG2,VBM practices)
83> In fact the organisation is very short term in their thinking and reactive.
TRIPLET(ARG1,the organisation,PRED,is,ARG2,very)
TRIPLET(ARG1,the organisation,PRED,is,ARG2,short term)
84> Although we attempt at practicing good corporate citizenship behaviours we do not invest in our employees like other competitors would.
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,not invest,ARG2,in our employees)
85> Hence we have an attraction and retention issue.
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,have,ARG2,retention issue)
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,have,ARG2,an attraction)
86> The success factor at this organisation is purely based on numbers i.e. profit.
87> Sadly what this means is that if numbers aren't looking good each quarter cost cutting exercises are implemented.
TRIPLET(ARG1,numbers,PRED,looking,ARG2,good)
TRIPLET(ARG1,this means,PRED,is,ARG2,what)
88> This has impacted employee morale.
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,impacted,ARG2,employee morale)
89> It really made me wonder when will there be a shift in short term thinking to long term thinking.
90> Does this really exist or is it nirvana we are talking about?
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,talking,ARG2,nirvana)
91> During our tutorial we discussed the 'Strategies for Responsible Restructuring' paper.
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,discussed,ARG2,the ' Strategies)
92> This article really cemented that my current workplace considers 'employees as costs'.
TRIPLET(ARG1,my current workplace,PRED,considers,ARG2,employees)
TRIPLET(ARG1,my current workplace,PRED,considers,ARG2,employees,as costs)
93> It was such a positive refreshing paper to read about companies that do restructure responsibly.
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,was,ARG2,such)
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,read,ARG2,about companies)
94> It made me wonder why we don't ever hear about organizations that restructure responsibly.
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,ever hear,ARG2,about organizations)
95> I have registered myself to three or four different online HR newsletters and never have I read an article on responsible restructuring; it has always been about 'Company ABC expected to lay off 400 employees'.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,registered,ARG2,myself)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Company ABC,PRED,lay,ARG2,off 400 employees)
96> During our tutorial we conducted a role play exercise.
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,conducted,ARG2,a role play exercise)
97> This exercise was to role play Bill Quinn (Managing Director for King Gee) who was assigned by parent company Sara Lee to close down the Kempsey factory.
TRIPLET(ARG1,by parent,PRED,assigned,ARG2,who)
TRIPLET(ARG1,This exercise,PRED,was,ARG2,Managing Director,for King)
98> This resulted in impacting the Kempsey community and employees losing their jobs.
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,impacting,ARG2,employees)
TRIPLET(ARG1,the Kempsey community,PRED,losing,ARG2,their jobs)
TRIPLET(ARG1,employees,PRED,losing,ARG2,their jobs)
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,impacting,ARG2,the Kempsey community)
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,resulted,ARG2,in,impacting)
99> I volunteered myself to be the Head of HR in this role play.
100> I was supporting the student (Emily) role playing Bill Quinn.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,supporting,ARG2,the student)
101> We were outside going through our approach of how to deliver this awful news to employees.
TRIPLET(ARG1,We,PRED,were,ARG2,how)
102> We thought how would we prefer to hear this type of news, what will be the employees pain points, what things can do to ensure we address these pain points as much as possible, how can we deliver this information so it is clear but also personable etc.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,is,ARG2,clear)
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,hear,ARG2,type)
TRIPLET(ARG1,pain points,PRED,can,ARG2,we)
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,prefer,ARG2,hear,of news)
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,hear,ARG2,this type,of news)
103> It was a really difficult task and I could see Emily getting really nervous and sick to her stomach.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,see,ARG2,Emily)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Emily,PRED,getting,ARG2,to her stomach)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Emily,PRED,getting,ARG2,to her stomach)
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,was,ARG2,a really difficult task)
104> I started getting nervous and sick to my stomach.
105> From this exercise what I learnt most was not how it impacted employees but more so about the leaders role.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,impacted,ARG2,employees)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,learnt,ARG2,From this exercise)
106> It made me empathise with what leaders have to go through when they are delivering bad news.
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,delivering,ARG2,bad news)
107> It is a high pressured role with high expectations; leaders require strength, guts and accountability.
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,is,ARG2,a high pressured role)
108> After the exercise, Natalia informed us that Bill's mantra to deliver this news was to ensure that his employees were treated with dignity and respect.
TRIPLET(ARG1,Natalia,PRED,informed,ARG2,us)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Natalia,PRED,informed,ARG2,ensure)
TRIPLET(ARG1,Bill 's mantra,PRED,was,ARG2,ensure)
TRIPLET(ARG1,with dignity,PRED,treated,ARG2,his employees)
TRIPLET(ARG1,respect,PRED,treated,ARG2,his employees)
109> This resonated with me because in my early career in HR one of my senior colleagues taught me that exact same mantra and I pass on that same mantra to the leaders I work with, however sometimes it can be a struggle when I encounter leaders who are destructive.
TRIPLET(ARG1,leaders,PRED,are,ARG2,destructive)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,pass,ARG2,mantra)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,encounter,ARG2,leaders)
TRIPLET(ARG1,my senior colleagues,PRED,taught,ARG2,me)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,pass,ARG2,to the leaders I)
TRIPLET(ARG1,me,PRED,exact,ARG2,same mantra)
110> I attended the information session held by Natalia on the 24 April, there were two keynote speakers who talked about organisations that had strategic practices for sustainable outcomes.
TRIPLET(ARG1,speakers,PRED,talked,ARG2,about organisations)
TRIPLET(ARG1,about organisations,PRED,had,ARG2,strategic practices)
111> Two key highlights that I learnt from that information session were about leaders.
112> One aspect was Leadership was about the impact you have on others, this was a powerful statement to me, because most of the time when you read about leadership it talks about having followers and the influence you have over people to follow you.
TRIPLET(ARG1,you,PRED,read,ARG2,it)
TRIPLET(ARG1,One aspect,PRED,was,ARG2,Leadership)
TRIPLET(ARG1,you,PRED,read,ARG2,about leadership)
TRIPLET(ARG1,this,PRED,was,ARG2,a powerful statement,to me)
113> This statement however was powerful because it makes a leader accountable for their actions and the impact it has on people.
TRIPLET(ARG1,This statement,PRED,was,ARG2,powerful)
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,makes,ARG2,a leader)
114> It gelled with me rather well, that when I went back into the workplace I felt the desire to mention it to one of the Vice Presidents I support, hoping that by planting that seed one day I will get to see the benefits.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,get,ARG2,see)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,went,ARG2,into the workplace I)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,see,ARG2,the benefits)
115> The second aspect was based on the work that Nigel discussed about his work on coaching leaders to reach a level of mindfulness.
TRIPLET(ARG1,X,PRED,based,ARG2,The second aspect)
116> This was interesting work to me and hearing that places such as Google and Commbank were providing this support to Executives was comforting to hear.
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,interesting,ARG2,work)
TRIPLET(ARG1,places,PRED,providing,ARG2,this support)
117> Final reflections.
118> Upon finishing the subject, I honestly felt it was a worthwhile subject to do.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,was,ARG2,a worthwhile subject)
119> It wasn't just a subject that educates you on theories and case studies, it helped you understand you as a person and how you would make decisions if you were put into difficult situations.
TRIPLET(ARG1,you,PRED,make,ARG2,decisions)
TRIPLET(ARG1,a subject,PRED,educates,ARG2,you)
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,wasn't,ARG2,a subject)
120> I really enjoyed hearing about a case, then placed into the case and developing an action plan on how to manage that case.
TRIPLET(ARG1,hearing,PRED,placed,ARG2,hearing,about a case)
121> In particular I really enjoyed hearing about the pharmaceutical case study in our last tutorial.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,enjoyed,ARG2,hearing)
122> It was exciting to be given a scenario to think on your feet.
123> Reflecting back on the entire subject, I myself personally felt I would have liked to see myself contribute verbally more to the wider class.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,liked,ARG2,see)
124> I have no idea why I don't, but most of the times I prefer to sit quietly, listen, reflect and then contribute.
TRIPLET(ARG1,the times I,PRED,prefer,ARG2,sit)
125> I really respected the subject content as it felt authentic and that aligned to my personal values and how I operate as a human being.
TRIPLET(ARG1,it,PRED,felt,ARG2,authentic)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,operate,ARG2,as a human being)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,respected,ARG2,the subject content)
126> This led me to think about authentic leadership, you can't buy that, its genuine and you can't fake it.
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,led,ARG2,me)
TRIPLET(ARG1,you,PRED,fake,ARG2,it)
TRIPLET(ARG1,its genuine,PRED,fake,ARG2,it)
TRIPLET(ARG1,me,PRED,think,ARG2,about authentic leadership)
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,led,ARG2,think,about authentic leadership)
127> This was the type of leader I will be.
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,was,ARG2,the type,of leader I)
128> I reflected back to my workplace and we recently had a visit from the Executive Vice President of EMEA and APAC, I observed his behaviour in the town hall meeting.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,observed,ARG2,his behaviour)
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,had,ARG2,a visit,from the Executive Vice President)
129> I found him to be such an interesting and confident Executive Vice President, he wasn't like the other three leaders that I had observed before and the difference was authenticity.
TRIPLET(ARG1,the difference,PRED,was,ARG2,authenticity)
130> He didn't turn up to the meeting with PowerPoint slides to talk at the company's performance.
TRIPLET(ARG1,He,PRED,turn,ARG2,to the meeting,with PowerPoint slides)

142> This article identifies that there is a problem 'focus too much on maximizing short term results'.
TRIPLET(ARG1,that,PRED,is,ARG2,a problem)
143> This was such a refreshing article to read, because to be honest I was a little cynical that these types of organisations did exist.
TRIPLET(ARG1,be,PRED,was,ARG2,a little cynical)
TRIPLET(ARG1,This,PRED,was,ARG2,such a refreshing article)
144> When I talked to Vice Presidents and Directors in company I asked casually asked them why we exist and without a doubt most of them responded with to make money for the shareholders.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,talked,ARG2,Directors)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,talked,ARG2,to Vice Presidents)

TRIPLET(ARG1,My,PRED,retrieve,ARG2,faulty equipment)
157> I had been doing this for about three days and had been following all the safety procedures, for example abiding by lab rules, wearing correct footwear, tying my hair back and wearing my electrostatic discharge (ESD) strap whenever handling open equipment.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,been,ARG2,this)
158> I expected that because I was following these rules I was executing my role in a way that followed all the safety policies.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,was,ARG2,following these rules I)
TRIPLET(ARG1,a way,PRED,followed,ARG2,all the safety policies)
159> However it was not until the end of my first week where I was told to do the ESD training which required me to watch a set of videos and complete a small exam about the risks of electrostatic discharge on equipment.

TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,worked,ARG2,the equipment)
161> I initially thought that doing what I was told, wearing the ESD strap when handling open equipment, was all I needed to do to keep myself safe.
TRIPLET(ARG1,open equipment,PRED,was,ARG2,all I)
162> As a result, when I felt ‘safe' around a harmless circuit board, I would sometimes neglect the strap as I didn't see it as a threat to my safety.

TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,neglect,ARG2,the strap)

163> I was not told that the ESD strap was indeed to protect the electrical components of the machine and was not entirely for my safety.
TRIPLET(ARG1,the ESD strap,PRED,was,ARG2,indeed)
164> I understand that I was told to wear the strap whenever handling open equipment, however I believe it was my supervisor's responsibility to emphasise why, or to introduce me to the training before I began work on the equipment.

TRIPLET(ARG1,the strap,PRED,do,ARG2,what)
168> As a result I could have potentially been harming equipment without realising.
169> Once I conducted the ESD training I realised it was not for my safety, but rather for the safety of the electrical components.
TRIPLET(ARG1,the ESD,PRED,training,ARG2,I)
170> As a result I felt very unprofessional and although my behaviour did not do any immediate harm to the equipment, I still felt guilty that I had not taken the necessary precautions or taken any interest in understanding why I was wearing the strap.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,felt,ARG2,guilty)
TRIPLET(ARG1,my behaviour,PRED,do,ARG2,any immediate harm)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,wearing,ARG2,the strap)

TRIPLET(ARG1,My role,PRED,was,ARG2,answer)
TRIPLET(ARG1,My,PRED,answer,ARG2,requests,for engineers)
179> I expected that I was only responsible for the tasks that I had been trained in however what actually happened was the queue of requests in this online reporting system was far too large, most of the requests I had not been trained how to handle and so the situation got out of hand, I had to send some requests to other members of the team so they could take care of them.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,send,ARG2,take)
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,take,ARG2,care)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,send,ARG2,some requests)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,was,ARG2,only responsible,for the tasks)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,send,ARG2,some requests,to other members)
180> As a result the team was juggling too many tasks on top of their own, some engineers called in to complain that their high priority requests were taking too long to complete.
TRIPLET(ARG1,the team,PRED,juggling,ARG2,many tasks)
181> The main reason this situation got so out of hand was because half the team was on training and I was the sole person responsible for answering the engineers’ online requests.
TRIPLET(ARG1,half the team,PRED,was,ARG2,on training)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,was,ARG2,the sole person)
182> The situation would definitely have been worse if I did not have the other team members to help me, however it would have been easily resolved if I was capable of solving all the online requests by myself because then I would be carrying an equal responsibility, rather than putting more work on others.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,was,ARG2,capable)

TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,carrying,ARG2,an equal responsibility)

TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,do,ARG2,nothing)
TRIPLET(ARG1,more I,PRED,been,ARG2,more help)
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,handled,ARG2,the tasks)
184> In the end I felt quite useless and frustrated that my knowledge after almost three weeks in the role was indeed limited.
185> Personally I believe I performed well in the things I felt qualified to do, but as for those that I had not been trained in, I felt that I handled the situation very poorly by giving the work to others in my team.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,handled,ARG2,the situation)
186> I learnt that a team can only truly be efficient if each member bears the responsibility of their role, if this responsibility is equal to that of others and if they have the capacity to handle the consequences of their actions.

TRIPLET(ARG1,each member,PRED,bears,ARG2,the responsibility)
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,have,ARG2,the capacity)

187> I feel that I did this very poorly and thus impacted the team and as a result, on this occasion, we were very inefficient.
TRIPLET(ARG1,we,PRED,were,ARG2,very inefficient)
188> The way individuals take responsibility for their roles does not only apply to team situations.
TRIPLET(ARG1,The way individuals,PRED,take,ARG2,responsibility,for their roles)

TRIPLET(ARG1,X,PRED,required,ARG2,be)
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,be,ARG2,accountable)
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,is,ARG2,fundamental)
190> A situation such as ethical decision making or a safety issue while repairing a machine on the job for example is a very common situation where an engineer must be able to hold the responsibility of her role and act accordingly.
TRIPLET(ARG1,an engineer,PRED,hold,ARG2,the responsibility)
191> It is no use throwing the burden on somebody else because this engineer is entirely responsible for their job and their client while on site.
TRIPLET(ARG1,It,PRED,throwing,ARG2,the burden,on somebody)
TRIPLET(ARG1,this engineer,PRED,is,ARG2,entirely responsible,for their job)
192> Another situation where the efficiency of an individual is highly important in this regard is when an engineer may need to manage a team, rather than being a member in the team.
TRIPLET(ARG1,an engineer,PRED,need,ARG2,manage)
TRIPLET(ARG1,the efficiency,PRED,is,ARG2,highly important)
TRIPLET(ARG1,an engineer,PRED,manage,ARG2,a team)
193> As part of their role, they have responsibility for each member and must be able to handle the consequences of their actions and the actions of the members in their team.
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,have,ARG2,responsibility,for each member)
194> As a result the lesson that I learnt about being accountable for actions can be applied to any individual situation where decision making is required, or to situations where an engineer must be able to manage others.
TRIPLET(ARG1,an engineer,PRED,manage,ARG2,others)
195> I discussed my concerns with my mentor after the event took place and she emphasised the importance of collaboration in a team before an individual should be expected to hold responsibility.
TRIPLET(ARG1,the importance,PRED,hold,ARG2,responsibility)
196> My mentor was able to redirect my thinking and stated that the reason I was unable to handle my responsibility in my role was because I had not previously taken advantage of the team and learnt how they dealt with the tasks I had been given.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,taken,ARG2,advantage)
TRIPLET(ARG1,the reason I,PRED,was,ARG2,unable)
TRIPLET(ARG1,they,PRED,dealt,ARG2,with the tasks I)
TRIPLET(ARG1,My mentor,PRED,redirect,ARG2,my thinking)
197> In order to understand how to handle responsibility I must first be confident in my role and in order to do this I have to learn off my team members and be trained in my tasks before being assigned such responsibility.
TRIPLET(ARG1,handle,PRED,be,ARG2,confident)
198> In order to do this I have utilise the method of collaborative learning before I can accept to be assigned a high degree of individual responsibility.
TRIPLET(ARG1,I,PRED,accept,ARG2,assigned)
199> The main concern I had in this situation was that when I realised I was unable to complete my task, as I had not received training in it, I simply gave it to someone else.

201> From previous experiences this approach has always worked as I have been eager to learn.
