9> ABSTRACT.
10> Understanding students' learning dispositions has been a focus for research in education for many years.
11> A range of alternative approaches to conceptualising and measuring this broad construct have been developed.
12> Traditional psychometric measures aim to produce scales that satisfy the requirements for research; however, such measures have an additional use - to provide formative feedback to the learner.
13> In this article we reanalyse 15 years of data derived from the Effective Lifelong Learning Inventory.

21> Introduction.
22> The concept of learning power and its assessment tool, the Effective Lifelong Learning Inventory (ELLI), was developed in the late 1990s.
23> It was the outcome of research that tested constructs suggested within the literature of the time as having some relevance for the establishment of dispositions, attitudes and values associated with being an effective learner.
24> The result was both a measurement model and a set of research-validated strategies.
25> Both have proven to be of value for education, business and corporate organisations seeking to innovate in how they support individual and collaborative learning.
26> In contrast to the skill-based approach that became popular during the same period, the concern with learning power was to develop a range of competences crucial for success in the complex, networked, information-rich and radically uncertain world of the emerging twenty-first century.

49> The factor analytic studies identified seven latent variables and established scales to measure them (Deakin Crick et al., 2004RIDCIT0039).
50> These variables were described as 'qualities necessary for learning', and they informed the first iteration of the ELLI self-assessment instrument - changing and learning:
51> growth orientation, meaning making, critical curiosity, resilience, creativity, learning relationships and strategic awareness (2004, p. 259).
52> One criticism of the set of scales (unpublished) was in the reported degree of shared variance between these scales and thus their construct validity.
53> For academic research use this was undesirable but in a measurement model designed to reflect back to students what they said about themselves as learners - and whole people - it was more authentic and thus fit for purpose.

54> The second part of the research was addressed by a qualitative phase in which three schools, 12 teachers and a total of 380 students, selected from the original study, were provided with data for each individual student and mean scores for each group, from the ELLI questionnaire.
55> Teachers were invited to use these data in learning design in their regular teaching during the following year.
56> Classroom practices, in which both teachers and students participated, were studied during the year, including the teachers as 'co-researchers'.
57> The following pedagogical themes were identified as significant:
58> (i) teacher commitment to learner-centred values and willingness to make pedagogical judgements; (ii) positive interpersonal relationships characterised by trust, affirmation and challenge; (iii) development of a language for learning particularly using metaphor and image; (iv) modelling by teachers of learning power and imitation of teachers' or other 'experts'' behaviour by students; (v) active learning dialogue; (vi) personal and collaborative reflection on learning power; (vii) the development of learner self-awareness and ownership of their own learning power; (viii) student choice and responsibility for learning decisions and (ix) re-sequencing of the content of the curriculum to support enquiry-based learning.
59> These themes were supported by a range of strategies and skills for developing learning power, either drawn from National guidance or organically developed by the schools themselves (Deakin Crick, 2007RIDCIT0030).
60> ELLI assessment data included aspects of a person's learning that were both 'internal' and 'social' - influenced by a person's sense of 'self' in a sociocultural and historical context.
61> Feedback was in the form of an immediate visual image of an individual's learning 'profile' as a spider diagram.
62> This provided a framework for a coaching conversation which moved between the coachee's identity as a learner and his or her learning experiences and purposes.
63> The ELLI instrument was designed to identify and strengthen an individual's learning dispositions, attitudes and values and provide a starting point for self-directed learning and teacher-facilitated pedagogical change.
64> The coaching conversation created 'space' for individuals to identify their unique sense of identity as a learner and to begin to 'own' and formulate a particular purpose or desired outcome.
65> With skilled pedagogical interventions, these conversations formed a starting point for the individual to determine what they wanted to achieve in a learning context (why) and how they would go about achieving that purpose (how).
66> The responsibility for the processes of learning shifted from the teacher to the learner.
67> The second phase of the original research created significant practitioner interest as well as commercial interest in the instrument.

71> Ongoing research explored learning and teaching facilitation strategies which enable individuals to become responsible, self-aware learners by responding to their learning power profiles.
72> For example the Learning Futures mixed methods case study (Deakin Crick et al., 2010bRIDCIT0047; Deakin Crick et al., 2011RIDCIT0049) explored the relationships between teacher facilitation of enquiry-based learning and the development of learning power and from a stratified sample of students with 'low, medium and high' levels of reported learning power undertook a narrative study of student learning identities (Deakin Crick and Goldspink, 2014RIDCIT0041).
73> The relationship between the sequencing of the curriculum and the development of learning power in enquiry-based learning was explored in qualitative studies, the context of learning with disengaged and gifted and talented students in action enquiries (Deakin Crick, 2009aRIDCIT0031), in a mixed methods evaluation of postgraduate teaching on sustainable systems in engineering (Godfrey et al., 2014RIDCIT0064) and theoretically (Deakin Crick, 2009bRIDCIT0032; Jaros and Deakin Crick, 2007RIDCIT0082).
74> Qualitative studies undertaken in Australia with indigenous communities enabled a deeper qualitative and narrative exploration of the ubiquitous use of metaphor, narrative and image - visual literacy - in the development of learning power (Deakin Crick and Grushka, 2009RIDCIT0042; Goodson and Deakin Crick, 2009RIDCIT0068; Grushka, 2009RIDCIT0069).
75> An explorative quantitative study reported on the ecology of learner-centred variables in complex classroom contexts which interact with learning power (Deakin Crick et al., 2007aRIDCIT0048).
76> Huang's (2014RIDCIT0076) mixed methods case study explored the contribution of learning power to authentic pedagogy and its role in classrooms as complex adaptive systems.
77> Coaching for learning emerged as a key strategy for change in a person's learning identity in two mixed methods studies (Aberdeen, 2014RIDCIT0001; Ren, 2010RIDCIT0104; Wang, 2013RIDCIT0134) explored the relationship between a teacher's own self-reflection on his or her learning power and its impact on his or her practice.

78> Two major quantitative reliability and validity studies were conducted to test the original scales on data that were collected through research and practitioner use of the instrument.
79> This enabled the development of an adult version of the instrument (Deakin Crick et al., 2013RIDCIT0044; Deakin Crick and Yu, 2008RIDCIT0052) and demonstrated the stability of the scales across domains and cultures, enjoying considerable face validity with school-age students and adult learners and corresponding acceptance with both populations.
80> These studies also demonstrated that reported learning power drops significantly as children get older and increases as adults mature.
81> Distinctive patterns of learning power profiles were demonstrated in underachieving students (Ren, 2010RIDCIT0104; Ren and Deakin Crick, 2013RIDCIT0104), in young people with prosocial values (Arthur et al., 2006RIDCIT0004) and antisocial values (Deakin Crick et al., 2014RIDCIT0036).
82> Demand for access to ELLI from users was such that it has been translated into German, Italian, Chinese, Arabic and Malay.
83> It has again enjoyed face validity in those contexts although full re-validation tests have not yet been conducted (Deakin Crick and Ren, 2011RIDCIT0049; Ren and Deakin Crick, 2012RIDCIT0103).
84> It has been applied to schools, to work-based learning, piloted with a major UK retailer; a bank and in the financial services industry (Deakin Crick et al., 2013RIDCIT0044; Deakin Crick and Davies, 2014RIDCIT0040); Indigenous Australian communities (Willis, 2014RIDCIT0136); the education of young offenders (Deakin Crick et al., 2014RIDCIT0036; Deakin Crick and Salway, 2006RIDCIT0050); leadership studies (Ritchie and Deakin Crick, 2007RIDCIT0105); engineering education (Godfrey et al., 2014RIDCIT0064) and teaching in higher education (Harding and Thompson, 2011RIDCIT0070; Small and Deakin Crick, 2008RIDCIT0118).
85> Reflection on this evidence, and on practitioner experience accumulated over this period of time (Deakin Crick, 2006RIDCIT0029) (which is generally not reported in academic contexts), supported and extended the original qualitative findings from phase 2 of the original research study, particularly by focusing on coaching relationships, enquiry-based learning and authentic pedagogy, as pedagogical practices which encourage individuals to take responsibility for their own learning.
86> In our view the value of the instrument was in providing a specific measurement model, a conceptual framework, a language with which to describe a complex 'messy' human process and an assessment technology that permitted the use of research data for stimulating self-directed change.
87> It thus provided specificity, assess-ability and rigour to the conceptually and empirically complex social processes implicated in effective learning.
88> The same data points were useful for practice as well as for organisational improvement research and for more fundamental university-led research - thus organically promoting a networked improvement community whenever it was used in this way.

101> In making available both research and immediate, visual, diagnostic information for self-directed change, ELLI provided an early example of a learning analytic tool (Buckingham Shum and Deakin Crick, 2012RIDCIT0020).
102> Learning analytics is an emerging practical field of study which refers to the ways in which computational support for capturing digital data can help to inform decision making for the processes and outcomes of learning (Buckingham Shum, 2012RIDCIT0019).
103> Key to this is the rapid feedback of data to users at all levels of the system and the capability of technology to re-present complex data visually.
104> ELLI represented an early example of an online learning analytic platform, which provided data useful for feedback at four levels (individuals, teams, organisations and system).
105> The level of demand it enjoyed has enabled the accumulation of a large data set which has been collated and archived at the University of Bristol.
106> A 3-year research programme for mining and exploring this secondary data set has now been established.

118> The developing hypotheses were developed in an international research community that had extensive experience in working with ELLI over time and in different cultural contexts (see, e.g., www.learningemergence.net) theoretically, empirically and practically.
119> The comparison of ELLI data with data from the Teaching for Effective Learning Project in South Australia, for example, led to our understanding that learning identity and openness to learning were critical prerequisites for learning (Deakin Crick and Goldspink, 2014RIDCIT0041; Deakin Crick et al., 2013RIDCIT0044; Goldspink and Foster, 2013RIDCIT0066).
120> An early unpublished study in prisons gave cause for concern about the concept of resilience as represented in the original ELLI structure (Deakin Crick and Salway, 2006RIDCIT0050) with an emerging hypothesis that to become resilient a person needed to utilise all the learning power dimensions over time.

136> This complexity is not only 'intra-personal' and 'inter-personal' but also social and organisational - that is, it is significantly influenced by the social organisations, cultural practices and world views of the learning contexts in which learners find themselves (Deakin Crick et al., 2011RIDCIT0046; Ren, 2010RIDCIT0102; Ren and Deakin Crick, 2013RIDCIT0104; Tracy, 2014RIDCIT0126).
137> This realisation led us to develop a conceptual framework of learning as a complex process, whose boundaries are defined by a purpose, and which operates recursively at different layers and levels in social organisations which are themselves characterised by socio-technical and political complexity (Buckingham Shum and Deakin Crick, 2012RIDCIT0020; Buckingham Shum and Ferguson, 2011RIDCIT0021; Deakin Crick et al., 2014RIDCIT0036; Ferguson and Buckingham Shum, 2011RIDCIT0059; Ullmann et al., 2011RIDCIT0128).
138> Drawing on work in systems designing from engineering (Blockley, 2010RIDCIT0012; Blockley and Godfrey, 2000RIDCIT0013), we developed a complex systems architecture for learning journeys which valorises the identification of a personally chosen purpose, that is integrated and internalised by the learner as a prerequisite for meaningful learning.
139> A complex systems architecture is a conceptual framework that sets out the key parts of a system, what they do and how they fit and work together.
140> Thinking about learning as a complex system allows us to theorise and test a holistic understanding of learning:.
141> A system is a group of parts that interact so that the system as a whole can do things the parts can't do on their own.
142> This property of systems is called emergence - the whole is more than the sum of its parts.
143> A system can include people, organisations, technology, information, processes, services, and nature.

176> In practice, the entry point for understanding or intervention in a learning process could be at any point in the process and could be influenced by a number of external systems.
177> These are inherently difficult to predict - since the orders of emergence in human social systems are exponentially complex compared to orders of emergence in natural systems (Goldspink and Kay, 2009RIDCIT0067).
178> This is why teaching and learning is not successful when stakeholders are simply 'following a script' and why successful teaching is more like a design process in which teachers respond and adapt in context to the needs of learners as they emerge (Furlong et al., 2000RIDCIT0063).
179> This model presents learning as a sequential process with iterative feedback loops that operate through the relationships between self, others and the environment.
180> It begins with the person who is learning and his or her sense of purpose or desire.
181> This provides the energy to engage in learning as a journey that takes place in a particular context, over time.
182> A person is influenced by his or her perceptions of context as well as by his or her own processes of learning (Huang, 2014RIDCIT0076).
183> Teachers or learning facilitators can have a direct influence on the context of learning; they can scaffold the processes of knowledge structuring and increasing awareness of learning power, whilst agency cannot be imposed or conferred by other people.
184> Rather, it is an emergent property of the recursive interactions between self and context.

232> The Measures.
233> The ELLI was a self-report questionnaire in which respondents indicated their approach to various aspects of learning through completion of an online 4-point Likert-type questionnaire (Likert, 1932RIDCIT0089).
234> The items in the questionnaire elicited information about what the individual thinks, feels and tends to do in relation to everyday learning situations.
235> The respondents' judgements in responding to the items were based on their own experiences, past and present, including the context in which they found themselves at the time they completed the questionnaire.
236> The scales for the seven dimensions of learning power were calculated online and used to produce feedback for the individual characterising his or her perception of his or her own learning power on these dimensions in the form of a spider diagram shown in Figure 2.
237> The scores were produced as a percentage of the total possible score for that dimension.
238> Figure 2.

277> This is renamed 'mindful agency' in the revised instrument as a result of the analysis and redesign of the scales as discussed later.
278> The exploratory factor analysis of the items associated with the strategic awareness latent variable returned three factors which we have called:
279> (i) managing the processes of learning, (ii) managing the feelings associated with challenge and (iii) agency in taking responsibility for learning purposes, processes and procedures.
280> These items were used to construct the Structural Equation Model shown in Figure 3.
281> Figure 3.
282> Mindful agency SEM model.
283> This suggests a tripartite structure for mindful agency, which is about the self as agent of his or her own learning, able to take responsibility for the process, as well as managing feelings in learning (such as feeling confused) and being able to judge how long something may take and how to go about it (meta-cognitive strategy).
284> This serves to integrate three distinct strands in the research literature:
285> meta-cognition, the role of affect in self-regulation (emotional intelligence) and self-efficacy or agency, as will be discussed further later in text.
286> The model is in good fit (RMSEA = 0.031; CFI = 0.984) and demonstrates that mindful agency accounts for 81% of the variance in agency, 72% of the variance in managing feelings and 85% of the variance in managing processes of learning.
287> The resulting scale returned an alpha reliability coefficient of 0.78 with nine items presented in Table 5.

301> Bown (2009RIDCIT0017, p. 578) states for example that self-regulative learners are those who are aware of themselves as active agents who are then able to exercise that agency through various strategies to actively shape and construct their learning experiences as well as their motivational and affective responses.
302> Similarly Mercer, drawing on a detailed longitudinal study of a particular learner, observed that '…three components of Joana's agentic system appear to play a more significant role…in directing the trajectory of her agency:
303> motivation, affect and self-regulation (including goals, meta-cognitive knowledge, and strategic knowledge)' (2011, pp. 432-433).
304> Of the three constructs, agency is likely to be the most problematic.
305> This concept gets caught on the horns of the 'free-will versus determinacy' dilemma which, even in its more moderate form, leads to argumentation about how the independent will of individuals sits alongside the constraints resulting from the wider social context.
306> Nevertheless it frequently appears within the educational literature (Etalapelto et al., 2013RIDCIT0058).
307> It refers to the implicit or explicit (Moore et al., 2012RIDCIT0097) sense of initiating and controlling events - the will and capacity to act and to influence others or the environment.
308> This is in contrast to the adoption of a sense of having no control over one's own destiny and taking a passive or reactive stance to events and others.
309> This presupposes a sense of self-efficacy and hence links to the extensive education-related literature on that subject (Bandura, 1982RIDCIT0005, 1986RIDCIT0006, 1994aRIDCIT0007; Schunk, 1987RIDCIT0113; Zimmerman et al., 1992RIDCIT0138).
310> The role that managing feelings plays in relation to learner effectiveness is also well addressed in the literature, most notably with regard to the concept of emotional intelligence.
311> This literature addresses the different capacities individuals have to regulate their own emotions and/or to detect and influence those of others upon whom attainment of their goal depends.
312> Emotional intelligence has been shown in some studies to predict academic achievement across a wide range of age groups (see, e.g., Billings et al., 2014RIDCIT0010; Mohzan et al., 2013RIDCIT0096; Sanchez-Ruiz et al., 2013RIDCIT0110).

314> Perhaps most importantly, following Fredrickson et al. (Fredrickson, 2001RIDCIT0060; Fredrickson and Joiner, 2002RIDCIT0061; Fredrickson and Losada, 2005RIDCIT0062), emotions may have the implication of disposing someone to be open to new learning - to approach the unknown - or closed to it.
315> Positive emotions have been shown to 'broaden peoples' momentary thought-action repertoires and build their enduring personal resources' (Fredrickson, 2001RIDCIT0060, p. 222).
316> Finally, it is again uncontroversial to argue that individuals differ in their ability to exercise judgement about how effective they are being in their chosen approach to learning (meta-cognitive monitoring) and/or to exercise effective control over their choice of learning strategies (meta-cognitive control).
317> Again there is a substantial literature (Andrade, 1999RIDCIT0003; Blakey and Spence, 1990RIDCIT0011; Coutinho and Neuman, 2008RIDCIT0022; Dunlosky and Metcalfe, 2009RIDCIT0054; Kitchener, 1983RIDCIT0087, Veenman et al., 2006RIDCIT0131, Vrugt and Oort, 2008RIDCIT0132) that deals with these from the perspective of heuristics linked to specific disciplines through to the underlying neuroscience.

318> However, Efklides (2006RIDCIT0057) argues that meta-cognitive experience - especially feelings - guide subsequent choices about strategy.
319> As well as feelings of familiarity, difficulty, knowing, confidence and satisfaction, these experiences include judgements about how much effort will be required to learn something and how much time it may take (aligning directly with the items included in the 'managing process' construct).
320> These meta-cognitive feelings and judgments '…are products of nonanalytic, nonconscious inferential processes particularly when there are conditions that do not allow full analysis of the situation such as…under conditions of uncertainty' (Efklides, 2006RIDCIT0057, p. 5).
321> The feelings respond to the gestalt of presenting circumstances, including the task difficulty, the context including whether it is perceived as positive or negative, one's self-concept and affective factors such as mood.
322> Efklides concludes that metacognitive experience monitors '…the progress being made towards ones goal and they convey this information in an affective or cognitive manner…guiding the self-regulatory process in both the short and long run' (Efklides, 2006RIDCIT0057, p. 7).
323> A great deal of the assessment of the contextual support for learning implied in the model in Figure 3 may therefore be by way of affective pre-appraisal and the attendant meta-cognitive judgements.
324> Importantly these may influence (i) the learner's willingness to enter into and engage with the context at all, (ii) the choices they make about how to engage and finally (iii) if and how they join with others in the process.
325> Work by Iiskala and Lehtinen (2004RIDCIT0079), for instance, suggests that people co-regulate their learning on the meta-cognitive experience cues of those with whom they are collaborating.
326> This research then has re-identified empirical support for these well-established dispositions and capabilities associated with effective learning.
327> All three sub-dimensions of mindful agency can be shown to connect the learners to their context, including their relational and social/emotional characteristics, and this serves to validate the interdependence found in the empirical evidence.
328> How then does this construct relate to the other active learning power dimensions?
329> The factor analysis (both exploratory and confirmatory) suggested four additional learning power dimensions closely associated with mindful agency.
330> This is consistent with the ELLI, but following the reanalysis and the re-specification of scales, these are renamed creativity; sense-making; hope and optimism; and curiosity.
331> Creativity.
332> The exploratory factor analysis of the creativity items returned two factors:
333> (i) imagination and intuition and (ii) risk-taking and playfulness.
334> The final scale of creativity returned an alpha reliability coefficient of 0.80 with the eight items presented in Table 6.
335> TABLE 6:
336> Creativity scale.
337> Sometimes good ideas just come into my head Imagination and intuition.
338> I tend to use my imagination to help me learn.
339> Sometimes if I stop and wait good ideas just arrive in my head.
340> Often it is when I let my mind 'float free' that my best ideas come to me.
341> I like to try out new ways of doing things even if there is very little time Risk-taking & playfulness.
342> I enjoy trying out new ways of learning.
343> When my learning gets tedious I am good at finding ways to make it interesting.
344> I feel it's alright to experiment with new ways of learning.
345> These latent variables in the creativity scale are consistent with the literature on creativity.
346> Hennessy and Amabile's (2010) review concluded that in spite of the array of disciplinary approaches to understanding creativity, what is required now are all-encompassing systems theories of creativity designed to tie together and make sense of the diversity of perspectives, from the 'innermost neurological level to the outermost cultural level' (p. 590).
347> Although creativity has some trait-like stable characteristics, it is also a state subject to influence by the social environment, and people are most creative when they are intrinsically motivated.
348> Kim (2006RIDCIT0085) suggests that reflective abstraction is the mechanism for creativity and also that creativity and imagination are interrelated.
349> Vygotsky went further and argued that imagination serves as an imperative impetus of all human creative activity and that its operation is a 'function essential to life' (1930/2004, p. 13).
350> He also suggested that, developmentally, imagination is a successor of children's play (Vygotsky, 1930/2004RIDCIT0133, p. 77).
351> There is also substantial support in the literature for playfulness as a creative activity and process (Hennessey and Amabile, 1987RIDCIT0074; Saracho, 2002RIDCIT0111) which is a way of exploring ideas and testing alternative pathways for problem-solving (Tsai, 2012RIDCIT0127).

403> Hope and Optimism.
404> The hope and optimism scale is named more accurately to link with the extant literature.
405> Snyder (2000RIDCIT0120) defines hope as a motivational construct that initiates and sustains progress towards a goal.
406> It is a control belief, the perception that one can strategise different routes required to progress towards a goal (Snyder et al., 1991RIDCIT0121, 2002RIDCIT0122).
407> There is an agency component to hope - the perception that one has the ability and the energy successfully to navigate a chosen pathway to achieving a goal.
408> Hope is predictive of student achievement at all educational levels (Curry et al., 1999RIDCIT0025) and adults with hope have higher coping mechanisms and problem-solving capabilities.
409> It predicts better study skills (Onwuegbuzie and Snyder, 2000RIDCIT0101).
410> Hope is closely related to optimism - a control belief involving positive thinking and a positive attitude to life events (Scheier and Carver, 1985RIDCIT0112; Seligman, 1991RIDCIT0114) and also to self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986RIDCIT0006) - a competence belief about one's capability to execute a particular action and achieve a particular goal.

458> Rather, a low score on dependence and fragility is better understood as an emotional and cognitive 'closedness' to the inter- and intra-personal dynamics of learning power as a defence against external 'threats', and this indicates a barrier to deep learning.
459> A high score, indicating dependence and fragility, is also not desirable in terms of learning power, since it leads to loss of subjectivity (Morin, 2008RIDCIT0098) and therefore agency, due to the failure of a healthy and productive operational closure (Goldspink and Kay, 2009RIDCIT0067).
460> The study suggested that this quality of being either 'closed' or 'dependent' in learning is context-dependent and can only be appropriately interpreted in the light of the relational context of the learner (i.e. it may be adaptive or maladaptive from the perspective of the learner, depending on the context).
461> For the current study we conducted an exploratory factor analysis on all of the items measuring dependence and fragility identified two latent variables:

475> I am happier learning when I have clear instructions.
476> This model suggests that this scale should be treated differently from the other scales since either extreme is undesirable for learning.
477> To be (i) closed or to be (ii) dependent on the other suggests that (i) the other is not available for relationship in learning or (ii) the self is not available for relationship in learning.
478> Both reactions in effect close the flow between the learner-self and the others, though in very different ways.
479> What this scale measures is an emergent state of the self-ego relational processes.
480> A desirable measure would be a midpoint, for optimal learning, although in some contexts of risk a measure nearer to either extreme may be found more appropriate.

487> Similarly, psychological safety, defined as 'a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking', facilitates 'learning behavior in work teams because it alleviates excessive concern about others' reactions to actions that have the potential for embarrassment or threat, which learning behaviors often have' (Edmondson, 1999RIDCIT0056, p. 354).
488> Edmondson (1999RIDCIT0056) also points out that 'engaging in learning behavior in a team is highly dependent on team psychological safety by suggesting that team members' confidence that they will not be punished for a well-intentioned interpersonal risk enables learning behavior in a way that team efficacy, or confidence that the team is capable of doing its work, does not' (p. 376).

514> The initial testing of our practical and experiential theory about learning power through structural equation modelling confirmed our hypothesis that there were three orthogonal dimensions or dimension sets within the overall construct of learning power:
515> (i) learning relationships, (ii) fragility and dependence and (iii) the set of 'active' learning power dimensions:
516> strategic awareness, creativity, critical curiosity, meaning making and changing and learning.
517> Learning relationships was the most complex, whilst fragility and dependence, although mildly negatively correlated with all of the active learning power dimensions, were not their direct opposite, and this was discussed in detail in our previous paper (Deakin Crick et al., under review).

518> Our hypothesis was that the fragility and dependence scale was picking up a visceral, emotionally based disposition about a person's state of openness or closedness to the unknown, to risk taking, ambiguity and uncertainty, in contrast to the more volitional and cognitive constitution of the remaining five active dimensions, of which strategic awareness was the most significant.
519> We then explored the internal structure of each of these three orthogonal dimensions, beginning with the set of active learning power scales.
520> We did this by using an exploratory factor analysis on each scale with a randomised half of the data set and followed it with a confirmatory factor analysis, through building a structural equation model with the other half.
521> This demonstrated that the scale of strategic awareness comprised of three latent variables, one of which was to do with the management of feelings, the second was to do with managing of the processes of learning and the third was about a sense of agency in learning.
522> We demonstrated two latent variables in creativity ('imagination and intuition' and 'risk taking and playfulness') and two in meaning making ('making connections' and learning 'mattering emotionally to the learner').
523> We theorised that strategic awareness was a 'second-order' type of dimension developed through language, dialogue and relationship, and so we chose to develop a structural equation model to explore the relationship between strategic awareness and the remaining 'active' learning power dimensions.
524> Learning relationships were constituted by three latent variables ('dependency', 'collaboration' and 'belonging') which were evidently contextually sensitive.
525> Of these three, the 'dependency' variable correlated with fragility and dependence.
526> The fragility and dependence scale contained two latent variables (i) 'submissive mindset' and (ii) 'dependence'.
527> Finally, we reconstructed a structural equation model of the whole set of scales to test our emerging hypothesis about the internal structure of learning power and to present a completely new instrument which is more parsimonious (72 items in the original version reduced to 49 in the revised) but balances the competing requirements of practical utility with statistical rigour.

534> First, the overall model produced demonstrates a good fit with strong effect sizes, which provides a solid foundation for conceptual and theoretical development.
535> Each of the scales has been improved by a reduction in the number of items whilst maintaining internal consistency.
536> The whole questionnaire is now 49 items, considerably less than the previous 72.
537> Of these 49 items only 32 were drawn from the original instrument - the others were devised during the ongoing effort of research and development between 2003 and 2013.
538> The experience of the team in working with the scales in both theory and practice facilitated the iteration between the theorisation and testing necessary for exploration using structural equation modelling.
539> The reliability of the model was tested systematically through the randomised splitting of the data set.
540> In practical terms this has enabled much greater discrimination about the nature and dynamics of the different elements of the model, and this should facilitate more effective practical scaffolding of resilient agency in learning, by teachers and facilitators.

544> First, the scale of mindful agency has proven to be a crucial dimension in the development of learning power.
545> This is because mindful agency is constituted in the self-awareness and confidence to engage and progress in learning to achieve a chosen purpose, the confidence to recognise and recover from negative feelings associated with learning and to plan and manage the self in the processes associated with learning tasks.
546> Mindful agency predicts sense-making, creativity, curiosity and hope, suggesting that mindful agency is the 'motor' of learning power, which is developed through meta-reflection on learning in practice.
547> Awareness and reflection develop through language - even though we often know more than we can say.
548> Mindful agency also reflects a person's relationship with themselves.
549> Sense-making is about making connections between otherwise separate information or data and about learning that is meaningful to the learner.
550> Curiosity is the orientation to want to understand, to get beneath the surface and to 'dig deeper', and creativity is constituted by imagination on the one hand and risk taking and playfulness on the other, such that new value is created.
551> Hope and optimism is about the self-knowledge a person has about being able to grow and change over time - a growth-orientation towards life and learning.
552> This model suggests that to develop mindful agency the learner should expose themselves to varying situations which demand different levels of creativity, curiosity and a sense-making, while being supported to reflect on progress towards what has been achieved.
553> Through this they will have the opportunity to develop the cognitive and emotional awareness necessary to guide their agentic choices about how to learn and in so doing develop the optimism and hope to continue.
554> They will develop resilient agency - the capacity to respond profitably to risk, uncertainty and challenge over time.
555> The model provides a language with which to engage and reflect - and in turn this provides a framework for coaching conversations which focus on empowering learners to 'do it for themselves'.
556> So mindful agency is grounded and given specific meaning through the remaining four active learning dimensions.
557> Mindful agency can also be used to leverage change:
558> as one consciously develops, say, one's ability to ask questions and one's curiosity, through the process of 'consciousness raising', one is also developing mindful agency.
559> The scales that measure learning relationships have now gained greater clarity through this exploration.
560> Collaborating and belonging to a community or group supportive of one's learning are two distinct but related social aspects of learning.
561> The scale 'openness to learning' is a new and improved interpretation of the former 'fragility and dependence' scale which has been dealt with extensively in a separate paper, which we theorise is an emotional and cognitive state of 'openness' to the inter- and intra-personal dynamics of learning power, which precedes the engagement and utilisation of mindful agency.

571> Siegel argues that 'a core aspect of the human mind is an embodied and relational process that regulates the flow of energy and information within the brain and between brains' and that 'the mind is an emergent property of the body and relationships…created within internal neurophysiological processes and relational experiences' (2012, p. 3).
572> Energy and information flow is what is shared between people within cultures, and this is also the 'subject matter' of learning.
573> How a person-in-relation regulates that flow - how they select what matters, make sense out of it and apply it to their purpose - is a process of learning in any domain.
574> This improved model of the internal structure of learning power provides a language for - and hence way of conceptualising - how we can mindfully regulate that flow of energy and information.
575> Theories of agency share the view that organismic aspirations drive human behaviours and that humans are the authors and active agents of their own development (Little et al., 2006RIDCIT0090).

578> In a review of the field, Vansteenkiste and Ryan (2013RIDCIT0129) identify its fundamental organismic-dialectical meta-theory, which offers an understanding of the human being as an active integrator of meaning, developing an ever more elaborated and unified sense of self, which is in dialectical tension with the social contexts which either nurture or inhibit this active, integrating process.
579> From this perspective 'human development and well being must be viewed as a dynamic potential that requires proximal and distal conditions of nurturance' (Ryan and Deci, 2002RIDCIT0108, p. 3).
580> These conditions of nurturance are based on psychological need satisfaction - the need for competence or a sense of effectiveness in interacting with ones environment, the need for relatedness which concerns the experience of love and care by significant others and the need for autonomy or the experience of volition and self-endorsement of one's activity (Vansteenkiste and Ryan, 2013RIDCIT0129, p. 264).
581> They review the evidence for ways in which need frustration and need thwarting lead to passivity, fragmentation and 'ill being', whereas the experience of these needs being met appropriately is a harbinger of proactivity, integration and well-being satisfied (Ryan et al., 2008RIDCIT0109).

586> This energy, or life force, is a 'given' of human nature:
587> under optimal conditions human beings will learn, grow and change towards a coherent sense of self-in-relation to others and to the environment.
588> Whereas under suboptimal or pathological conditions of need frustration or thwarting, people develop 'ill-being', need substitutions and compensatory behaviours, which include releasing self-control and 'rigid' behavioural patterns, which function as a defensive script, which works against integration, coherence and autonomy.
589> The concept of mindful agency modelled here extends the tenets of self-determination theory by giving focus to the ways in which the individual can articulate and reflect on their sense of identity and move forwards in the realisation of their chosen purpose.
590> Together with the 'relationship' dimensions and the 'openness to learning' dimension, this also provides a language for scaffolding learning, particularly in the context of open ended enquiry.
591> The openness to learning scale and the two relationships scales (collaborating and belonging), understood in this context, influence the development of mindful agency because they reflect the conditions or the social environment in which a learner is situated.
592> If the needs for relatedness, satisfaction and competence in relating to ones environment are not satisfied, the evidence suggests that this can be harmful and pathogenic - leading to loss of authenticity, compensatory behaviours and 'rigid behavioural patterns' and mindsets (see Vansteenkiste and Ryan, 2013RIDCIT0129).
593> This helps to explain the patterns of learning power in violent young offenders (which we discuss elsewhere Deakin Crick et al., 2015RIDCIT0035, in preparation) which led us to reconceptualise resilience as a component of learning power.
