    We propose that the design and implementation of effective Social Learning Analytics (SLA) present significant challenges and opportunities for both
     research and enterprise, in three important respects. The first is that the learning landscape is extraordinarily turbulent at present, in no small part 
    due to technological drivers. Online social learning is emerging as a significant phenomenon for a variety of reasons, which we review, in order to 
    motivate the concept of social learning.

    The second challenge is to identify different types of SLA and their associated technologies and uses. We 
    discuss five categories of analytic in relation to online social learning; these analytics are either inherently 
    social or can be socialised. This sets the scene for a third challenge, that of implementing analytics that 
    have pedagogical and ethical integrity in a context where power and control over data are now of primary importance.

    We consider some of the concerns that learning analytics 
    provoke, and suggest that Social Learning Analytics may 
    provide ways forward. We conclude by revisiting the drivers
     and trends, and consider future scenarios that we may see
     unfold as SLA tools and services mature.
