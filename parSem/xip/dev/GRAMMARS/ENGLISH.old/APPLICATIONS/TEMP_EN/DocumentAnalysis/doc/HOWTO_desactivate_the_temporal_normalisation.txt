---------------------------------------
Some people might be interested in precise temporal chunking but
not in normalization and java stuff.
It is then possible to desactivate this normalization:
---------------------------------------

   - in the grm file ($HOME/parSem/xip/dev/GRAMMARS/ENGLISH/APPLICATIONS/SPECTEMP/GRMFILES/gram_temporalExp.grm), a variable TEMPORAL_PYTHON_ACTIVATE is declared.
   - in english.xip file ($HOME/parSem/xip/dev/GRAMMARS/ENGLISH/APPLICATIONS/SPECTEMP/GRMFILES/english_temporalExp.xip), a conditional compilation does the following :
      - if TEMPORAL_PYTHON_ACTIVATE is defined, then temp_functions.py, that perfoms the normalization, is used
      - else, fake_temp.xip is used instead: this file declares the same functions, but these functions don't do anything (but returning 1)
      - this is done is "Rules" section. This section is then written twice. Unfortunately, this means that adding or removing a rule file has to be done twice.

   - If one wants to desactivate normalization, comment the definition of variable TEMPORAL_PYTHON_ACTIVATE in the grm file.

   - Another way to do this is to use the parameter "-variable TEMPORAL_PYTHON_ACTIVATE" when calling XIP. In this case, the definition of the variable in the grm must be commented. The default is no normalization, and it is run only if  "-variable TEMPORAL_PYTHON_ACTIVATE" is specified.
