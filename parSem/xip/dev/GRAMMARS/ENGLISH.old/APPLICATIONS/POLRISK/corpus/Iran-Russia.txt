Georgy Kaurov, spokesman for Russia's atomic energy minister, announces Russia will build two more nuclear reactors in Iran in addition to Russia's $850 million deal to build a 1000MW nuclear power plant at Bushehr. Kaurov says Russia " agreed in principle" with Iran on the construction of two more reactors at Bushehr. Constructionis not expected to begin for five years. This new deal was not a signed contract, but was rather a verbal agreement. Vitaliy Nasonov, a spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry (Minatom) says, " Russia will not sign any new documents with Iran until it has completed the contract to build the nuclear power station at Bushehr." He says Russia is not refusing to expand cooperation with Iran entirely, just "not until the21st century." Russia and Iran initially signed a contract on 8 January 1995 for the first reactor at Bushehr. Russia took over construction of the reactor at Bushehr in February 1998 due to delays by Iran. Kaurov says that Russia plans to speed construction of the current project and expects to finish the reactor in two-and-one-half years. Next, construction would start on two new 640MW power reactors, "which are still being developed." [Note: This seems to be the first mention of 640MWreactors at Bushehr. Previously, two 440MW reactors had been discussed for Bushehr.] An unnamed American official doubts Iran will have enough money to pay for the planned reactors."Whether they can get the first one done is iffy, and the chance of their completing the second, third, or fourth is highly unlikely," the official says.

The IAEA team inspected the research center at Isfahan and the experimental reactor at the University of Tehran four times in the last year. The two reactors under construction at Bushehr were not inspected because no form of nuclear fuel has been transferred there yet.

Also banned will be $326 million of direct US exports to Iran. The executive order is to take effect in the first week of June. Clinton also said he would press US allies to impose similar sanctions. In his speech, Clinton cites Iranian agreements with Russia to buy nuclear reactors and gas centrifuge equipment as proof that Iran is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. The embargo is reportedly a demonstration of US determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and is imposed on the basis that Iran is a terrorist state and is seeking weapons of mass destruction.

Iran reportedly signs a secret deal with Kazakhstan to buy four nuclear warheads, but the CIA stops the deal. In an unsuccessful attempt, the Iranians approach the Ulba Metallurgical Plant within the Ust-Kamenogorsk production complex in Kazakhstan in order to purchase beryllium and enriched uranium. The plant makes reactor fuel and metal components for the defense industry and has 600k g of surplus highly enriched uranium. There are conflicting reports as to why the Iranians wanted to purchase the uranium. Reports indicate that the Iranians sought to use the uranium as reactor fuel or for weapons. According to Ergali Bayadilov, Director General of the Kazak Atomic Energy Agency, Iran wanted to purchase safeguarded low-enriched uranium (LEU) to fuel the soon-to-be supplied Russian VVER-1000 [1000MW light-water] reactor.

Managers at the Canadian Center for Magnetic Fusion in Varennes, Quebec have discussed selling the tokamak reactor, related equipment, and technology to a research center in Iran. The Center expects that the Iranians would hire about 10 researchers from Varennes as consultants. However, Rowan says that a sale would not take place for a long time and would be subject to extensive export control investigation. He says "obviously, fusion reactors are currently experimental and have not been proven capable of producing commercially viable energy nor nuclear explosive devices." In addition, Rowan notes that "Canada does have a policy of controlled engagement with Iran right now. It places limits on bilateral relations with them because of certain Iranian policies in the area of human rights, support for international terrorism, rejection of the Middle East peace process, and its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.".

Pakistan Mulls Nuclear Handover.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf announces he may provide the IAEA with uranium enrichment components to clear Pakistan's name from Iran's nuclear program. "We will give you them and you examine them...but once and for all," President Musharraf said. The parts would help establish the origin of the uranium contamination discovered in Iran and if Tehran has been secretly developing nuclear weapons.

Pinar Bakir, a Turkish businessman and economics professor, is arrested in Turkey for possession of 2.5k g of uranium, which he was allegedly smuggling from Russia to Iran. Four Iranians and four Turkish citizens are arrested in the raid while trying to purchase the uranium from Bakir. Police suspect the four Iranians of working for SAVAMA, the Iranian secret service. Police identify Turker Gelendost, who is among those arrested, as the central figure in the smuggling of the uranium from Russia to Turkey. According to chief of the police anti-smuggling department, Salih Gungor, visitors from Russia brought the uranium into Turkey, where they sold it to Turks. Deputy Head of the Turkish Cekmeci Nuclear Research Center Erol Balikcigil announces that the smuggled material "only has about 2.5 to 3.5% uranium-235 and cannot be used in nuclear weapons manufacture." Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Borujerdi denies that Russian uranium is destined for Iran, calling the case a plot to undermine Turkish-Iranian relations and stating that Iran is willing to cooperate with Turkish security forces in the matter. Iran continues to deny that it is attempting to develop nuclear weapons. Another Iranian is being sought in connection with the case. The uranium was to be sold for $40,000 per gram. However, a specialist at the Cekmeci Nuclear Research Center estimates that "the whole amount was worth only a few thousand dollars.".

Russia Rejects U.S. Claim on Blocking Bushehr Nuclear Energy Project.
According to an unidentified senior State Department official, Russia has been pressuring Iran to open its facilities to intrusive inspections, warning that it may delay or put a halt to Russian assistance with the construction of the nuclear reactor at Bushehr if Iran does not follow through with its promises to the IAEA. However Nikolai Shingarev, spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, rejects the assertion that work might stop on Bushehr, and reaffirms that Russia would in fact " do its best to expedite the process.".

IAEA Spokesman: Iran's Nuclear Program Peaceful.
According to David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has a peaceful nuclear program. In a news conference at United Nations headquarters in Vienna, Kyd stated that the IAEA has regularly inspected Iranian nuclear facilities and has never observed anything, which would indicate that the Iranian nuclear program has any military purposes. Kyd also said that the IAEA is cooperating with Iran to promote the highest international safety standards at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He reminded his audience that Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its nuclear facilities are permanently under IAEA supervision. In addition, Kyd said the IAEA has not received any intelligence from the United States that indicates that Iran is using its nuclear program for producing weapons. The United States and other Western countries have an embargo on numerous dual use items because they believe Iran is using its civilian nuclear program to prepare for producing nuclear weapons. US officials have criticized the IAEA inspections, because they claim that the IAEA failed to detect Iraq's large nuclear program in the 1980s.

Pakistan: Iranian Minister Talks To Media In Islamabad.
Representatives from China, India, Iran, and Russia sign a protocol in Moscow establishing the Asian Fusion Research Foundation to cooperate in the study of nuclear fusion. The final agreement is to be signed in Montreal during an August 1996 expert conference sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Russian officials say financial support for the project was not discussed at the meeting. Western authorities believe the cooperative fusion research will probably aim to establish a tokamak, and, because no fissile materials will be produced, will not pose a proliferation threat. Western officials doubt that the project will receive enough financial support to generate important fusion engineering innovations. [Note: The foundation is also called the Asian Foundation for Thermonuclear Studies. See 29 February and 29 March 1996.].

Atomic Ministry Denies New Nuclear Deal With Iran.
Representatives from the Russian Atomic Ministry deny any other deals for cooperation with Iran once the Bushehr nuclear power plant is completed. They say, however, another unit could be installed at the Bushehr power plant. There have still not been any discussions on this issue, as all depends on the implementation of the Bushehr project. The Russian officials, however, do not rule out further cooperation at the end of this project. The Bushehr agreement provides for the putting in place of two VVER-1000 light water reactors at 1000MW capacity each and two VVER-440 reactors at 440MW capacity each.

Reuters reports that the Clinton administration has complained to the Russian government that Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran exceeds the restrictions Russian President Boris Yeltsin promised two years ago. An anonymous US official also said Washington is concerned that Russian technical advice to Iran's uranium mining and processing efforts could eventually help Iran build a nuclear bomb. According to the official, if Iran acquires the ability to mine and process uranium, it could either enrich it to weapons grade, or irradiate it in a nuclear reactor to produce plutonium.

Reza Amrollahi, Iranian Vice President and President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), says at the International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference that Iran intends to continue construction of the Esteqlal nuclear plant in Bushehr as part of a two-year-old bilateral cooperation agreement with China. According to an Iranian official, Iran would prefer to receive technical assistance from the United States and Europe, but because of the West's reluctance to supply Iran with the necessary nuclear technology and equipment, Iran has been forced to turn to China and Russia for assistance at Bushehr. [Note: The Federation of American Scientists reports that the Esteqlal nuclear plant is at Darkhovin, not Bushehr. See 1993 entry on Esteqlal.

Adamov says that the reactor would use enriched uranium of 20% or less and would meet IAEA requirements. Adamov also says that Russia was planning on " stepping up the pace of construction" at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Russian officials are considering finishing the project on a "turnkey" contract basis. This will allow Russia to raise the price of the reactor from $780 million to just over $1 billion.

Yadernyy Kontrol.
Russian Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov publishes an article in Yadernyy Kontrol. Mikhailov says that agreements with Iran are being developed along the lines of the Bushehr project. Mikhailov attributes the three-year delay in execution of the project to relocating the site from the seismically active northern region of the country, proposed earlier by the Iranians, to its present location in 1995. Additional time was lost because of Iran's insistence on carrying out the construction and maintenance work independently. After Iran made no tangible progress, Minatom took full charge of the construction in 1998; currently there are 600 Russian specialists working on the site. Mikhailov also explains that the Iranian offer for cooperation in uranium mining and enrichment was similar to Minatom's agreement with China, where Russia is building a gas centrifuge plant. Mikhailov asserts that despite criticism by Russian opposition political parties and the United States, Russia must continue its nuclear cooperation with Iran if it wants to retain its allies in the Persian Gulf region and in the Islamic world in general.

...And Presses Ahead With Reactor Deal.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and US Secretary of State Warren Christopher meet in Geneva to discuss US opposition to the pending Russian sale of two light water reactors (LWRs) to Iran. The only agreement reached during the meetings between two parties is a decision to meet again before Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton meet on 9 May 1995 in Moscow. US officials have admitted that the sale of Russian LWRs, worth between $800 million and $1 billion, would not directly assist the Iranians in building a nuclear bomb. The agreement would include the training of Iranian experts in Moscow. Russia has already sent 200 of its own experts to Iran. Iran will reportedly return spent fuel to Russia. The US has argued that the sale would be " counterproductive" to nonproliferation efforts and "could provide cover for Tehran to acquire other technology and materials useful in a weapons program." The US has pointed to a tightening of its trade embargo with Iran; including the cancellation of an agreement worth $1 billion between Iran and Conoco, as evidence of US willingness to accept economic loss.
