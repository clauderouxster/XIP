Gholam Reza Shafei, Iran's ambassador to Russia, rejects the US accusations that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. He adds that the Iranian-Russian agreement has no military dimension and that the International Atomic Energy Agency regularly visits the Bushehr reactor.

Georgy Kaurov, spokesman for Russia's atomic energy minister, announces Russia will build two more nuclear reactors in Iran in addition to Russia's $850 million deal to build a 1000MW nuclear power plant at Bushehr. Kaurov says Russia " agreed in principle" with Iran on the construction of two more reactors at Bushehr. Construction is not expected to begin for five years. This new deal was not a signed contract, but was rather a verbal agreement. Vitaliy Nasonov, a spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry (Minatom) says Russia is not refusing to expand cooperation with Iran entirely, just "not until the21st century." Russia and Iran initially signed a contract on 8 January 1995 for the first reactor at Bushehr. Russia took over construction of the reactor at Bushehr in February 1998 due to delays by Iran. Kaurov says that Russia plans to speed construction of the current project and expects to finish the reactor in two-and-one-half years. Next, construction would start on two new 640MW power reactors, "which are still being developed." [Note: This seems to be the first mention of 640MWreactors at Bushehr. Previously, two 440MW reactors had been discussed for Bushehr]. An unnamed American official doubts Iran will have enough money to pay for the planned reactors."Whether they can get the first one done is iffy, and the chance of their completing the second, third, or fourth is highly unlikely," the official says.
