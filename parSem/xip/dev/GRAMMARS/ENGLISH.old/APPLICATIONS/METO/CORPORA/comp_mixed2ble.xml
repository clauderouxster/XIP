An indication that the acceptability of the concept of headhunting has made great progress among employers in Britain is the fact that many of the respondents attested to search consultants' knowledge of the executive market place, gained over a number of years, and their expertise in certain specialised sectors. 
A spokesman for a large nationalised service industry wrote of headhunters being able to provide them with " the feel of external experience " and an appreciation of the stature in the market place of their existing staff and the organisation itself, together with a more extensive network of contacts than they could possibly have at their disposal.

Otherwise, Sainsbury's considered that they had good connections in the retail trade -- especially through their joint-venture with British Home Stores -- and thus their own recruiting facilities were usually adequate.

Despite the political uncertainties, the communist insurgency and rising crime, the Philippines had begun to attract more foreign investment, particularly from Japan and Taiwan. 
According to Japan's Ministry of Finance, direct investment in the Philippines by Japanese companies in 1987 was $72,000,000, while in 1988 the figure rose to $134,000,000, and in the first six months of 1989 the amount was already $101,000,000. 
Japanese investor confidence faltered with the news of the coup attempt, one immediate result of which was the postponement of a $35,000,000 plan by the Japanese electronics company <annot><org reading="mixed" notes="litmembers"> Sony </org></annot> to build an audio equipment factory near Manila. 
The plant was to have been a symbol of the Aquino government's success in convincing Japanese companies of the country's political stability.

It sees no problem with adding the Alpha architecture to the MIPS Computer Systems Inc and Intel Corp-based systems it currently offers, a trail that DEC is already blazing in any case, but it has to figure out whether and how it will be able to address the window of opportunity it reckons the industry is now creating with the latest round of hardware and software announcements, and of course, how deep it would have to dig into its back pocket. 
Olivetti said its use of Alpha would definitely be restricted to the high-end workstation market: it " has other designs " when it comes to servers, hinting that it may bring out a product in that area based on the parallel processing technology of Kendall Square Research Corp, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company in which it has a stake (see page three).

It is calling on the government to adopt a three-point programme with a view to: i) setting explicit packaging recycling and waste reduction targets; ii) reducing use of hazardous materials in packaging; and iii) increasing the market for recycled materials. 
The new campaign highlights examples from around the world on the effectiveness of recycling. 
These include: * Dutch studies which claim that energy savings of 33 per cent can be achieved by packaging milk in reusable plastic bottles; * savings of around 90 per cent in energy use and polluting emissions achieved by Swiss supermarket chain <annot><org reading="mixed" notes="litmembers"> Migros </org></annot> through a switch from cardboard boxes to re-usable plastic ones; * the success of Sainsbury's " Penny Back " scheme, which encourages shoppers to re-use carrier bags.
