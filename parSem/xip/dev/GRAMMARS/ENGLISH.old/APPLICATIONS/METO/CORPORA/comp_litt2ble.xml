It was inevitable -- and should have been obvious to the kinds of forecasting brains that IBM could afford -- that the open systems movement would spread up from the desktop to infect first the minicomputer world and then the mainframe. 
And that means that even the AS/400 is potentially at risk, and can only continue to be a winner if IBM builds in a big discount to compensate for the fact that it is proprietary -- yet instead of recognising this vulnerability, with its incredible but consistent short-termism, the company is squeezing AS/400 users until they squeal with its software pricing on the machine.

OSF says final contracts specifying who is responsible for re-working and integrating which pieces of DME have yet to be exchanged, although Tivoli Systems Inc boss Frank Moss says " we now report to IBM, not OSF. " 
Aside from integration difficulties, OSF has also been bogged down trying to figure out how to implement a standard version of the Object Management Group's Common Object Request Broker Architecture (Corba), a mechanism for managing objects across distributed systems. 
The fact that the DME framework was not interoperable with other OSF founders' Corba technologies has meant that some layers of DME have had to be re-designed and/or re-written using donated parts of Hewlett-Packard Co's Distributed Object Management Facility and <annot><org reading="literal"> IBM </org></annot>'s System Object Model (SOM). 
IBM is apparently now convinced that DME can succeed -- it will get a distributed object application development environment and Corba-compliant object dispatcher -- and because of the resources available to it, will take over the role of key integrator.

Even if, as I believe, the British Paralympic team are not affiliated to the BOC, the real reason is, as ever, money. 
Large companies such as <annot><org reading="literal"> Coca Cola </org></annot>, Mars and many others pay a great deal of money for the privilege of using the logo.

According to Andrews, Ontos DB -- described as a component object database environment -- resides at a higher level than persistent languages such as C++ and SmallTalk or databases that are simply collections of objects that use C++ topologies rather than SQL. 
Whilst other object players such as Objectivity Inc and Object Design Inc are successfully licensing persistent language products to majors like Microsoft Corp and Sun Microsystems Inc (UX No 405), it is only a matter of time, Andrews argues, before they no longer need the services of third parties. 
The likes of <annot><org reading="literal"> Microsoft </org></annot> and Sun will soon learn to exploit object technology by developing new generations of products that could price small object players out of the market. 
Similarly, databases offered by the current crop of object firms like Versant, Objectivity and Servio Logic, could easily have their market chewed up by the mainstream relational players like Sybase, Ingres and Oracle, which nearly every day are claiming more and more functionality for their products, like inheritance, C++ and objects.

The 11 were arrested on Thursday morning and charged -- along with NatWest Investment Bank, County NatWest Securities and UBS Phillips & Drew Securities -- on 14 counts of conspiracy to defraud persons dealing in the shares of Blue Arrow or NatWest Bank or in options on the FT-SE 100 index. 
The three companies and eight of the defendants were also accused on four counts of fraudulently inducing purchases of shares in Blue Arrow and NatWest Investment Bank, County NatWest Securities and <annotorg> UBS Phillips & Drew Securities </annotorg>. 
The main charges relate to the creation of a false market in Blue Arrow shares between mid-1987 and January 1988, by giving a wrong impression that an £837million rights issue and placing of Blue Arrow shares had been successful.

<annotorg> IBM Corp </annotorg> is to license a version of its CICS/6000 CICS overlay for the Encina transaction processing monitor to Hewlett-Packard Co, which says it will offer it on its HP9000 Precision Architecture RISC-based Unix machines -- but conversion of the IBM product will not be a simple task -- it won't be ready to ship until the second half of 1993. 
The deal is a considerable win for CICS users who have been locked into IBM platforms.

But Micro Focus is bearding its leonine partner <annot><org reading="literal"> IBM Corp </org></annot> in its lair, effectively going head to head with IBM's own CICS/6000 by creating an open system that can run CICS applications and offers links to mainframe CICS systems.

The explosive proliferation of industry bodies continues and the latest brings together ICL Plc, Bell Atlantic Business Systems Services Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co, Microsoft Corp and <annotorg> Sun Microsystems Computer Corp </annotorg>, and the ill they aim to alleviate is the lack of international standards for service and support information in distributed computing environments. 
To that end, they have formed the Distributed Support Information Standards Group and say the standards it will seek to establish will address the concerns of organisations responsible for service, support and management of networked systems.

They apparently engaged in an intimate conversation, destined to emerge in the <annotorg> Sun </annotorg> newspaper last year, as the notorious Dianagate or Squidgy tapes. 
At first, it was believed that Gilbey's call, which would have gone throughn the cellnet system via this relay station at Coldash in Berkshire was intercepted by Cyril Reenan, a retired bank manager from Abingdon.

On other fronts, too, Niki, was proving a leader, the sort of senior driver whose participation in a team was greater than that of a mere employee, and it is to the merit of Ron Dennis and McLaren that Lauda was allowed to play a wider role. 
Here, for instance, there is no doubt that Niki was of substantial help in closing the deal which brought McLaren the hugely successful TAG/Porsche engine, developed by Porsche but financed and sponsored by Mansour Ojjeh, the son of the head of Techniques d'Avant Garde, a French high-tech company with a substantial role in the development of weaponry. 
Because FI, in the wake of <annot><org reading="literal"> Renault </org></annot>, was shifting towards the turbo engine and because McLaren was beginning to develop the TAG/ Porsche engine, 1982 was something of a transitional year at the team and both Niki and his team-mate John Watson suffered in the results table, Watson actually finishing ahead of Niki in the championship, the first time he had ever been upstaged within his own team. 
The year belonged to Keke Rosberg at Williams -- though Ferrari's Didier Pironi might well have won the championship had it not been for his grave accident in the rain at Hockenheim.

The resulting devices will be used with <annotorg> Intel </annotorg>'s 80960 Cx series of superscalar microprocessors to provide a complete building block chip set to reduce chip count by integrating most of the logic functions surrounding the CPU, which should lead to increased reliability and performance, and reduced board space requirements and cost. 
The HP 700/RX stations are claimed to deliver performance of up to 90,000 Xstones, and to be the most powerful X-stations available.

COMPLACENCY is almost a sacking offence at Hunslet Transportation Projects, the Birmingham-based firm which in June 1990 startled railway experts by winning a contract to supply 37 electric passenger trains to Regional Railways. 
It was a remarkable achievement for a company created just over a year earlier and which had had to pitch against some of the world's largest train-builders, including GEC Alsthom, <annot><org reading="literal"> Siemens </org></annot>, and BREL, the dominant British manufacturer. 
Seventeen months later the firm, which employs barely 100 people, carried off another giant-slaying trick by landing a £38 million trains order for the Malaysian railway KTM in the face of competition from BREL and a leading Japanese manufacturer.

Fourth-quarter surge sees Shell top £3bn 
WITH net income rising by 28 per cent to just above £3 billion, 1992 was far from being the feared annus horribilis for the Royal Dutch/Shell group, writes Frank Frazer 
But Sir Peter Holmes, chairman of the UK-based <annot><org reading="literal"> Shell Transport & Trading </org></annot> wing, urged caution yesterday about reading too much into results influenced by changes in accountancy practices to meet new US rules, and currency movements. 
He believed a truer picture of the company's performance was given by earnings figures calculated on a current-cost basis, which rose by just 8 per cent to £3.1 billion on turnover which fell by more than £1 billion to £73 billion.

There have already been suggestions that Wang's deal with IBM to sell the RS/6000 has not lived up to expectations -- in June 1991 IBM took a stake in the financially troubled company, in return for which Wang agreed to sell the AS/400 and RS/6000 machines (CI No 1,697), but late last year said that it would not be adding to its stake as it had the right to do under terms of the agreement. 
Yesterday Wang UK's Freddie Cook admitted that RS/6000 sales were initially slow, adding that demand was now picking up nicely. 
The poor start, he suggested, was partly due to a dearth of applications for <annot><org reading="literal"> IBM </org></annot>'s AIX Unix implementation. 
Cook characterises Hewlett-Packard's Unix as being closer to standard Unix than IBM's and the company's boast of being the worlds largest supplier of Unix systems is an obvious attraction.

Presentation software has now developed a very distinctive approach in which the user simply has to combine their own information, message and logos with an appropriate selection from the wide range of supplied backgrounds that are designed complete with colour palettes and suitable fonts. 
This makes it possible for anybody to create a professionally polished performance that can then be shown to an audience using either the Mac itself, 35 mm slides or overhead projector foils, backed up with printed handouts and speaker notes. 
It is five years since <annotorg> Microsoft </annotorg> originally launched PowerPoint for the Mac and recently it had been outperformed by Aldus Persuasion and CA-Cricket Presents. 
Now PowerPoint has all the features required by up-to-date presentation software -- including a comprehensive range of slide templates.

The purpose test in s13A(2) (a) must continue to be satisfied when interest is paid by the managers on their shares, but the " control by management " test need not be. 
For the other conditions that need to be satisfied for management to obtain interest relief, reference should be made to s360. 
Briefly these can be summarised as follows: (1) The management individuals must take out loans; an overdraft is not sufficient. (2) The loans must be to defray expenditure incurred in acquiring ordinary share capital of a close company complying with s13A(2) as described above, or in lending to such a close company where the money loaned is used wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its business or the business of any of its associated companies provided the latter are also close companies satisfying the conditions of s13A(2). (3) When interest is paid on the manager's loan, Newco must continue to comply with s13A(2)--this means it must continue to satisfy the relevant purpose test rather than that it should continue to remain a close company; in the case of a purchase of shares in <annot><org reading="literal"> Target </org></annot>, the reason why Newco should be close after the institutions commit to invest is to ensure that institutions and management can invest at the same time and that, at that time, Newco is both close and satisfies the relevant purpose test, ie already controls Target; management can not commit Newco to acquiring Target until the institutions have committed to funding Newco, and once they have so committed the institutions are likely to control Newco under s416, so a structure is needed whereby management also controls Newco at this point. 
(4) Each manager must hold at least one ordinary share in Newco and work for more than half his time in the " management or conduct of the company " or an associated company; alternatively he must own more than 5% of the ordinary share capital of Newco (the " material interest " test); for these purposes, the shareholdings of any associate of an individual manager are aggregated with his holding; " management or conduct of the company " (rather than its business) connotes the function of directors and senior managers, so other employees and middle management will not be able to obtain relief, since they are unlikely to have a sufficient holding in Newco to satisfy the material interest test.

The deal, which was agreed by the two airlines in January after BA had pulled out of its original proposed $750 million link-up with USAir in December, confirms the strong negotiating position BA has always been in and puts its aim of becoming a global airline firmly back on course. 
It will also help it to deflect the spotlight trained on it and its relationship with Virgin Atlantic. 
The three biggest US carriers, American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Airlines, had hoped that approval of the BA-USAir deal would have been linked to their gaining a bigger foothold in the UK market and argued that the original $750 million proposal would have given <annot><org reading="literal"> BA </org></annot> wide entry into the US market while restricting US airlines from further expansion into the UK.

The rate of unemployment was drastically reduced and many of the major post-war corporations in America -- General Motors, Boeing, Lockheed, <annot><org reading="literal"> Ford </org></annot>, Chrysler, US Steel etc. -- were granted, for the first time, the government contracts for arms and related equipment which ensured that they had an effective demand for their goods. 
Thus the war gave corporations massive profits and solved the problems of underconsumption.

And with bright, almost gaudy colour schemes including bright blue and really bright red, the £12,500 Wrangler is certainly an eye-catcher, I confirmed after leaving the off-road track for a spin around Renfrewshire. 
Whether the attention it received was due to its classic looks or the fast drying coating of mud which reached on to the roof was difficult to judge, though I suspect, it was the butch overcoat which caught so many eyes. 
The 2.5 litre petrol engine fitted to the cheapest version is a mere toy by US standards but more than lusty enough to give the Wrangler real credibility against the <annot><org reading="literal"> Suzuki </org></annot> and Daihatsu offerings which inhabit this sector of the fast expanding 4X4 market. 
Top speed is 94 mph with standstill to 60 mph available in 13.4 seconds -- figures which are more than respectable at this end of the market, though owners may find that the 20 mpg thirst takes a lot of getting used to compared with the 30-plus of Japanese rivals.

Sun Microsystems Inc's personal computer integration unit, the Billerica, Massachusetts-based SunSelect, has launched NetWare SunLink for Sparc RISC systems, enabling Sun users to link up to Novell Inc NetWare-based MS-DOS, Windows and OS/2-based computers. 
SunSelect says it is aiming the long-promised software at personal computer users who want to integrate their existing Novell local area networks with Sun Sparc systems and those wishing to upgrade the capability of their Intel-based networks with the addition of a host Sparc system. 
NetWare SunLink will allow PC users to share applications data, file and print services across based Unix networks -- with no changes required in the client software -- but most importantly, it provides a Novell NetWare gateway to NFS, <annot><org reading="literal"> Sun </org></annot>'s Network File System which is used widely in the industry.

Rough seas reflect radar signals, producing false echoes which can blind an old radar such as the Type 992. 
The Type 996, though, will be able to spot incoming anti-ship missiles such as Exocet in time for the vessel to defend itself. 
MEL is part of the <annot><org reading="literal"> Philips </org></annot> group, and its contender is heavily based on a radar known as Smart which another Philips company is developing in Holland for the Dutch Navy. 
Although MEL in Britain would build about 70 per cent of any such radars that the Royal Navy ordered, the other British firms are worried that expertise would be lost if an overseas design won.

The high subsidies offered by the UK government to Nissan and by other European governments to encourage Japanese investment gave rise to fears that the Europeans were engaging in " beggar-my-neighbour " subsidy policies, which would benefit the Japanese and give them an unfair competitive advantage when compared to existing producers.
