The results of this measure were that 50 per cent of total manufacturing activity (measured by value added) was left entirely in Nigerian hands. 
While there was certainly an increase in the output of these businesses in the prosperous years of the late 1970s it is doubtful if they did more than keep pace with the fast growth rate for the manufacturing sector as a whole, estimated by the World Bank to be 12 per cent from 1970 to 1982.

In theory, during this period their potential to adapt technology to source inputs locally (as had occurred in Biafra during the civil war), rather than to import them might have given them a competitive edge over the large manufacturing companies managed and partly owned from overseas.

Operating from one of several palatial villas in Marbella, Spain, al-Kassar was publicly one of the DEA's most wanted fugitives and privately one of the CIA's most useful " capabilities ", having supplied hundreds of tons of US and Eastern bloc arms to Iran, as part of Oliver North's efforts to secure the release of American hostages, and to the Nicaraguan Contras as part of Oliver North's efforts to unseat the Sandinistas.

After an unsuccessful attempt to depose his brother Hafez Assad from the presidency in 1984, Rifat had been banished to Paris, a punishment akin to being kicked out of purgatory and forced to live in paradise.

France bans Australian waste imports. 
The Environment Minister, Ségolène Royal, has banned the importation of certain types of industrial waste from Australia. 
After an authorized shipment of electric transformers arrived in <annot><location reading="unknown"> France </location></annot> and was transported to a specialist factory in Saint-Vulbas for decontamination, the minister announced that no such shipments would be allowed in the future. 
The decision was taken in response to a campaign by Greenpeace against the international trade in waste products and in the wake of a scandal involving the illegal importation of hospital waste from Germany [ see ED 62 ].

The range of the diary is extremely limited: Kilvert was not widely read, and he was uninterested in politics and ideas in general. 
The public events of his time leave little mark; and, apart from occasional visits to London and Oxford and an account of a holiday in Cornwall, which is one of the diary's tours de force, his record hardly strays outside the very narrow circumferences of rural Radnorshire and rural Wiltshire. 
(Kilvert paid at least two visits to <annot><location reading="unknown"> France </location></annot> and Switzerland, but neither of these is covered by the diary: in 1878 he was also offered the English chaplaincy at Cannes, but refused it.) 
It is also true that Kilvert had no gift for self-analysis, and further that the diary was impoverished by his widow's removal from it of the volumes which apparently described not only their courtship and marriage, but the two most profound of Kilvert's previous affairs of the heart; though she left the frequent passages describing Kilvert's passionate attachments to young girls, whose fundamentally erotic nature it is clear that neither she nor Kilvert himself recognized.

It was reported on Sept. 21, 1990, that the Paris Club had launched a strategy offering more favourable terms for lower-middle-income countries (defined as countries with per capita incomes of between US$700and $1,000). 
A commitment in principle to aid countries in this category had been made at the Houston G-7 summit in July [ for which see p. 37629 ]. 
Four countries (<annot><location reading="unknown"> El Salvador </location></annot>, Honduras, Morocco and Congo, with total foreign debts of US$30,500 million) took advantage of the move, agreeing to packages spreading repayments over a period of 15 years -- instead of the 10 years previously allowed by the Club.

The final hurdle was overcome on Dec. 18, when the Ministers approved a directive on the question of solvency and capital adequacy for banks-an issue which had already caused deep disagreement, notably in West Germany, where fears had been expressed that it would lead to a dilution of the sector's relatively high national standards. 
The main disagreements had centred on the question as to whether banking and securities firms should be allowed to include risk investments (ie shares in other companies), rather than merely cash deposits, when they were declaring the capital on which their financial integrity was assessed for authorization purposes. 
Whereas this practice was widespread in the UK, it was banned in most other EC member states; UK observers noted that its abolition in the UK would force <annot><location reading="unknown"> UK </location></annot> institutions to double their cash holdings, a factor which they said would raise costs and which could thus jeopardize the dominant position of the London market in European equity trading (see also p. 36494). 
The European Commission had already given ground to the UK in November 1989, by modifying its insistence that securities businesses should hold capital equivalent to 20 per cent of outstanding exposure, demanding instead a level of 8 per cent.

THE President of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, appealed yesterday for international intervention to halt the conflict consuming his country after Serbian rebels virtually blockaded the capital, Sarajevo, and continued a drive into the republic. 
" I call on the international community, the UN Security Council, the EC and all governments to use their powers to prevent the aggression against Bosnia and Hercegovina, " Mr Izetbegovic said in a TV and radio address. 
Mr Izetbegovic, a Muslim, also called on President Milosevic of Serbia to " stop the terror in <annotloc> Bosnia </annotloc> " by ordering the removal of all paramilitary groups that had invaded his republic and clashed with forces loyal to Bosnia. 
He renewed an appeal to the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav army to prevent further massacres in Bosnia, where hundreds of civilians have been killed in the past month.

The iconography of a state's coinage viewed over a period of time can reveal a certain amount of information about the aspirations of that state, since the choice of designs will normally reflect the matters considered important by at least an influential body in that state and will present these important matters in a particular way. 
In the modern world, for instance, one might look at the development of the personification of Britannia as an index of the growing imperialism of Britain (fig. 20). 
We are, of course, familiar with a heavily armed Britannia brandishing a trident and ruling the waves, but her development in this way is simply an indication of <annot><location reading="unknown"> Britain </location></annot>'s preoccupation with military conquest since the seventeenth century. 
There is no a priori reason why she should have been modelled on the warlike goddess Minerva (or Roma); indeed, on an Italian medal made in 1564, Anglia (as she then was, before the unification of the kingdoms) appears as a simple female figure dressed in the ordinary clothes of daily life.

If you've found my column occasionally depressing over the past three or so years because of my doom-mongering, you should try reading The Great Reckoning by James Dale Davidson and Lord Rees-Mogg. 
This book ought to have a free razor-blade stuck to its front cover. 
Subtitled How The World Will Change In The Depression Of The 1990s, its central hypothesis is that we are headed for a major depression, that deflation will return, that property prices will collapse by two-thirds, that Islam will pour into the power vacuum left by communism, that taxes will soar, that many major corporations will cease to exist, that anyone wealthy enough will flee big cities and away from the gangs controlling them, that countries like <annot><location reading="unknown"> India </location></annot>, Canada, South Africa and Israel will fall to bits, that there will be plagues of locusts and frogs and that firstborn sons ought to head for the hills while they've got the chance. 
All good sensational stuff, but the all-important question is, is it going to happen?

Alternatively, the heating of the smoke plume due to its absorption of solar energy may have been more important than the reduced surface heating such that a net warming of the lower atmosphere produced a slight enhancement of the Asian summer monsoon overall (Browning et al., 1991) or over specific areas such as the Tibetan plateau (Bakan et al., 1991). 
Generally, it is agreed that whatever the magnitude of the effects of the soot plumes on the monsoon, it will have been within the range of natural interannual variability and very difficult, if not impossible, to substantiate.

However, computer simulations using state-of-the-art general atmospheric circulation models undertaken in Britain, Canada, Germany and the United States all suggest the fires will have added only 2-5 per cent to world emissions of carbon dioxide in 1991 and that this increase will not have had a significant influence on world climate change.

The British foreign office, for example, had in 1835--41 a short-lived China department, the result of the ending in 1833 of the East India Company's monopoly of trade with China and of the growing tensions which erupted in the " Opium War " of 1839--42.

Halting of oil supplies by Saudi Arabia -- Expulsion of Jordanian diplomats -- Recall of Jordanian ambassador 
It was announced on Sept. 19 that the Jordanian government had received notification that Saudi Arabi would cut oil supplies immediately due to the non-payment of oil bills amounting to US$46,000,000. 
Jordan had turned to Saudi Arabia for its oil supplies when it committed itself to the UN embargo on trade with Iraq and <annot><location reading="unknown"> Kuwait </location></annot> [ see p. 37639 ]. 
The Saudi decision was reported to have stemmed from Saudi Arabia's determination to force Jordan to fall into line with the Western consensus on the Gulf crisis [ see p. 37637; see below for Jordanian endorsement of radical Arab meeting in Amman in mid-September ].

Thus even these reduced targets were not met: actual commissioning levels were 37 per cent below target in 1949, 19 per cent below in 1950 and 42 per cent below in 1951, with the programmed stations for these years being rolled over into 1952 and 1953. 
This shortfall arose partly because, even when difficulties could be foreseen, it was sensible to aim high and maintain manufacturers' confidence in a sustained market growth, though, as we shall see, it also reflects a persistently poor record for the British power station construction industry on completion times.

There were limits to the range of territory that could be held together in this way in the sixteenth century: towards the end of his life Charles V abdicated and retired to a monastery, leaving his German lands and his title of Holy Roman Emperor to the line of his brother Ferdinand, even though he would probably have preferred to keep the entire empire together and leave it to his son Philip.

We should also have to do without Rome, la Grece et les monarchies hellenistiques by Maurice Holleaux (Paris, 1921), who spent so much intelligence and acumen in trying to make sense of Polybius through the hypothesis that Rome blundered into empire by overrating the aggressive intentions of the Hellenistic states.

Part of the problem, certainly, was the slow and inadequate response of the central authorities and of Gorbachev personally to a deepening crisis.

The failure of Soviet nationalities policy, however, was more than a personal failure; it also reflected the failure, over more than seventy years, to devise an official theory that could adequately account for ethnic and national differences, and perhaps a still deeper weakness in a doctrine that insisted working men " had no country ".

There is also a strong nucleus of contemporary artists centred around the Art College of Madeira (Instituto Superior de Artes Plasticas da Madeira -- ISAPM) which has students from Madeira and <annotloc> Portugal </annotloc> taking courses in art, sculpture, graphics and visual art. 
The tourist office and the local artists' community are keen to promote art and there are often exhibitions of some art form in the theatre or the tourist office's art gallery.

Overall, the money markets saw an ebbing of confidence in the United States dollar and a slight improvement in prospects for the German mark, while sterling ended the year close to where it had started. 
The fair performance of the German currency appeared to discount the difficulties which many traders envisaged in the wake of German unification and, more specifically, of the controversial decision to unite the East and West German marks at par value, a move which was to weaken confidence in the mark in early 1991. 
Central bankers were also concerned in the spring of 1991 that the German government might attempt to stave off the pressure on the mark by raising interest rates, a move which they felt would further depress the prospects for world economic growth; by April, however, it appeared that global interest rates were at last starting to come down, with particularly strong declines in the United Kingdom, the <annot><location reading="unknown"> United States </location></annot> and France. 
The stability of sterling improved significantly following its entry to the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European monetary system in October 1990 [ see p. 37782 ], but sterling experienced a period of doubt shortly before the resignation of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in November [ see pp. 37839-40 ], recovering strongly toward the end of January 1991.

The action was described as a " very dangerous precedent for European political co-operation " by the Irish Foreign Minister and current President of the Council of Ministers, Gerry Collins. 
The other 11 states had agreed only to allow <annotloc> South Africa </annotloc> to " re-engage in cultural and scientific co-operation " as a gesture of encouragement to de Klerk. 
The UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had already announced on Feb. 2, immediately after de Klerk's speech, that the UK would drop its commitment to discourage cultural, academic and scientific contacts.

One possible explanation for governments' concern about inflation is that they are fearful that a rising rate may get out of control and develop into a " runaway " inflation or hyperinflation. 
In a hyperinflation, the price level rises so rapidly that money very quickly becomes almost worthless and people with savings in monetary form find that their money holdings cease to have any real value.

There were those, again, in Germany as elsewhere, for whom the terms " Hellas " and " liberty " were axiomatically linked: a link symptomatized and strengthened by the warm interest taken by many German writers in the Greek struggle for independence, whose fruition followed in the wake of the French Revolution.

France has no environmental policy for French Guiana, despite all of its major national research institutes having bases in the country, from which long-standing research has been conducted.

His career was not without its less attractive moments, and it is sad that many fans will remember the famous picture in the 1981 Wisden of him kicking down the stumps after having an appeal refused in New Zealand almost as readily as they will recall his wonderful bowling; yet even in dissent he was physically graceful, and the picture is positively balletic. 
The fact that he could get such good results by orthodox bowling also left one wondering why he occasionally indulged in a bouncer war, for it obviously did his reputation no good and was not as a rule very productive.
