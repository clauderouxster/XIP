Hello and welcome to the testing part of of Metonymy Resolution at Semeval2007!


Please read the following instructions carefully.



####################################

I. Time Frame

As this task contains two subtasks, you will have *two weeks* to submit your test results from the download date of this test data.
The trial data, which corresponds to training data, can be kept as long as you want before submitting your results.



######################################

II. News groups and Web Page

You should check the task web page  http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/markert/MetoSemeval2007.html as well as the
general SemEval web page  http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/ regularly for Updates. The general SemEval web page also
includes general participant guidelines that you should follow---note, however, that this task deviates from these guidelines in allowing a different
time frame (see above).

The task web page http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/markert/MetoSemeval2007.html allows you to register for
the metosemeval07 newsgroup. We recommend that you do so to get all possible information.

II. Submission format

a) Please follow the submission format detailed clearly in Guidelines.updated.pdf. 

b) For illustration the directory SampleSubmissions contains two sample submission files, using the correct 
samplenumbers from the test data.

c) Each participating team is allowed *one* submission  which can contain up to three files for each subtask (thus up to 6 files overall; see Guidelines.updated.pdf). 
Participants must upload a *single* tarball with the output files
for all subtasks they participate in. If multiple tarballs are uploaded all but the last will be automatically discarded.





###################################

III. Directory structure and Data


All files that are necessary for the testing part of this challenge are included at
the TOP LEVEL of this directory. 
This especially concerns

a) the testing files countries.test and companies.test, which include text snippets
 of a country/company name in each snippet. As this is the testing phase all metonymy annotation has been replaced 
by reading="unknown".

b) The file guidelines.updated.pdf which describes the task, data format, annotation categories that
systems have to distinguish, submission types and format and evaluation. Please follow these guidelines in preparing your submission.


All information in subdirectories includes additional information (tagged data, grammatical annotation, evaluation scripts etc.)
that you might find useful but that is not necessary to use for participation.

We are very thankful for the British National Corpus (BNC)  Consortium to allow us to use BNC data. Please take the COPYRIGHT 
restrictions seriously.

##############################################################

IV. Relation to trial/training data


The directory has exactly the same structure as for the trial data. To facilitate participation, general information like
full annotation guidelines etc. has been repeated. The following description details the connection to the same files in the trial/training data.


a) full_annotationguide, Scripts are unchanged

b) Top level data files, BNCtagged and BNCtagged-standoff data files , grammannot data files contain the
test data instead of training data but are otherwise in the same
format. The only change is that gold standard readings have been replaced by "unknown".
The DTDs are the same apart from allowing for this "unknown" value.

c) COPYRIGHT has been slightly updated.

d) SampleSubmissions are now sample submissions with test data samplenumbers, otherwise same format

e) The general guidelines  guidelines.updated.pdf contain some
small additions to the previous guidelines.pdf so please have another
look. Obviously the general task description, target classes and submission format has not changed.
Additions are clearly marked in the margin by a *NEW* marker.



Have fun!
