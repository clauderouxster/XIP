This directory contains two sample submissions, exemplifying
naming conventions and submission format. 

Both files have not been generated by metonymy resolution algorithms,
but were only created to exemplify the submission format.

NLPuni.location.fine exemplifies a partial submission with the value
"unknown" for examples that are not covered. NLPcompany.org.medium
is a complete submission. 

In contrast to the Sample Submissions in the trial/training data, the sample submissions here
use the correct test data sample numbers.
