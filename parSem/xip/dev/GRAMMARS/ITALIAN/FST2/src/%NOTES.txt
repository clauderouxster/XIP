Notes about the construction of lexicon file lex-func.lexc
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All combined words which can be separated at tokenizer level are removed
such as  
- elided article + noun (l'uomo => l'  uomo)
- conjunction + X  ch'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Conjunctions

reclassification
- additional features +Coord or +Subord
- removed conjunctions that are rather Adverbs
- added some multi-word conjunctions 
  => category "+PreConj" becomes redundant

GOAL: exclude all entries with +Conj from original FST
      (including contracted or combined forms!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Prepositions

- simple prepositions extracted and updated
- prepositions with articles reorganised
- added some multi-word preposititions 
  => category "+PrePrep" becomes redundant

GOAL: exclude all entries with +Prep from original FST
      (including contracted or combined forms!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Articles, determiners
- definite article lo, il
- indefinite article uno
- determiners questo, quello, codesto, tale

GOAL: exclude all entries with +Art and +Det from original FST
      (including contracted or combined forms!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) pronouns, quantifiers
- reclassified personal pronouns
- indefinite, interrogative, realtive pronouns
- determiners questo, quello, codesto, tale

GOAL: exclude basic entries with +Pron, +Quant, +PronQuant from original FST
      (NOT including contracted verb forms!)
