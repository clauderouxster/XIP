  Johnny Cash

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

J. R. Cash (February 26 , 1932  -
September 12 , 2003 ) was an American
 country music  singer and
songwriter. He was sometimes known as John R., and "Johnny" later in
life--and also simply as "the man in black."

He was born in Kingsland, Arkansas , the
son of a poor farmer. His family soon moved into a farm in Dyess,
Arkansas provided cheaply by the government as
part of the New Deal and by age five
he was working in the cotton fields. He began playing guitar and writing
songs as a young boy and in high school sang on a local radio station. 

After serving in the United States Air Force
, Cash moved to Memphis, Tennessee
 where he sold appliances and studied to be
a radio announcer. At night, he played in a trio and one day approached
Sam Phillips  at Sun Records .
Because he had been singing mainly gospel tunes, Phillips said "/go home
and sin, then come back with a song I can sell/." He did and in 1955
 his first recording at Sun, "Cry Cry Cry", was released,
meeting with reasonable success on the country hit parade
.

His next record, "Folsom Prison Blues", made the country Top 5, and "I
Walk the Line" was number one on the country charts, making it into the
pop charts Top 20. In 1957 , Johnny Cash became the first
Sun artist to release a long-playing album. The following year he left
Sun to sign a lucrative offer with Columbia Records where his single,
"Don't Take Your Guns to Town," would become one of his biggest hits.

Within a few years, Johnny Cash had to battle drug problems that
severely affected his career and on several occasions he wound up
spending a night in jail, charged with a variety of offenses. Despite
this, his record, "Ring of Fire," went to number one on the country
charts and broke the Top 20 on the pop charts.

Although Cash carefully cultivated a romantic outlaw image, he actually
spent very little time behind bars. While on tour in 1965, he was
arrested by the narcotics squad in El Paso, Texas
 for attempting to smuggle amphetamines into the
country stashed inside his guitar case, but he only received a suspended
sentence. He was also arrested the next year for trespassing late at
night onto private property to pick flowers. More notably, he
voluntarily entered California's Folsom State Prison
 in 1968 to perform 19 songs in a classic
live concert that was recorded in front of approximately 2,000 convicted
felons.

The mid 1960s  saw Cash release a number of concept
records, including /Ballads Of The True West/ (1965) -- an experimental
double record mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken
narration, let down by the modern arrangements -- and /Bitter Tears/
(1964), with songs highlighting the plight of the native Americans
. However, his drug addiction deepened, and his
destructive behaviour led to a divorce and numerous problems performing.

For his album, /Bitter Tears/ Cash recorded the Peter LaFarge song
called "The Ballad of Ira Hayes." The song told the true saga of Hayes,
a Pima Indian who was who was one of the Marine heroes of the epic WWII
 battle at Iwo Jima . Despite his heroism,
Hayes returned home to crushing despair and to the racism that never
disappeared: "Ira Hayes returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land/
He was wined and speeched and honoured, everybody shook his hand/ But He
was just a Pima Indian, no water, no home, no chance/ At home nobody
cared what Ira had done, and when do the Indians dance?" Though "The
Ballad of Ira Hayes" was a No. 3 country single, many stations refused
to play it, deeming it too risky. Cash took out a full-page ad in
Billboard denouncing country radio for its reluctance. " 'Ballad of Ira
Hayes' is strong medicine," he wrote. "So is Rochester -- Harlem --
Birmingham and Vietnam."

The personal problems continued until he moved to Nashville, Tennessee
, purchasing a home at Old Hickory Lake
next door to his friend Roy Orbison , whose home
burned down in 1968 , claiming the lives of his two young
sons. Deeply affected by Orbison's tragedy, Cash was trying to make
changes in his life, including his marriage to June Carter
 (a member of the Carter Family
), who had co-written "Ring of Fire", that year.

With Carter's help, and influenced by a religious conversion experienced
during a failed suicide attempt, he overcame his addictions and became a
born-again Christian . Soon, Johnny Cash released his
most successful album ever titled "/Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison/." The
following year, he released another prison album titled, "/Johnny Cash
at San Quentin/" that included Shel Silverstein
's "A Boy Named Sue." Released as a single, "A
Boy Named Sue " went to number one on the country
charts and to number three on the US Top Ten pop charts.

Immensely popular, and an imposing tall figure, he began performing
dressed all in black, wearing a long black knee-length coat. Dubbed
"/The Man in Black/." This stemmed from the fact that most of the major
acts in his day wore rhinestones
 and cowboy boots, and he
wanted to do express something different. In 1971 , Johnny
wrote the song "Man in Black" to help explain his dress code: "I wear
the black for the poor and the beaten down,/ Livin' in the hopeless,
hungry side of town,/ I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for
his crime,/ But is there because he's a victim of the times."

In 1969  he had his own television show on the ABC
 network and sang with Bob Dylan
 on Dylan's country-rock album, "/Nashville Skyline/."

In the mid-'70s , Cash's popularity and hit songs began to
decline, but his autobiography, titled "Man in Black" was published in
1975  and sold 1.3 million copies. (A second, "Cash: The
Autobiography", appeared in 1998). In 1980 , Cash became the
Country Music Hall of Fame's youngest living inductee at 48, but during
the 1980s  his records failed to make a major impact on the
country charts, though he continued to tour successfully. In the mid
1980s  he recorded and toured with Waylon Jennings
, Willie Nelson  and Kris
Kristofferson  as the Highwaymen
, making two hit albums.

As his relationship with record companies and the Nashville
establishment soured, he occasionally lapsed into self-parody, notably
on "Chicken In Black".

His career was rejuvenated in the 1990s . Unwanted by major
labels he signed with Rick Rubin
's "American Recordings
" label, better known for rap  and
hard rock  than country music. Under Rubin's
supervision he recorded the album /American Recordings/ (1994) in his
front room, accompanied only by his guitar, which was well received by
critics, while his versions of songs by more modern artists such as
heavy metal  band Danzig
 and Tom Waits  helped to bring
him a new audience. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994
 Glastonbury Festival  was one
of the highlights of his career.

The formula was repeated on /Unchained/ (1998) which, in addition to
many of Cash's own compositions, contained songs by Soundgarden
 ("Rusty Cage") and Beck  ("Rowboat"), as
well as a guest appearance from Flea, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers
.

In 1997  Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative
disease Shy-Drager syndrome  -- a diagnosis
that was later altered to autonomic neuropathy
, associated with diabetes -- and his
illness forced him to curtail his touring, and he was hospitalised in
1998  with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs. The
album /A Solitary Man/ (2000) contained his response to the illness,
typified by a version of Tom Petty 's "I Won't Back
Down", as well as a powerful reading of U2 's "One".

Over the course of his career, Johnny Cash won 11 Grammy 
awards, one of which came for a 1985 album with Roy Orbison
, Carl Perkins  and Jerry Lee
Lewis . Titled, "/The Class Of '55/," the record
celebrated their debut days at Sun Records . He
received a Grammy Award  for Lifetime Achievement in
1999.

Johnny Cash was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame
 in 1980 and the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame  in 1992 . In 1996
 he was honored with a Kennedy Center Award
 and he has a Star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame  at 6320
Hollywood Blvd.

In 2002 , he was honored at the Americana Awards show with a
"Spirit of Americana Free Speech Award".

Cash released /American IV: The Man Comes Around/ (2002) consisting
partly of original material and partly of covers, some quite surprising.
The video for "Hurt", a song originally by Nine Inch Nails
, was nominated in seven categories at the 2003
 MTV Video Music Awards  and
won the award for Best Cinematography.

His wife, June Carter Cash , died due to
complications following heart valve surgery, on May 15 ,
2003  at the age of 71.

Johnny Cash died due to complications from diabetes, which resulted in
respiratory failure, while hospitalized at Baptist Hospital in
Nashville, Tennessee .
