    Internship Report .
         Part A + B.







Executive Summary.
My name is Z. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Telecommunications Engineering  Degree at the University of Technology Sydney. This self-reflective report reviews and accounts  for many aspects of my first internship experience. It contains experience and knowledge gained during the internship, reflections on these experiences, University studied knowledge been implemented on real engineering projects, participation in many different projects, Ethical issues, social well-being and sustainability issues, what was learnt, what has changed to me  as a junior engineer and most importantly how this internship experience have altered my plans for future career and  the second internship.
















Internship Interview and Process.
The company where I took my first internship is called 'Wired and Wireless Solutions International'. In this report WWSI will be used as an abbreviation for the company name. This junior internship position was found on I2MS. Before securing the internship position at WWSI, I have gone through several other interviews across a broad range of engineering disciplines. This consisted of both group interviews and individual interviews. However, I was not successful in securing any of these positions. .
Prior going to the interview at WWSI, I reflected on what occurred in the other interviews and thought about why I wasn't successful in those interviews. The majority of my reflection was drawn from the second last interview which I had with AttachÃ© Software. The interviewer not only interviewed me but also educated me in several ways. The interview started as a group interview consisting of five candidates completing quizzes and personality tests. The interviewer then took us one by one to conduct individual interviews. At the end we were told that only one candidate would be offered the position and that the position was between me and another candidate. I knew they would choose him because it was his second internship, he is more experienced than me and the most important factor was that I did not perform well during the individual interview. .
From that interview, I realized what my weaknesses were when compared to other candidates and my intention was to improve on these weaknesses and successfully secure an internship. What I found was when conducting the individual interview I was very nervous and when asked about my attributes and my personal skills. I did not answer with confidence, was too eager to answer the question without thinking. I was very nervous at the time, I knew I had to find a way to stay calm and present the best of me to the employer as interviews are only a short time for the employer to see what potentials you have and what you can bring to the company.
I did some research on interview techniques. I found that the way to present your attributes and skills is essential. The sequence in which you deliver the skills you want to express does matter and will affect the interviewer, eg; 'intelligent>industrious>impulsive>critical>stubborn>envious' to describe yourself. It will have a more positive effect on the interviewers rather than if you start with envious and work your way backwards because the stubbornness of an intelligent person is seen as likely to be justified and may actually evoke respect, but intelligence in an envious and stubborn person makes him more dangerous and unreliable, this is known as the halo effect. I followed this guide line and had this in mind for my next internship.
During the interview with WWSI, On of the senior partner and HR manager interviews me. I tend to cope with individual interviews more comfortably. I presented my strength and weaknesses in confidence. I performed the halo effect on the two interviewers. It seemed to work as I was informed the next day that I have secured the position.

In the future with other interviews, there are aspects in which I need improve on. For example I noticed when applying for positions on I2MS or other websites, I did not receive much replies. I assumed that it may be the fact that too many candidates applied. But after close investigation and research i concluded that my resume did not provide substantial information that meets the criteria of the position. I reviewed my resume and found that I used the same resume for all internship application. I did not target the criteria with my resume, which was missed when i studied engineering experience preview 1. In the future I will target different positions with different attributes in my resume. It is important for me to know what the company is looking for and change accordingly. It will also be beneficial to research and evaluate on the company background and culture. .
Two other factor also needs to be changed for future job application. I need to advance my interview skills from all aspects. Many videos online illustrate how to be successful in a interview. It presents different ways to prepare for individual and group interview. One important  factor i picked up is to bring a spare copy of the resume for yourself to view as the interview progresses. I have taken into account these tips and I am planning on visiting workshops or online resources to broaden my skills. The other factor became obvious when I started my job search. Telecommunications engineering involves a range of different engineering disciplines.  Such as networking, electrical and IT. Programming is very important as many of the internship positions require some level of programming skills. I plan on revising what I learnt in Embedded C and advance into different programming languages. I have used www.code.org to learn and study with different people on different programming languages. This website is a free and open source platform where anyone can learn to program. It is very convenient and can be used anywhere with internet access. It had already broadened my knowledge about programming and with persistence and time it will advance my programming skills to industry level. .
With these improvements it will Borden my chances to secure a job position in the future.


Company Structure/Outline .
My first internship started on 27/2/2013 and ended on 15/8/2013 with a duration of 24 weeks. WWSI has three different sectors around the world including Sydney, Asia and North America.  I was stationed in Sydney, the company's headquarter. WWSI is located on level 7, 6 Help street Chatswood. WWSI is a private company and is classified as small to medium enterprise. The Company structure consists of Owner/Project Manager Peter in charge of the direction of the company and managing large scale projects. Second in charge is Partner/District Manager Tony who deals with liaison with clients, councils and takes part in the Human resource sector. Then comes the district manager stationed around the world. The rest of the company consists of senior engineers, technicians, marketing team, assistants and interns. Here below is the Organisation chart that briefly specifies the structure of the company.
WWSI consists of two major field. One offers a wide range of Duress systems. This includes emergency services, man-down handsets, panic systems, wired and wireless projects, system maintenance and cordless phone systems. They provide these products to different industries such as military, mines fields, hospitals, personal use, power plants and many more. Some of the leading organizations that use these products are BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and AGL, Hospitals such as Sydney Westmead, Concord and Brisbane.
The other field is more a combination of service and product, the company provides networking, mesh network setup, project planning, project management, network maintenance and many more. Some of the projects that i was involved in include setting up mesh network with free WIFI at Double Bay Council , Anzac stadium and World Square in Town hall Sydney.  .
The company already had two interns when i first started. One of the intern is called Anthony, he  worked in WWSI for 3 month and is at the end of his internship. He taught me and the other intern how to assemble and program many of the systems that we manufacture. I worked harder to make sure i could keep up the work when Anthony left the company. The systems weren't hard to assemble and program, but I needed more practice to become faster and more accurate. This wasn't the first time that I had hands on experience, unlike other people at the same age; I have already gone through many jobs. But it was very interesting working in the field you are studying in. .
My supervisor Karthick. He is skilled in wireless transmission technology. I had to bond with my supervisor and other people in the company as I wish to learn more from them. Some of the project Karthick worked on is Anzac Stadium, this project was still in the planning phase and our company have been chosen to design, survey and install routers to provide full WIFI coverage of the entire stadium. I had a look at the CAD (auto cad files) files of the stadium and discussed with Karthick.
My role in the company is the intern. I was involved in many projects, duress systems and troubleshooting. The list below shows the technical skills I learn while working at WWSI.
 Maintaining OH&S compliance while working on production floor and on-site.
 Providing customer support/troubleshooting either on the telephone, face-to-face or through email.
 Establishing Quality Control/Quality Assurance procedures on all products.
 Responsible for the servicing and maintenance of telecommunication devices such as Ericsson DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) handsets .
 Involved in various production activities associated with TWIG Safety & GPS Tracking devices and Duress Safety & Security Technologies including assembly, programming and enrolling.
 Meeting clients on site and providing them with technical services and routine management.
 Testing troubleshooting and configuration industrial radios and modems .
 Doing data and electric cabling .
 Dialing in and subscribing Ericsson cordless handsets.
 Remotely Managing cordless systems for numerous clients.
 Assisted in installing network cables and equipment's for numerous projects.
 Development, installation, and setting up, of numerous wireless systems.
 Assisting other engineers in the installation, set-up, and maintenance of numerous PABX systems.
 Assisting other engineers in documenting on-site work.
 Performing on-site testing, configuring and documentation on various projects.
 Worked on several telecommunication and networking products such as Ruckus Zonefelx and Zone director, Ekuhau systems and on-site surveying .
 Liaison with different companies and councils  .

Working and Learning .

As my time in the company elapsed, I got more involved in the operation and routine of the company. Projects and small assignments were always passed on to me to finish or to document in the system. Although it was a vague process, i still gained some experience in managing documentations and communications between each department. .
One instance of this is when Peter gave instructions to figure out a way to remotely switch off and on a server which Is located in Singapore. Team viewer (software that allows two pc to connect and share connection) can be used to achieve the remote control over the long distance. I searched online for products that act as a switch and a device that controls that switch. I found the Damocles Mini which was a device that acts like a control Centre. It is  operated with a web based interface. Later i found a power switch named Power Egg. I placed an order for the two items. I started going through the manuals of these two devices, I needed to figure out how to connect these two devices together and also within the network. When the device arrived in the Company I was able to take a look and start assembling straight away. .
First I used a computer (which is used to be similar to a server)  I connected the power cable from the computer through to the Power Egg, the other end of the Power Egg into the wall socket. Then using the dry contacts on the Power Egg, I connected the Damocles Mini to it using stranded wires. Next stage is connecting the Damocles to the computer with a Ethernet cable, set the IP address of my computer to match the Damocles mini and start up the web interface. The setup is quite easy and I got the device working straight away, I was able to shut off the computer and turn on the computer from anywhere within the network. After a series of tests over various devices and networks. I concluded that this setup is suitable for the Singapore  servers. Before i disassembled the connections and pack it. I need to write a report detailing on how to setup the system, this will aid the technician at Singapore. The report needs to be simple but informative so the technician can understand and setup correctly. .
Documenting an official report needs to follow the companies guidelines. Text need to be in Times New Roman with size of 12 and spacing of 1. It needs to have a company letter head, person who signed off the report. Report must be in professional engineering language and correct format. .
I also encountered a problem other technician could not solve. It happened to a few of the customer who ordered the Mini-Pacc system with a man down transmitter. They had trouble with the transmitter triggering the Mini-Pacc system. I got a few calls asking me to troubleshoot their system, after going through all the problems. I was not able to fix their system, so I had to ask them to send back the system, so I could take a closer look. After I got the system I figured out that it was the transmitter's problem, the transmitter was designed to say if the carrier falls on the ground, the man down transmitter will trigger the mini-pacc system. I found that when the clients don't return the device to its original state in this case the vertical stance, the Mini-pacc system does not recognize that the carrier has been rescued and stood back up. Therefore none of the other buttons will work afterwards, you need to return it to its original state and hear a beep from the Mini-pacc which means it has re-registered the transmitter. I tried this several times and the system works perfectly. I informed Peter and Tony of my solution to this problem. I also wrote a report on this matter to include in the user manual.

Working as an intern at WWSI has taught me how to manage people's relationships with your colleague, your supervisor, customers and potential partner. There are always tension between people and everyone has stress. It is important to put these emotions away when working as it can affect the effectiveness of a team. One example was when me and the other intern were put on to one project. The project involved setting up remote access from our office to Singapore. At first we shared our ideas and listened to each other's opinion. But we both had a different approach towards the method for this project. Tension started to build up, the discussion got intense and I stopped the discussion. I intended for both of us to cool down before we made any decisions. Clearly both of us were bringing unnecessary emotions to work. I found that at work it is wise to apologise first to your colleagues when tensions build. I could hold my ground and not talk but this is not the attitude when working together. This will only affect us on our potential to achieve results. I went forward and apologised to my colleague so we can start working on the project. .
Later down the track i had a tense moment with Peter and was not sure how to deal with it. Peter handed me a small project involving setting up a 3G router. The router was setup and ready to go. But I got carried away with TWIG programming and helping Karthick with ideas for a new project. I forgot the 3G router task Peter gave me. At the end of the day, Peter came down and spoke with me. He mentioned if i had finished the task and why didn't i report back to him. I told him I was carried away with other matters. He pulled over a chair and sat down with me. He told me that whenever someone gives you a task to complete, you always need to report back to them or at least let them know you have finished the task.
I felt stressed as Peter spoke with me about this matter when everyone was around. I did not know how to deal with the stress. It is a mistake i made, but i did not think it is such big deal. I listened to his suggestion and promised to change, Although i did not feel that way. Later when i consulted other colleagues and went home to reflect on this matter.
It appeared to me that I wasn't very responsible for my work and I did not show the respects I should have shown for my superior and my job. I started to question myself, I found that I have the tendency to either forget or just didn't care enough to report back to the person who gave me the task. It is a sign of respect for the other person and it shows that you are a mature and responsible person. I appreciated Peter bringing this to my attention, I decided to be more responsible for my work, friends and family in all aspects. Everyone has flaws and it is up to you to change and act upon that. I knew i need to start to change a little by little. My first step is to always report back to either my colleagues or superior when given a task or asked a favor. Next time when confronted by others about my work or issues about me I need to take it seriously and in a calm way. Review and reflect afterwards to improve.

After the conversation with Peter, I analyzed the reason why i did not report back. I wanted to change this as it is affecting my performance and reputation at work. I set a short term goal for myself, For every request made to me, i will get back to the person regarding the result. Even if there is no result, I will inform them of the progress. I started to realize good communication within the company and outside the company makes everything simpler. I have learned to think more in depth and analyses the reason behind different occurrences. It became a habit of mine to self-reflect. .
I have changed in two different ways. First was Peter's conversation with me, it made a great impact on me. From that day onwards whenever someone in the company gave me a job to complete, I always get back to them either face to face or via email. Especially for all the troubleshooting Tony passed on to me. When I finished a troubleshoot, no matter if Its resolved or not I always get back to him and explain to him the procedures I took in successfully solving the issue or I  suggest alternatives for him when the issue was solved. It builds your reputation with your customer and your colleagues.
The second change was when I used my previous skills in customer service within the current technical support role. At first I found it to be very difficult to maintain my multiple roles, setting up the Twigs, constructing the Mini-Paccs, all the projects handed to me and also being the technical support. When I got my first technical call, I was really nervous since I was not familiar with the products and therefore the lack in confidence when customers ask certain technical questions. This has been proven fatal when troubleshooting. If you don't understand or know what you are saying, you will not gain the customers understanding and trust. .
After a few embarrassing moments and awkward silences with the clients. I decided this cannot be the way I consult. I used my previous skills in customer service, bond with the customer, put myself in their shoes and always be patient and talk with a calm voice. But these only work on the foundation of solid knowledge of the product.  I decided to study all the equipment. I studied every detail of the device and what may go wrong with different parts within the device. I practiced with my friend, with him on the other side of the phone and me giving him instruction on how to tie his shoe lace. Sometimes it is hard to convey your ideas to the customer. I found this small interaction with my friend did help me to convey my ideas more clearly. .
I advanced my skills in technical support and learnt the process it takes to be good at something, always have a strong grasp of the fundamental knowledge and study it with patience. When I talked to Peter and Tony, they seem very pleased  as to how well I am going with the technical support role. I shared with them what I found to be my weaknesses and did eventually change that to my strength. .
From the past few weeks of troubleshooting I learned that:.
* Always be patient with the client.
* Always treat the customer as if they know nothing about the device, basically you cannot just tell the clients what your brain is thinking to do. You will need to change that to the form in which they can accept and understand. It's like two people speaking two different languages, there's no way they can understand each other. .
* When answering the phone, always start with a joyful voice. I found this was the customers are much easier to talk to rather than using a monotone or without emotions. .

Progress.
My knowledge for the equipments progressed and it occurred to me that my responsibility for my role is very important. Although i was excited about this internship and very keen to learn. I did not expect to be put under such pressure and even such responsibility. I need to be more cautious of what I do and be aware to double check every time for error. In the past I have had responsibility from my previous employments, but not ones that is this close related to what I do and what i can change. .
One error in programming the TWIG or one loose wire in the Mini-pacc can really determine one's life or death. I was surprised that University did not teach us about morals, responsibility for others and the impact of our actions as engineers. I came across articles about morals and ethics when studying in university, but it was just mainly text book knowledge. Within a few weeks at WWSI I learned more than a few years in university, it surprised me but also brought up my awareness that there is so much out there to learn and observe. I need to  step out of the box and achieve in the telecommunications field.
A incident occurred when I was preparing stock. An emergency alarm went off on Karthicks monitoring station. He hurried over and checked the system. He then disarmed the alarm and immediately turned around and start dialing the phone, he switched the phone on speaker so i can hear as well. After a few beeps I heard a frightened female voice from the other end. We knew she was in trouble. Karthick asked her what happened and she mumbled that she needs police. .
Karthick told me to speak to the lady to calm her down and he started calling the police department. By talking with the lady I found that this system is installed in a rehab facility and has been triggered by this lady because of a rehab patient went berserk in the facility. Not long after the police arrived on scene and we hang up as the alarm was disengaged by the police. I was thrilled to have experienced this so earlier on in my internship. It was exciting to know that our system responded very quickly and even prevented serious events from happening in the facility. I was shaken a little afterwards. This is exactly what I wanted to do as an engineer, to help people and make the world a better and safer place to live. It came to my mind, every time i slack off or make a mistake, it might be someone else paying the price. This incident changed the way i approached my work and life.


Learn From your Mistakes.
Everyone makes mistakes, the fact of making a mistake is not a big deal. But the way to handle these mistakes is the most important part. Do you let the mistake slip away hoping no one will find out or take action. It was the last few weeks of my internship at WWSI. I and the crew were busy compiling documentation and hardware for Double Bay project. I got called away with a different project. I was given 22 TWIGs to program and test. .
I programmed the TWIGS whilst others worked on Double Bay. I rushed the programming and testing. After I was done with the 22 TWIGS, i joined the team and started working on Double Bay. Then something twitched in my brain, I have forgotten to activate and test the GPS function of the TWIGS. I was frustrated because the TWIGS has already been shipped out. I struggled on what to do next. I wanted to tell Amjad who's responsible for the couriers. I knew if I told Amjad, then the product will need to be returned back to us straight away. The other option was to ignore what happened and get back to work. The GPS function allows rescue teams to locate the person in aid. No one would notice as the GPS will calibrate itself when turned on. But i know sometimes there are defective products and some GPS chips do not work. I knew I would be blamed and even more serious actions taken in place. No doubt it was my fault and mistake. By coincidence i looked back at one of my reflective journals which states that these devices are lifesaving equipment and someone could die without a working TWIG. .
I went to Amjad and my supervisor Karthick to reveal what has happened and hope to fix it. To my surprise Amjad and Karthick did not blame me. They told me that everyone makes mistakes, but what really matters is what you do next. Since I told Amjad about what happened rather than hiding it. We retrieved the TWIGS before it was shipped to the client. This allowed me to reflect on myself and remind myself that admitting your mistakes and fixing it is much better than just wish it never happened. In my future career and daily life, I will not hesitate to admit if I made a mistake and amend accordingly. .
Double Bay Project.
Peter have informed me on several occasions that material handling and recycling is one of the major factor our company look at when manufacturing. It is crucial to use highly recyclable material. One of the issues we look at is how materials we use affect Australia as a whole. Recycling can decrease the earth's emissions of CO2 and non-recyclable waste. Peter always suggests us to closely investigate into the material before purchase. .
When we were conducting the street tests at Double bay, we encountered a problem that required us as engineers to make the right decision for the Double bay Shopping area. We had to take in account the project in short term and also look into the future. The access points we used only work in line of sight ( but provides further distances and reliability of signal strength compared to the standard Access points). As we conducted tests, I noticed that two of the street's coverage was poor, signal strength is low and the link keeps dropping. The network would still work fine with these flaws but it will cause problems in the future when more shops are built or demands becomes high. In this case we need to bring in all the equipment, technician and road blocks to situate the access points on the lamp poles again. Since Double bay is a fast growing community. I raised this issue with Tony and Peter. My suggestion was to add an additional 2-3 access points to provide perfect coverage and for future consideration. It saves the community trouble and will benefit the area in the long run.
After I presented the flaws of the current system and benefits of adding extra access points they refused my suggestion. They said it would be too costly for the council and if they were to engage my idea, the current cost will be higher than what the council are willing to pay. I tried to convenience them saying that in the future my suggestion will turn out to be much more practical and less costly. I knew i had to provide some evidence to back my theory up. I conducted research around the double bay area. Calculating the current population growth and merchant growth. I conducted a separate heat map and signal calculation using the Ekuhau Software. I presented these information to Peter and Tony. They saw the issue and asked me to construct a report and present it to the Double Bay council. .
I felt really great after they accepted my idea. Hard work and going the extra length can really pay out and make the difference. After a few attempts at preceding my message and report to the council. They were not interested as it will raise the cost of the current project. It was disappointing when they refuse your idea, as you are trying to reduce their cost int he long run and benefit the area. Although i was not successful in changing the decisions. I felt i have done my part and tried to provide the best solution for the environment and the council. After this issue,  it seems like i have changed some of my perception and thinking when looking into problems. I tend to look at the problem in depth and consider the problem in an engineer's perception. .
Relationship with the company.
The structure of our company is very informal, work environment is very comfortable and relaxing provided you have finished your work. My company is a small to medium enterprise. In a small company, bonding between people is much more easily established and stronger. Among the engineers, no one acts like they are superior than you. I did have this in mind when I first came in the company, I don't know where I got the idea from but I thought as an intern, Your colleagues will tell you to do all sorts of stuff at their will e.g. making coffee, taking out the trash, shredding paperwork or even printing and photocopying. I believe it is the nature of the company, its size and the atmosphere that allowed me to bond with everyone in the company.
I know even if i leave this company after the internship, i will still be in contact with many of the engineers here. They helped me a lot when I first came to the company, treated me equally and shared with me every resource. We often arrange company lunches and dinners, in a way to help everyone to fit in the company. Our relationship progressed rapidly when we are not in the office. Especially Karthick, always helped me out, looking out for me, and educating me with different wireless products. I respect him very much as his not the type of person that don't want you to gain knowledge. I kept a good relationships with everyone in the company, helping them out whenever they need me. I always believed that in this world you will need to give, don't expect anything in return if you are not willing to give. .
In my future career, I will always remember to build good relationships with the people I work with. As you can really learn a lot from them and it will make your time at work much easier. It is very important for a person to fit in the company's culture and  environment. .
Part B.
Major Project.
Double bay project was the first major project that I was involved in. This project was proposed by Double bay council to provide free Wi-Fi access within the Double bay shopping area. Because there are a large number of coffee shops, shopping area and restaurants, the council gave strict coverage that needed to cover. This project was a pre-work that we need to succeed in for a few different other projects that the councils are willing to introduce us to. So it was important for us to make sure the WIFI signal will cover all the areas the council demands. Some of the other projects are the three levels of World Square located at Town hall, which needs to be WIFI covered as well. Another big project is the Anzac stadium which requires us to have WIFI coverage around the stadium, but the set up may be different from Double bay. Double Bay will be using access points to establish a mesh network (all within line of sight), the Anzac stadium will be using each access points to give offs its own network.
Karthick needed my assistance, since there will be a lot of testing and site surveying we need to complete before we can decide what access point to use and where to locate them. I was thrilled when Karthick came to me, as I have always wanted to work on something on a larger scale and learn more knowledge on my own profession. It wasn't my intention to only work on Mini-paccs and TWIGs during my internship. Finally this chance came and I know I would learn a lot and maybe prepare myself for future projects in other companies. Experience is very important in Australia when it comes to technical side of things. I need to grasp as much knowledge as I can. Me and Karthick went to Peter and told him Karthick needed me to assist him with the project. At first Peter was not sure, as I have been doing very well on my side and things might get busy and out of hand if I am not always in the office. I really wanted to work on this project, so after thinking about what I should do, I talked to Peter and told him I will finish every project given to me including any Mini-paccs or TWIGs. I also told him i will stay behind and do overtime if it is not done. Peter agreed after seeing how badly i want to work on this project.
The first site visit i went with Karthick was to establish the survey for the area, we used a software called Ekahau for the survey. First we entered the walls and windows of the building into the site surveying program. This way when we enter the parameter of the signal strength of the access points, we can obtain a better understanding of how the signal will travel and penetrate through these obstacles. After reviewing the site survey report with peter ,tony and the technician from Double bay council. We decided to place 9 slave access points on 9 different light poles and two root access point acting as the master. we need all the other access points to be in line of sight with each other connecting to the master access point. .
Me and Karthick were looking through the different range of access points Ruckus provides (we were in partnership with Ruckus, so we always get our access points from them). We finally decided to go with the 2270 industrial access point. This access point will establish a line of sight signal within a 300m range providing a strong signal. Also this access point has the ability to focus its signal strength in different directions called the smart beam. To simplify this, say if I was walking with my mobile device and getting Wi-Fi off of the access point. It will direct its signal beam with me when I walk from one place to another, this ensures that I have constant data rate and link when on the move. This was a new technology Ruckus developed. It made me think about what paths I want to take when i graduate, either telecommunication technician, go in to management or into researching of new innovation. I guess I still have a lot of time to think about this, but when the decision is made it will affect my life entirely or even others. I have always wanted to make a change to the world. I know it is hard but that's my goal and I know one day I will reach it with hard work and persiste.
Working Independently .
It was hard when everyone gives you all that responsibility when you are learning. It was during the first two months in the company that taught me to be a independent thinker and doer. I also found the power of collaboration. This is why it made me think about how I should be working in the industry as well as working with classmates at university. It is much more effective to have others contribute to the current idea, it collaborates a lot of different thoughts and perspectives towards the matter and you might learn things from your colleagues. .
I tend to work alone and solve issues by myself; it is effective in many ways. When there's so much people in a group it is harder to come up with a decision and that wastes lots of time when it comes to urgent matters and sometimes you will find that you are the only one in a situation and all you have is yourself, now you have to think independently and act on what you make of the situation. This is why I like to work alone; it is faster, more efficient, less complaining and more freedom. But from the past few months i have learn it is better to incorporate both these aspects into your daily university life and work. It is important to be able to work alone but also work with others and accept their point of view. I need to push and encourage myself to participate in more team work either for university assignment or at work. This internship has taught me that with good teams you will achieve great results. .
After Anthony left the company, I had to rely on myself. Although I can ask other engineers for help or guidance, I didn't do that there was a little ego in me that made me want to handle everything that comes my way. I found the Mini-paccs to be quite easy to construct and assemble. It was easy because I relied on the skills I acquired earlier on in university; I never thought that university study would contribute a lot to my understanding and acceptance to different work environment. Soldering was quite easy, since I had practiced many times in different subjects such as Introductory to Digital Systems and Data Aqusasition and Distribution. but in the field, it needed much more precision and accuracy as a fault or loose soldering point could affect the entire duress system. .
I made sure every bit of wire and circuit board I soldered is perfect and has a lower possibility in corroding and loosing contact. Some of the procedures i took was to make sure to have average soldering on every point, not so much that it blocks the transmission and not too less that it could break loose. I also applied a Rubber piping that is shrinkable under heat. This treatment is applied as I don't want any wires to come in contact with each other, a short circuit may occur and that would be a problem for a Duress alarm system. Whatever I work on or test I have made sure it works and is stable for use within extreme conditions. I also used a method called tinting, this uses soldering wire to solder a normal multithread wire. Then gently heat the lead and apply soldering wire to the lead, it will strengthen the wire when inserted into jacks and screw holes.
Learn, Reflect, Act.
Within the six month internship there were always times that were intense, frustrating, hardworking and nerve raking. I found it to be the most effective period in my internship. Wehn Peter constantly gives me small projects/tasks to complete and constantly pushing me to make new discoveries of what I know and what am I capable of. He taught me a broad range of aspects of my engineer career. One Instance is when Peter gave me a project on a device called Maestro Industrial 3G router, he asked me to test the device and make it operational. I knew there is devices where you can insert a Sim card and activate internet service with it, like the Telstra 4G wireless hotspot. But this device is classified as industrial standards.
So I applied what I always do when I come across a new equipment or situation. I call it Observe, Gather information, Think and Act. I first observe the router, looking at the outputs and inputs of the device have a general idea of what the device might be used for. Then I head on to gather information. I found the manual for the device and had a brief read through the manual. The think process is when I think about what the device can do, in what possible ways can I make it work and how do I test the device. Then I turn to Act where I start experimenting with the device, my past experience taught me that you should always prepare yourself when confronting a situation, reduce the risks to a minimum. The device was quite easy to configure, just change the APN name and password for the sim card. The router worked fine and I tested it with the desktop and my mobile phone. .
While later I got carried away with TWIG programming and helping Karthick with ideas for a new project. I forgot about the 3G router task Peter gave me. At the end of the day, Peter came down and spoke with me. He asked me did I finish testing the 3G router, I said yes. Then he asked me why I didn't report back to him about the task. I told him I was carried away with other matters, but this was no excuse. He pulled over a chair and sat down with me. He told me that whenever someone gives you a task to complete, you always need to report back to them or at least let them know you have finished the task.
 It appeared to me that I was not responsible for my work and I did not show the respects I should have shown for my superior and my job. I started to question myself, I found that I always have the tendency to either forget or just didn't care enough to inform the person who asked me to do something for them that I have finished and resolved the matter. It is a sign of respect for the other person when you do that and show that you are a mature and responsible person. I appreciated Peter bringing this to my attention; I have decided to be more responsible to my work, friends and family in all aspects. Everyone has flaws and it is up to you to change and act upon that. I knew when going back to work I will have to start to change a little by little.
My first step is to always report back to either my colleagues or superior when give a task or asked a favor. .
Learning From others.
Similar to what was mentioned in the earlier part of the report. I tend to be a more individual worker. I do learn a lot from my colleague and superior but I preferred to work alone as it provides me a sense of control and security. After spending 2-3 months in the company. My perspective towards how I should work has changed. I found working with others provides more diversity in the project. .
I have learnt many aspects of life and professional skills from both who I worked with and my superior. It is important to learn from others and advance yourself. One of the most important and useful knowledge I picked up when I participated in the Double bay project is management skills. I have also mentioned this in my report as this has really changed my perspective of engineering and my future path. I observed how Peter and Karthick managed the company and the project. The first thing I got in touch is working on a timeline for the Double bay project. I had to incorporate and consider all work schedule and delays that may take place. I formed a timeline of the project and the duration of each process, this was similar to what i did in University but I never have used it at work. I presented my work to Karthick, he did changes and showed me that some tasks may have a longer duration and how some tasks are able to be listed in parallel as they can be performed at the same time. I later discovered this is what I have learnt in Design Fundamentals and is called Concurrent engineering. I have forgotten about this until Karthick taught me. I now believe university knowledge will contribute to your work and career in the future. .
What I leant from Peter was more in depth and more professional. He handled the resources, both the engineers and products. After close observation I found that he has the tendency to know which engineer is more advanced in different task. He knew beforehand who can deliver and who may struggle. He also handled the relationship and emotions of colleagues. There are always tension and friction in a team that could affect the efficiency of the entire project. That's when peter's skills come in handy. He knows how to allocate different people with similar personality to the same group. Sometimes even different personality to drive the team. For example, he would place Karthick who has a much more motivated and fast paste work flow. Then he would have a few other engineers who were much more reliant and soft on the edges. Karthick in this team will motivate everyone and drive the team to meet deadlines. The more round edged personality members will have an effect on the details and provide a more careful analysis and insight on the project. .
Although Personal skills and professional skills are important in daily work. It is also important to have a sound knowledge and a set of technical skills for the future career. I have learnt many technical skills during the internship. Skills such as setting up a wireless network, performing technical troubleshoot over the phone, soldering, viewing auto cad files, doing street surveying with different software, checking other people's work. There are too much to be listed here. These are just a small portion of what I have learnt from my colleagues and superior.
I found I acquired these skills more in depth and much faster when working in a team or with a colleague. Everyone has different attributes and skills that I don't have. After learning and working with all my colleagues including the human resource, marketing and finance team. I believe that I still have much more to learn, what I know now even after the internship is not enough to prepare myself for future career. I need to seek more knowledge of my profession to be able to advance in the Telecommunications industry.
Professional Manner.
Double bay project has gone through 1/3 now. Karthick and I started to fix two access points on to movable poles that we carry around the site. He set up the Root access point with the ZoneFlex (Zone Flex controls and monitors all access point on the mesh network; the Root access point connects directly to the ZoneFlex with POE. Then all the other access points on the poles will be connected to the root access point wirelessly. This will create the mesh network and allow the ZoneFlex to control the network, monitoring each user's usage and time). I knew it's going to get really busy, so I applied my time management method I created earlier in my internship. I started to drill holes for the Mini-paccs and all the preparation for it, so whenever I have time, I can start connecting the wires. I also labeled all the parts needed for each Mini-pacc, so it's easier to find and assemble. Although I always gets stopped along the way for troubleshooting or Karthick needing help. As I have labeled and put every component in a neat and tidy environment, I will never lose track of where I up to am and therefore minimizing mistake but also have efficiency.
The first day at Double bay was disappointing, we took the root access point, zoneflex and the two access points on the movable poles and two batteries to connect to the movable access points. We then connected the batteries to the access point and wait for Karthick to establish the link between the access points; he will test the strength of the link and data rate. My access point was able to get established, but bad news came from the other access point. The battery connector became loose because of bad soldering, it was too bad that I was sick the day before and Karthick had to tell someone else to solder the Battery connectors. I had a look at the clip, the solder was not sticking onto the connector, and therefore the wires are loose. When I got back I took the soldering into my own hands. I took extra precautions when soldering the connectors; I had the soldering covering all the wires and the connector so it's hard to come loose. .
At the connector end I used some heat shrink piping, so when heat Is applied it will shrink and become stiff and hard after cooling. This process will make sure when the wires are accidentally pulled upon, it can with stand that force without any wires coming loose. From this incident I gathered that we should not let somebody do a critical job when you are not sure that their skills are capable of doing it. I will consider all possible outcomes or trouble, I will try to prevent that from happening. In this case we were delayed for the testing phase just because of a minor segment which everyone thought would be perfect. This is another factor that only happens in the real world, you always need to prepare fully and have different perspectives inspect on the matter. Since I have experienced this first hand, I will never make this mistake in the future whether I am working for someone else or having my own employees. We need to clearly identify the capabilities of different individual.
Importance of Responsibility.
During the internship I motivated myself a lot more than when I was studying at university. I worked very hard in university studying, learning all the theory and fundamentals of telecommunications engineering. I used these knowledge when working at WWSI. Below is some of the product that I was responsible of. .
Mini-Paccs: This system is a Duress Alarm where customers can trigger the system with a personal transmitter or a fixed button. This system then dials out calling the SOS contact list to establish acknowledgment for any incident occurred. This system requires me to assemble part by part. It consists of a Relay, 4 Channel Receiver, Siren/Strobe and a dialer. Building the system wasn't simple as different specification is given by the customer each time and it is up to me to design how to build and where each component goes. The important lesson I learn here is that data sheets, current models and guidelines are very important. Then comes the wiring of the relay to the receiver, siren/strobe and the dialer. This required me with lots of patience and accuracy. Lastly we would have to program the dialer with number and emergency messages provided by the customer. I took notes where ever I can and took photos in case I forget something later on. I knew this is a very important system that many people rely on. And what I do could easily determine ones situation. Because of this reason I took this system very seriously as I want the customer using this system to be safe when emergency occurs.
TWIG Protector: This is a device that has saved many lives. This device can be carried in the pocket just like a normal cell phone, but when emergency occurs customers can press a SOS button on the device to trigger an SOS cycle which calls all the numbers programmed in the device and it will send out SMS to all numbers. It will establish a call with the designated number to allow emergency live coverage. TWIG also has a man down alarm, which will trigger when the device is tilted in a specified angle. It also allows GPS tracking and monitoring. Some customers require us to monitor the Twigs in case of an emergency. Just like the Mini-paccs, I took very detailed summary of how to program. As these are lifesaving equipment i don't want any faults and errors to occur when an emergency has occurred. .
I have constructed around 30 Mini-Pacc and around 100 TWIG during my internship. As I developed my skills and understanding of these systems. Peter and Tony were satisfied that I was able to assemble these devices correctly and well within the time frame. Peter then gave me more devices to construct since the quality and quantity of my work was of very high standards. The less time I used to assemble these devices, the more units were able to be produced and sold. .
Change.
I never allow the concept of internship to restrict myself to perform and learn at a greater extent. I treated this internship as my real job, but with that it always come with greater responsibility. I have had many 'Jobs' along the way when studying at university; I know how hard it is to work at the place you don't like or the job that you don't think there is any future progress involved. But because we need jobs to survive and pay for fees, we always bear with the job we have. .
I have never considered the jobs I worked for before can be classified as my career, it is only something we do to obtain short term fulfillment. When I started working in WWSI, everything changed I notice the passion, the enthusiasm, the willingness to undertake difficult tasks and the extent I will go to seek for knowledge. There is not once so far that I have thought this is enough and slack off. I meet different engineers from every field that work together on a project, i learn the responsibility and ethics any engineer should have no matter what field they are involved in. This internship is the start of my career and i believe there is a long way for me to go to reach my goal.  It has changed my perspective of the engineering industry and i think when i get back to University to study, doing projects or attending lectures will have a better insight and views on these matters. It also will make much so sense as i have seen and participated many of the operations live. .
Not only has this internship changed my perspectives and views, it also had an impact on how I go about doing things. I have become more responsible for my work, i am able to handle large amounts of workload without messing up, focus on task with more precision, handle different situations with calm, analyze in depth when little information is given and much more organized than before. I really want to thank everyone in the company, as each and every one of them has contributed to making the person i am now. The constant pressure and reliance on me has made me grow and it will definitely give me a better edge in my future career in the telecommunication engineering industry. .
Experience .
There are many skills and personal attributes I learnt and improved on during this internship. I have advanced my management skills when conducting and performing task in all the projects and small projects. I learnt to manage myself, a team and also a project. Managing the time of each strand of activity and preparation in a project. This is similar to what we do in university. I will be applying this skill to my future studies and career. It will get the job done more efficiently and safe time and hassle. Managing myself which refers to time management. When I first started in the company and was given lots of tasks to complete, I struggled as I was not familiar with the product and was not able to perform well. I had to stay back a lot and finish all the task or even could not finish at all. That's when I looked in to my time management. I found a efficient was for myself to manage time, both using a physical white board and also the application on my phone to plan and remind me of different deadlines and progress. When I was studying at university, I found I also struggled with studies and work. I will apply my new time management skill to my university study to help me work and complete assignments more efficiently.

Future Plans.
As the internship is coming to an end. I gathered everything I learn during my internship and wanted to take notes so I will be able to use in my future career. The most important skills or perspective are all learnt during projects and performing tasks. This is when I started to apply what I learnt in university to the job, It was definitely not enough. That is how I started to learn more and more skills. Most of the skills in learnt in this internship will affect my university study and future career. .
I have learnt a lot of hands on skill, which was not able to be done in university. For example, in depth soldering, wireless network setup, equipment testing, procedure to take for OH&S in the workforce, How to communicate effectively with customer and troubleshoot and most importantly coding. Although not much coding was done during this internship, I still grasped the fundamental of what programming is like in the work force. As a Telecommunications engineer we do not need to program everything as all equipment and software has already been coded and tested to work. There were only minor changes such as the TWIG programming of different input data and the Ekuhau Surveying software which still requires a basic level of coding to be able to use and input settings. It is not essential but I believe having skills in programming and coding is very important and critical for future career. This has changed how I would take on University subject selection. My decision is to prepare myself all I can in university for my future careers. .
Communication over the phone and person to person to troubleshoot with customers is not only a personal skill. It also requires you to have a strong technical skill and good knowledge of your product and service to be able to troubleshoot and fix the problem. I have taken notes to remind myself in the future career learning your product and fundamental knowledge is important if taking on a technical support role. I have prepared my skills in wireless network setup and in depth soldering for my capstone project. It is important for me to propose an idea that is within the telecommunication scope and would apply what I learnt in this internship to both of my capstones, especially capstone B as we do require getting hands on and built a prototype. I believe the skills I learnt in my internship will contribute a significant portion of my capstone.
Working in WWSI has taught me a lot different aspects of the engineering field. It changed the path i wanted to take as an engineer. I always think that i only need to advance in my technical skills and i will be successful. But after this internship, it made me think really carefully about this decision. I need to have some management skills later on in my career if i want to progress either to a management role or to start up a company of my own. Managing the company does not mean controlling which directions the company will go; it also implies that you need to have good management skills over your staff. I will definitely look for an opportunity at university that will allow me to study management skills. Firstly I need to graduate from my current bachelor degree, then I will look for options to study management or even a financial course to give a better perspective of the different roles people play within a company. This is important because as an engineer, you will need to be able to communicate throughout the company with different sectors. Limiting me to a technical person is not something I look forward to for my long term goal.
Studying for a management course or subject is currently a long term goal. The short term goal is to mature my technical skills. After this first internship, I found that I was never as skilled as I thought myself to be. There are still so much to learn. One of the most urgent matters I have already taken into account is programming. Since I had some experience in C++ (coding language), I have already signed up to www.code.org for programming lessons. One other major aspect I came across during the internship was qualifications. It seemed that for a engineer, the more variety of product you know how to use the more likely you can get a better position. Some of the qualifications I looked into were Cisco and Ruckus. Both these companies provide professional training for their product and qualifications. I have taken interest in Ruckus which specializes in industrial and domestic access point and router. They have very innovative products such as the smart beam technology. .
Both Peter and Tony wanted me to stay in the company and work part time. They said I have done really well in the company and they wish I could train the new interns and help out whenever I can. I accepted the offer, since I need money for daily expenditure. But I know that I would not stay in this company for ever, as it will restrict my future career. In my next internship I wish I could learn a bit more on management skills and people to people skills.
