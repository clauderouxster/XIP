REFLECTION

My name is Viraaj Mehta and I am currently doing a bachelor's degree in ICT engineering at UTS. As a student in my penultimate year I knew I would have to take major steps towards my future career goals and the advice that I got from my colleagues and career services was to select professional engineering practise preparation (PEPP) subject as the first step. This subject is designed to be an industry preparation subject where students are encouraged throughout to conduct themselves as if they are already in a professional working environment.  I chose this subject and I would like to reflect back on some of key experiences that have contributed to my individual professional growth.

Teamwork.

 I thought I had done enough group projects to know all about teamwork but in fact was ignorant to know the difference between a team and a group. I was grouped into a team of students from different backgrounds and I had no idea if I would ever be able to interact with everyone. At first I had language barriers as the team could not understand my accent. Then we had no leader and no designed plan to achieve our project aims.  When I decided to take over the role of a leader to organise everything through Face book and assign individual tasks I was accused of being dominant over others and was given a low rating in our weekly assessment of each other. I decided to pull back and listen more, as I remembered one of the professional codes of conduct that I had agreed upon at the start of the semester. As a result the team realised this and gave me more opportunities to contribute especially in our final presentation were we were crowned as the winning team.   I realised that teamwork is not about individual strengths but all about your ability to cooperate , communicate, listen and share ideas while respecting other members of the team. I hope I will always remember this lesson.

Sustainability

I always had a vague idea about sustainability. Throughout this subject I was surprised to know that sustainability is a far more important and complex concept to understand and describe. Our trip to Sydney YHA was the first point where I got a brief idea about sustainability and was surprised to know that it considers social, ecological and economical aspects.   The social aspect of sustainability was never known to me and looking at the way Sydney YHA had preserved historical remains at their site I realised that social sustainability was not only related to social interactions and equity between people but also preservation of our culture and history for future generations. I was then told by Seb Crawford (Sustainability Coordinator at UTS) that sustainability is a continuous process; this made the concept clearer. We were then assigned a

team task to come up with a sustainable solution for UTS 2020.  I took the major task of convincing my team to consider the social aspecttoo while selecting a solution. I hope to be

able to incorporate this into my future projects as I now have a deeper understanding of this broad concept of sustainability.

Interview

What were your previous experiences of interviews? Have you had successful interviews in the past? How did you expect to perform in interviews? To assist me to improve my interview skills I had the help of interview stream an online tool.  The first time I used this I was very nervous even though I was recording my answers and was disappointed to see myself lacking confident if I could have been presenting to an employer. I then got some important interview tips from the lectures that followed on a few sample interviews and in order to prepare me for my first interview I went through online videos and researched on common behavioural interview questions. During the mock interview I was very nervous and could not control my pace or speak in a varied tone to be clearer and as a result I was very disappointed with myself that I could not perform to my potential. As a result I got marks that I felt were not what I could have achieved.   I also understood that interviews never give you a second chance and you have to give your best on the first opportunity that is provided to you. At the end I got some additional feedback especially on my initial formal dressing where I did not close my top shirt button. I wish to integrate my experience in future interviews I attend.

Sense of responsibility

 I always thought I was responsible enough to complete my tasks on time but I also knew that I had a habit of procrastinating. I faced the harsh reality of being irresponsible the day I failed to attend one of the sessions for PEPP where we had to submit a formal proposal for our project. I actually had an exam on the day at 6 pm and I asked my colleague if we had a class on the specified date. He replied that there was no class as it was tutorial week and I was quite t satisfied as I was busy with my exam preparation. As a result I received an email from my supervisor informing me of absenteeism on the day. I rushed back to uni, helped my other team mates to complete the proposal but it was too late as I had to face the wrath of my supervisor and my team mates.   I realised my mistake: as I was taught throughout the subject, as a professional I have to always look for a credible source which in my case was to email my supervisor. Being irresponsible for day cost me marks that could have added to my final assessment but I was happy as it was a different learning experience.   It was also one of the professional practise codes that I had agreed to abide by at all times. I now expect to act more responsibly and professionally in my future career to avoid such circumstances.

Focus on career

In the past three months I have learnt and experienced professional behaviour required at an Australian working environment. I have also learnt about various strategies necessary to have a successful career. It all started when I was told to fill out the first MPR (My Professional Readiness) form and I had no idea of my short term and long term goals.  I thought I was not ready for the professional environment but as I progressed and learnt about the Australian regulations (i.e. Workplace Health and Safety, Workplace diversity and equity, and Ethics) which was supported by learning the art of designing resumes and cover letters and job searching techniques my confidence improved.   When I was recently told to redo the MPR form and fill out a professional action plan (PAP) by my supervisor through some valuable tips I realised that I am now more focused towards my career goals. I am now able to fill out my short term and long term goals and I proudly consider myself as one of the competitive candidates for the career opportunities I target. I know this is just a first step and I also know that I have to keep learning throughout my career but I am anxious to take my next steps towards my career goals which include getting an internship and eventually a graduate role.
