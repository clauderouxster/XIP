Part A.
1.0 Introduction.
My first internship was completed at Central Milling in Cowra, NSW approximately 300km west of Sydney (Refer Figure 1), I commenced in July 2013 and finished in February 2014. The owner, Ben Casey, is a Cowra Local and a UTS Alumni studying Mechanical Engineering during the 90's. He was featured in the UTS Tower Magazine during my placement, he is a valuable knowledge source and I tried to learn as much as possible from him. We specialised in mineral size reduction for both the industrial and agricultural industries (Central Milling, 2014). We are a small to medium sized company with 10 full-time employees and 2 part-time staff members (Refer Appendix I for Organisation Chart).

P5.SO.2.A.1.

Our products have the ability to be spread through a water based application, aerial or directly injected into the existing irrigation system (Central Milling, 2014). The company has an established Undergraduate Internship Program with a one-week handover system so that the previous intern can teach the new intern some skills they will need during their placement at Central Milling. .
P5.SO.2.A.2.
I am originally from a rural community and I jumped at the chance to work in a rural environment because I knew I would acquire invaluable experience at a fast pace. In a rural setting there are less employees and less resources, this translates to less people doing more varied and diverse jobs. I was right in my assumption because my activities were constantly changing and were very challenging. I also prefer a country lifestyle as opposed to city, I enjoyed settling into the community and everyone tried their best to make me feel welcome.

1.1 Obtaining my internship.
It is common practice for most interns to secure their placements through people they know. EPP1 tells us to exhaust your network and you will find someone you know who is an Engineer, this tactic failed. Even after harassing the regular patrons at my casual hospitality job and applying to the minimal positions advertised on i2ms the whole process was becoming very stressful and unsuccessful.

P5.SO.2.A.3.
My new approach was to ring all my options every week and this persistence paid off; I secured my position in Cowra without an interview but rather a quick chat over the phone. The Managing Director helped me find a place to stay and even threw in a relocation allowance that bulked up my first pay. The main appeal to the position was that it was in a rural environment and the company had an established intern program, moreover, I just had a good feeling.
P5.SO.2.A.4.
In terms of further developing my job seeking skills, I am trying to increase my networking activities. I have applied for the Industry Sponsored Lucy Mentoring Program through UTS and I am trying to accommodate more events run by Engineering Australia, in particular those organised by the Young Engineers Australia, into my calendar.
P5.SO.2.A.5.
2.0 Initial Skill Set.
Before I started my internship I was rather confident in my capabilities because I have good results, always helped Dad tinkering about and have already completed a Bachelor of Business Administration at Macquarie University. Understanding how the entire company works grants a holistic overview of business operations and often allows me to understand the office procedures and processers. Working inside the office with paperwork and a computer is considered inside my comfort zone. Wanting a practical based internship was going to push my personal boundaries and broaden my skill set. .
My Dad is a cabinetmaker and I undertook Woodwork for my HSC so I have experience working with timber but I had never really worked with metal before. It sounds rather primitive that I expected to graduate as a Mechanical Engineer and have limited knowledge of how to work with and form metal.
My SolidWorks abilities were limited and needed development, this was definitely a weakness. I am very proficient in Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint and these skills definitely worked to my advantage.

T1.SO.10.1.
3.0 Important Activities and Projects.
Among other tasks there were 4 areas of focus throughout my internship. They include adaptation of an auger, mill expansion, development of the software program "I'm On It!" and improving existing components within production.

T1.SO.1.A.1.
3.1 Adaptation of Auger.
The first to focus on is my dedication to adapting an auger in order to improve the loading procedure of B-double tankers, refer Figure 2. Our customer is a mining company located in far north Queensland. They place an order for 36 tonne of Gypsum approximately once a month, it is then transported to the mining site and used, in tandem with other methods, to purify contaminated water before releasing it back into the environment. The Gypsum is milled into 36 bags, each weighing one tonne. Each bag is lifted, using the forklift, above the tanker while one person is harnessed on top of the tanker, assisting and guiding the flow of material. We only had one forklift with the lifting span to reach the desired height, using this method it took approximately 1 hour 40 minutes to load the truck. While this process takes place, the desired intent for the auger was to be filling the remaining tank simultaneously therefore cutting down the loading time.

T1.SO.1.A.2.

The main point I retained from this exercise was an increased appreciation for having excellent CAD skills. I spent 2-3 weeks drawing the auger in SolidWorks before I started designing any modifications (Refer Figure 3). What a mammoth task that turned out to be, partly due to the fact that the motor orientation changes when the top of the auger is re-adjusted higher or lower. The auger currently operated using a petrol motor, however, for our purposes we wanted to be able to use an electric motor when inside and petrol when outside. For ease of use, the design criteria specified that the same pulley belts must be used for both motors. I learnt how to equate petrol motor and electric motor specifications such that the two motors would have the same output as well as their respective pulley sizes needed. The first electric motor mount and tensioning system that I designed and made was not perfectly square and straight, I had used a piece of scrap material. Upon realising that vibrations, movement and accuracy were a major concern I was made remake the mount using new materials and with assistance from a colleague (Refer Figures 4, 5 and 6). As my first task it was very overwhelming and with my minimal practical experience I felt, at times, useless. The auger project carried on for quite some months, I would work on it when there were no other pressing jobs awaiting completion. .
T1.SO.1.A.3.







T1.SO.10.1.
3.2 Mill Expansion .
Another area of production I focussed on was expansion. We are a small to medium sized business growing at a fast rate, the infrastructure cannot always keep up with demand and thus part of my job requirements were to organise installation of 13 pre-made concrete walls, creating a further 6 outdoor storage bays for raw material. The wall dimensions were 6.1m x 2.4m and approximately 150mm in thickness. I firstly needed to mark out where the 14 holes needed to be bored, making use of a 3, 4, 5 triangle to ensure the two base lines were perpendicular to each other and to the existing Production Shed. The terrain was not completely flat, with aid from Laser Level Equipment I directed the 3 tradesmen where and how deep to bore the ?750mm@1m holes. Over the next few days we positioned all Channel and I-Beam posts into place, concreting them in place and shortly afterwards lifted all 13 walls into position; all with a tolerance of ?10mm. Refer to Figure 7, 8 and Appendix II for further plans and photos of construction.

T1.SO.1.A.4.


T1.SO.10.2.

T1.SO.1.A.5.

Through this experience I learned civil based skills, marking out boundaries and using Laser Level Equipment to assess the area of interest. Without exemplary organisational skills, including detailed planned drawings, ensuring all materials were ordered and prepared in a timely manner that coincided with the availability of the contractors. All these skills are transferable, I see refining my organisational and delegation skills as critical for a prosperous future. This exercise reflected development of Australian Engineering Standards Stage 2, Unit of Competence 4, Technical Proficiency, namely E12 and E14 in particular.
T1.SO.10.3.
The second area of mill expansion that I focussed on was designing, sourcing and installing additional drive-in Pallet Racking as well as moving existing arrays. To gather some idea of the project, the pallet racking stands 6.1m high and runs 11.5m along the floor, multiplied by 3 rows (refer Figure 9). All materials needed to be sourced, manufactured and installed in a logical order with precision and accuracy an essential. This racking has the potential to suspend up to 30 tonnes of product in the air and hence the width allowance for the pallets to sit on must be constant and exactly parallel. .
T1.SO.1.A.6.
The project involved higher order thinking; it consumed my thoughts for a month as I mentally constructed each step ahead of time. Thankfully, in my mind I went over and over the task multiple times. I was wondering why there were no compression tabs underneath the base to minimize material distortion and buckling. Taking this observation to the Mechanical Engineer, we decided they were a necessity. Thankfully we had not yet started to build on the bases so they were easily removed, a compression tab was welded underneath each supporting column and the bases were assisted back into position within 2 days (refer Figure 10).
When designing the bases and using the existing pallet racking as a reference, these compression tabs were not visible and hence I had no chance of including them in my drawing for production. I learned that you can't take something for granted or assume if you cannot see it with your own eyes. Refer Appendix III for further drawings and construction photos.
T1.SO.10.4.

3.3 "I'm On It!" .
Tailoring the maintenance software "I'm On It!" to suit our operation and equipment set up was one of my objectives to fulfil within my 6 month internship. The software was purchased from the USA and has more features than you will need; it is made to suit almost every business type. It was my responsibility to firstly, figure out how the program worked, than enter all components of our operation so that it replicated our production line. I then programmed the system to generate regular emails to staff members informing them of scheduled maintenance or servicing. Once the job was completed I would be notified and the job would become completed on the system and reset for the following scheduled date. The purpose of the software was to ensure the growing and expanding company didn't allow any piece of the production equipment to be overlooked, each part had a set inspection, service or maintenance reminder. These reminders range from scales' calibration due to vehicle registrations approaching their expiration date.

T1.SO.1.A.7.
I had no previous experience in tailoring a generic maintenance program from scratch, however, I do possess excellent planning skills and these helped me greatly with this task. Before inserting one piece of information into the program, I thought about the different categories, how they link into each other and how we can relate this to our company. There were three categories that "I'm On It!" used. Firstly "Classes", "Fixed Assets" then "Parts". Each providing a sub-category for the previous. Using a spreadsheet that encompassed four A3 pages I listed all 14 "Classes" that we created and their relevant "Fixed Assets" (refer Appendix IV). I critiqued the spreadsheet to eliminate all errors before entering a single item into the system; this process took approximately a week to formulate, from start to finish. When it came to finally inserting the data into the program, it became clear that my methodical and planned approach had paid off because there were no errors or desire to change any of the content I had entered. .
T1.SO.10.5.
3.4 Improving Existing Components within Production .
I have saved my greatest achievement until last, modification of production components. The backbone of the mill's ability to pulverise the raw material into a dust consistency are the 4 rollers (Refer Appendix V). They have an approximate diameter of 11" and are attached to 4 Journals, which bolt into the spinning Spider Clamp. The Journals attach to the Spider Clamp through Trunnion Blocks. Previously we would need to re-machine the wearing faces on both the Trunnion Blocks and Journal Heads every 12 months or so as they would wear unevenly, this would take substantial time because it needed to be outsourced. The mill would run on only 2 Journals while we fixed 2 and then the process reversed to fix the remaining 2 in production. My task was to simplify and condense this exercise. Working together with the other intern we worked on a design where all wearing faces were fitted with a wearing plate. The Trunnion Block wear plates would be attached with fasteners while the one to be fitted to the Journal Head would require a thin weld for attachment. We also modified the grease channels inside the Bronze Bush so that the grease would cover more surface area. Instead of a lengthy dragged out process it can now all be completed internally, providing the new shafts, bushes and wear plates have been ordered. I was very pleased with this final result because it will dramatically minimise down time. Refer Appendix V for extensive drawings and photos. Refer Figure 11.

T1.SO.1.A.8.

The material goes firstly through a Hammermill, this significantly reduces the initial size of the material to ender 20mm. The design of the hammers is such that they are made from Mild Steel and hard-face welded for additional strength. It would take approximately 2 weeks to make 16 new hammers ready for production. We decided to change the rectangular shape to a triangular shape so that we would be granted 3 wearing surfaces as apposed to 1. When one face wears, gravity will play a major part in always presenting the heaviest edge to the bottom and hence our hammers should theoretically last 3 times longer. We decided to draw up a SolidWorks representation of what we wanted, then a template was made and tested and finally my drawing was sent to a Chinese company who made 40 cast hammers for us. There was already a technical drawing of the grate design so they were also made by the Chinese company and sent over. Refer Figure 12 and Appendix V for further evidence.
T1.SO.1.A.9.

4.0 Professional Engineering Skills Enhancement.
My communication and documentation skills needed to be maintained at a high standard throughout my internship. My communication skills were strengthened by note taking at weekly meetings, instructing workers and ordering materials.
P2.SO.6.1.
4.1 Communication Skill Development .
Examples of my communication skills development are taken from the weekly meetings. At these meetings we addressed the agenda and checked on progression of projects as well as raised any new issues or changes in procedure. I would need to take notes on matters concerning my projects and make sure they were completed by the follow weeks meeting. It was common practice that the secretary would run the meeting, however, on occasion when she was absent this job fell into my hands. .

P2.SO.6.2.

Even though we were all native English speakers, all except for the other intern, there was communication difficulties between myself and the other workers. I diagnosed this issue to be a language barrier, while I come from a theoretical and well educated background, the majority of employees are practical minded and use industry jargon. Once we both spoke in simple terms, and with aid of free hand and CAD drawings, we would finally get our idea/concept across. As time went on this language barrier reduced in size and became nearly non-existent.
P2.SO.6.3.

Prior to becoming in possession of a book containing Standard Sizes of Steel, it would take me a substantial amount of time to order materials for a project. It was necessary to communicate with the supplier what I required and he would come back and forth with the applicable standard sizes and lengths of materials. Until I obtained this book, ordering was an exhausting and lengthy process. With some suppliers it was necessary to point out that I was the Engineering Intern, hearing a females voice they often assumed I was an office worker passing on messages and not the person who would be installing the fixture. I quickly learnt that excellent communication skills are vital and lived with my notebook in hand, documenting every little detail.
P2.SO.6.4.
4.2 Documentation Skills Strengthening .
This leads me to discussing my documentation skills during my interning stint. The most imperative tool was naturally my notebook, but I also developed documentation skills through invoicing and testing product samples.

P2.SO.6.5.
My poor notebook started out in crisp condition but ended up being held together with duct tape. I stuck to a rigorous schedule, writing down every detail from every day. My supervisor was a busy person, we would have lengthy discussions and come to conclusions on how to proceed. Having sketches in my book to clarify concepts and documenting an ordered method on how to attack a project allowed me the ability to work some what independently at times.
P2.SO.6.6.
Two other methods of documentation development was when I needed to invoice for deliveries or pick-up orders and also when testing product samples. Approximately once a week I would find myself having to test the colour brightness and salt content of 2 clay products. Having consistent documentation skills allowed me to deter a slight change in results. Using process of elimination, I detected that the testing machine was off calibration, we were able to notify the client of this misalignment and possibly protected the interest of an annual $1.5 million contract. Strong communication and documentation skills are the backbone of an efficient and successful working environment. There were times when mistakes were made because these channels broke down, they were costly and sometimes due to my misunderstanding or that of my colleagues. .
P2.SO.6.7.
5.0 Workplace Environment .
5.1 Workplace tensions .
As well as myself, there was another intern employed for the duration. He was not Australian and did not have a strong grasp on the English language. There was a circumstance when we needed to work together to redesign a component of the production process but due to cultural tensions and communication worries I became very stressed about the assignment. I went straight to my supervisor and explained that we were taking longer than expected due to certain difficulties and he understood my predicament. I was not the only worker who found him difficult to work with and understand, in future instances I was placed with another experienced colleague rather than with the other intern. .

P2.SO.9.1.

There were definitely cases when I was given tasks that were above my ability, these were set to challenge and test me to think creatively. On more than one occasion I needed to remind my colleagues and supervisor that I was an intern and not an actual Engineer, sometimes they were masked with the façade of a confident personality and assumed that I knew what I was doing, they were wrong and I told them so. This would cause minimal tension what would instantly dissolve. There were no prolonged tensions because I believe the best strategy is to nip it in the bud, I tried my best to disarm tensions as they arose.
P2.SO.9.2.
5.2 Ethics.
Ethics is a tricky subject because there is no black and white definition but rather a mass of grey area. My person ethical boundaries aligned with my employing company, hence, there were no instances when my personal ethical boundaries were approached.

P4.SO.5.1.
As professional engineers, we are sentenced with a duty of care to ensure the work we conduct is to a high standard and that we are not injuring the lives of others. On occasion we would perform work for other companies and we needed to ensure that we performed to a high standard. I will now go onto describe an example where my employer could have performed unethically but didn't.
P4.SO.5.2.
In the milling sector, every company has a different production set up that must be custom designed, rarely is anything component a 'buy off the shelf' item. Not all owners of milling companies are Mechanical Engineers and thus this opens a market for selling components that can be used across many companies. The first particle minimization process that takes place is for the material to pass through a hammermill. The material is hit with hammers until it can fall through the grates below, approximately 20mm in width. The design for these hammers has changed over time to attempt to achieve longevity and efficiency. Sitting down with the engineer, we redesigned the hammers' shape, to give them more working surface and hence hoping they would last longer. I produced CAD design, the workers then make a mild steel template and from there we denotes the design should work. The castings were then produced in China and the new hammers are now in production. .
P4.SO.5.3.
If the new design works well, we will go about selling the hammers to our competitors. This is a monopoly market, there are few, if any other players making this consumable, we have the ability to charge whatever we want. Instead of charging an astronomical price, we plan to mark up the product slightly and maintain a strong relationship with the competitor. It is obviously the most ethical move to make; we will still have a profit margin without taking advantage of someone who does not possess the same intellectual property. We wouldn't hand out our technical drawings but merely sell on the product as a finished, ready to use item.
P4.SO.5.4.
Knowing when you are behaving in an unethical manner is not an easy checklist of do's and don'ts, but rather a gut feeling. It was my responsibility to conduct EC Testing and Colourimeter testing of clay samples before the product is shipped out to the customer. These tests are usually conducted weekly and I share them role with the other intern. You could say that this task raised some ethical challenges, I am in a lab all by myself and left to conduct probably 20 or so test samples, sometimes taking around 2 hours. For the first 4 months there were no instances where there were any issues with results and I often wondered if anyone would know if I skipped a couple. Thankfully I religiously tested each and every one, even though boredom had sunk in. One day the test proved to be inconsistent and I had to stop production to remove the non-complying clay. The clay was to be sent to a ceramics company and if I had skipped that sample, the repercussions could have resulted in the pottery product not setting and hence could snowballed into loosing a valued client. There is always a place for ethics and I am grateful that I was never encouraged to cut corners and that in my workplace, unethical behaviour is no an option.
P4.SO.5.5.
5.3 Social Well-Being.
The basis of social well-being is the ability to interact within a community successfully throughout varied cultural contexts while also respecting ourselves and others (Washington State University 2012). Our workplace consists of predominantly Caucasian men who have grown up in the country, besides a few conflicts of ego, there are no real cultural conflicts occurring. Sustainability is a topic that I have more to talk about. Recycling is a huge part of our operation. We have designated recycling locations to separate paper and cardboard, plastic, aluminium, glass, mild steel and oil. The importance of recycling is always a topic of discussion at our weekly meetings and considered very important. Everyone pitches in and if we see an un-recycled item in the normal bin we usually sift through and retrieve the item. When all the bins are full we take them to the recycling station where we dispose of their contents free of charge. Not only is the system saving money it is contributing to a greener future.

P3.SO.11.1.
Central Milling offers many different and diversified services and products. We have an employee who performs tailored soil evaluations on properties and advices what minerals or composts to apply in order to improve their property and produce a richer, healthier crop and livestock. We supply stand-alone systems to incorporate fertilisers into the irrigation system, as well as our main operation of mineral reduction; milling clay, gypsum and other products down to a dust consistency. Looking at a long-term future, the company is extremely sustainable and its no wonder my employer, Ben Casey, received the Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2011 (Cowra Business Chamber, 2011). He completed his Mechanical Engineering degree at UTS nearly 20 years ago and has such foresight and vision for a sustainable, successful business.
P3.SO.11.2.
6.0 Elements of Competence .
My indicators of attainment are.
1. U1 Personal Commitments - E3 Responsibility for Engineering Activities -  a Consistently document work in a way that would enable another person of comparable ability to continue and complete your work should you be unable to do so due to circumstances beyond your control.
Evidence: Writing Manuals for Clay testing, writing instructions for "I'm On It!", writing out instructions including sketches and measurements for projects not yet completed when I finished my internship.
2. U2 Obligation to Community - E4 Develop Safe and Sustainable Solutions - b Take into account well-accepted standards of practice for design safety, while making the most economic use of financial, human effort, energy and material resources.
Evidence: Coordinating Pallet Racking installation, refer Appendix III for drawings photographs.
3. U3 Value in Workplace - E8 Communication - e Lead and sustain discussion with others and where appropriate, integrate their views to improve deliverables.
Evidence: Modification of the Auger used for loading B-Double Tankers with Gypsum, refer 3.1 Adaptation of Auger, page 7.
4. U4 Technical Proficiency - E13 Local Engineering Knowledge - d Keep yourself informed about new and emerging technologies, techniques, products, materials, methods, theories and science relevant to your practice areas.
Evidence: I subscribed to the "Bulk Handling" magazine, an Industry specific magazine which discussed breaking technologies as well as case studies and advertisement material. I would then discuss the articles with the Mechanical Engineer for clarity and more detail.

Part B.
7.0  Applying Theoretical Knowledge.
7.1 Developing SolidWorks Proficiency.
Throughout my internship there were numerous instances when my technical and theoretical knowledge background was utilised. While undergoing the subject "Introduction to Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering" we were introduced to using the program SolidWorks. Even thought this subject only granted me a little practice with SolidWorks, it was used as a stepping-stone to drawing technical and complicated components. Using the basic tools and methods learnt at University, I was able to construct and visualise production components with up to 30 parts and numerous assemblies within assemblies. During my internship I was granted the opportunity to build on my SolidWorks skills, there were also times when the other intern asked for my assistance with minor queries regarding the formatting of technical drawings. In my opinion, having strong SolidWorks skills is essential for my future career opportunities and I was lucky that I was given plenty of time to work on this particular skill.



T5.SO.8.1.




7.2 Applying Bending Moment Theories.
While undertaking the subject "Mechanics of Solids" last year, we were taught about bending moments and assessing various structures' stability. A colleague was working on the motor support for the Jaw Crusher. A Jaw Crusher is designed to be the initial product minimisation process, raw material is fed into the jaws and systematically crushed up against a hard surface, then passed through grates and onto the next minimisation process. While he was constructing this support he asked my opinion on the number of gussets he was using. The first things I looked for was whether they were spaced evenly underneath the platform, their material and was it thick enough to support the heavy motor and finally I assessed the about of gussets. I explained to the very experienced worker my thought process, using his extensive practical knowledge and my theoretical knowledge, we came to the conclusion that the four gussets he originally estimated would be sufficient and even over engineered. As weight minimization was not a factor in this instance and we had the material in stock we decided it would be better to over engineer the support platform. It was refreshing to see a practical application of what I had learned the previous year at University and it gave me insight into how the manufacturing side of the process works.

T5.SO.8.2.
7.3 Material Properties Explanation.
Another instance of when I applied my theoretical knowledge occurred when my colleagues either unintentionally hardened a metal or needed to harden a metal for a specific purpose. While a student enrolled in "Chemistry of Materials" we learnt about forming and working with materials including metals, polymers etc. My colleagues understood the practical application of making a metal red hot, them instantly cooling it in either water or oil would make it harder but they didn't understand why. I took a few moments to draw a few sketches and describe what happened to the material to make it harder and explained that when you harden a metal in that fashion, you also compromise its elasticity and hence make the material more brittle. It was an interesting lesson where we both shared our knowledge and together we encompassed a complete knowledge source. This instance of being the teacher was a rarity and I enjoyed sharing my technical knowledge. In the future when I think of material hardening I will remember the conversation I had with my colleague the practical experience will help the concepts remain clear in my mind over time.

T5.SO.8.3.
8.0 Experimental Learning Analysis - Kolb's Learning Cycle.
8.1 Kolb's Learning Cycle - Experience.
The workplace was very traditional in its gender roles, there was only one other female employee and she was responsible for the Administrative side of the business. I was the first female employee that was not hired for office work.

P1.SO.7.1.
8.2  Kolb's Learning Cycle - Think.
I wouldn't say the situation was bad, however, at the beginning it was limiting what they colleagues and supervisor thought of my abilities. The fact that I am a female is not something about myself that I cannot change nor it is obvious to hide or brush over. In terms of my performance capabilities, I did not have the physical strength to undertake some jobs but once my colleagues and supervisor saw me attempting to try I gained their respect. Coming from a University environment, I was used to being the only female in most of my tutorials and group work activities and the male students at University were also comfortable and used to working with a female. I thought about how to make myself 'one of the boys' but also contemplated at the same time whether I wanted that relationship with the colleagues as well. I am from rural NSW and as I was undertaking my internship in rural NSW I knew this issue would arise and hence decided that becoming 'one of the boys' and gaining their respect was necessary in order to succeed and learn the most out of the internship opportunity.

P1.SO.7.2.
8.3  Kolb's Learning Cycle - Change .
My fellow colleagues at UTS who were undertaking their internships were all male, I was unaware of another female undergoing her internship in the same semester as myself, hence I could not ask one of them for some advise or an opinion.
I discussed the situation with friends and family and I ultimately decided to gain the workers respect by working longer hours then necessary, working hard, and always being on top of my tasks. I would also attend social events on weekend, for instance, attend and support the local Rugby League and Rugby Union games. It was necessary to become an active member of my new community in order to succeed at work. .


I would also asked lots of questions and insisted that they stop and explain to me what was going on, this would take some time at first but later on would pay off because I acquired a thorough understanding of production and its diverse components.

P1.SO.7.3.
8.4  Kolb's Learning Cycle - Do.
The decision to try and become 'one of the boys' meant I spoke in a colloquial manner, wouldn't fuss but just jump in and get my hands dirty. It's a decision that payed off because within no time I think they forgot I was a female, on occasion when someone new would come into the workshop to borrow equipment they would get a shock to see a female, but in fact, I feel that in the long run I fit into the working environment and working culture better than the other male intern. My rural background is what I bonded with the workers about and they ended up having a high level of respect for my workmanship irrespective of my gender. There was still the occasional moment when I was restricted by my physical abilities, but this just became the new normal.

P1.SO.7.4.
9.0 Personal Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis.
Prior to the commencement of my internship, I thought I had a clear understanding of what my strengths and weaknesses were, however, during my internship, I discovered some strengths and weaknesses that I didn't know about while some weaknesses at the start ended as strengths in the end and vice versa. The table below depicts what I considered to be my strengths and weaknesses at the end of my internship.

P1.SO.3.1.
Strength.
Weakness.
Organisation and documentation skills.
Welding/Oxy/Metal Lathe.
Management of tasks and employees.
Physically challenging - both 40+degree weather and strength.
Assertiveness without being bossy/ proactive.
No forklift licence.
Ability to ask questions and not be shy about a topic I don't understand.
Sketching components and rough ideas.
SolidWorks (started as a weakness).
Sharpening tools.
Communication, both oral and written.

Industry jargon (started as a weakness).


Figure 13: List of my Strengths and Weaknesses.

As you can see from the above table, both SolidWorks and Industry jargon were initially weaknesses. Through practice and watching online tutorials, I was able to transfer SolidWorks into the strengths column. It took a lot of time and patience both inside and outside of working hours but I now feel proficient using SolidWorks to draw parts, construct assemblies and also produce technical drawings of parts and exploded assemblies. I would not have considered SolidWorks to be a personal strength up until the end of my internship.
Another weakness turned strength is my ability to keep up with technical terms and jargon. This was a tough obstacle to overcome but I overcame this in a few ways. I contacted the steel supplier and asked to have a book entailing standard sizes sent out for me to use, this covered angle, RHS, pipe etc. This way I could always have access to standard sizes and lengths. Around the workshop, I found that if I asked colleagues to draw a quick, simple sketch of what they were talking about that helped a lot, I then wrote to appropriate name alongside the sketch for future reference in my notebook.
When dealing with a weakness, my main strategy is practice, practice, practice; along with asking questions and not letting up until you understand. Using these basic tools I was able to transfer 2 weaknesses in 6 months and turn them into strengths. This tactic has worked for me in the past and has yet to fail me yet. As long as you're asking questions, you're learning.

I received a High Distinction for the subject "Manufacturing Engineering", I knew the internal workings of an Oxygen/Acetylene welder, I knew the theory of tapping and drilling holes and the difference in the types of grinders. However, I had never put it into practice. For the first month the sparks scared me, I got over this fear quite quickly, however, the Oxygen/Acetylene took a lot longer and it was only in my last few weeks I used it heat and form a 50mm strip of steel. Within one to two months I was confident using the grinder and other machinery. I found myself having a lot of 'aha moments' where by lots of internal linkages finally fell into place once I'd completed it not only theoretically but also practically.
I was blessed with the ability to try and fail. Although my work was monitored, if I made a mistake I was allowed the opportunity to evaluate my mistakes and fix them. I found this to be a great way to learn because I was given a chance to think about the manufacturing and assembly process, put it into practice, evaluate how I can improve and them finally end up with a final result that satisfies the initial job description. .
In terms of planning for my learning, I guess an example comes from the task of designing a working platform and ladder access for the 13-14 metre high Baghouse. Initially, I had no idea where to start, however, after days of reading the Australian Standards for Fixed Platforms, Walkways, Stairways and Ladders (CSBP 2013) I had specified the important sections directly relating to our needs.
The next step was to approach the Production Manager and ask his opinion on what functions he wanted the platform and ladder to perform. He was the most influential person on my decision, however, in passing I also asked my colleagues their opinions and advice for the platform and ladder as these people would be the ones using the structure.
I took some measurements of the existing silo and went about producing some sketches representing alternate ideas. Taking these to my supervisor he decided on the most appropriate and draw up a plan on SolidWorks. This project was put on hold as other more impertinent jobs arose, however, I have attached a list of the selection criteria for the person who continues the project after my term was finished.
Reflecting on planning my learning, I suppose I planned my learning by taking a systematic approach to the task at hand. On the very first day I was clueless as to the task, however, through research, talking with employees and asking questions I soon wrapped my head about the task and was able to produce numerous proposals that provided an efficient, cost effective and functional result.

10.0 Working Within a Team Environment.
10.1 Professional Reflection.
My part-time employment while at University is based in hospitality, fast paced and always run off your feet. It came as quite a shock to me to discover the more methodical and planned approach to tasks on my internship. At first I was constantly filled with a feeling of not achieving anything because the tasks took much longer than I was previously used to. Upon reflection I can see that preparation time of a task is as important, if not more important than the task itself. My colleagues taught me not to rush into anything and make sure I fully equipped and prepared for the task at hand. It was advise like this that made me learn a lot faster while working alongside others.
I felt pressured to cut my preparation time when there was an urgent job at hand. An example comes from when I given the task to organise, source and construct additional drive-in pallet racking. I was under some pressure from the Production Manager to get the task completed as soon as possible but on the other side of the coin, the job needed to be assembled properly otherwise it could result in catastrophe. I spent many days ensuring that the grounds were level, prepared all the materials and equipment, methodically checking I had all components ready for each stage. These were all tasks that I could undertake on my own, it was only at the last stage, when I was completely ready to start assembling was a worker allocated to me and under my supervision, we began to erect the mammoth task. Taking the necessary planning precautions allowed for a smooth period of construction with only minor oversights on my part. It was easy to work with my colleague because I was certain in my mind what needed to be done and hence delivered clear and succinct instructions.
A vital technique when working with others is to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. By knowing your colleagues on a personal level you can assess who to ask for advice for different tasks. There was a time when I needed to map out the 40 or so metres of mild steel blowline as we were ordering replacement blowline made from stainless steel. I made two jigs' to measure the angles of the blowline at turns. These needed to be very accurate as having just one degree of error would result in the new stainless steel blowline not accurately lining up into position. I sought assistance from a colleague who has no technical knowledge but exceptional practical experience. As it turns out he was the wrong person to approach and in the end I ended up making the jig's twice to compensate for my inaccuracies. Working with others can be a tricky minefield to navigate, however, once you have successfully evaluated their capabilities, time should make it easier when knowing whom to approach for different situations.

10.2 Technical Skills Analysis.
In order to gain the most from my experience, I devised a tactic to best aid my learning from others, I have listed the structure to my method below:.
1) Research - from the internet, asking colleagues or suppliers.
2) Watch a practical example or demonstration.
3) Take detailed notes or photos to help stimulate memory.
4) Attempt personally - under supervision.
5) Attempt on my own.
6) Seek evaluation and feedback.
The above method depicts how I best learnt throughout the duration of my internship. .
Another difficultly I experienced and felt that I overcame was realising that the way I did things were technically correct, however, different workplaces like you to do things differently. And although I may not have been doing something incorrectly, my workplace wished that I change my method because 'we do it like this' or 'we like to do it this way' were common phrases. I suppose different workplaces have their individual ways of making themselves more efficient and productive. .
Learning the right way to do things and the way that things are done at your place of employment are sometimes two completely different processes. Thankfully my workplace worked by the book and expected a high quality of work, so, hopefully I was taught the right way and not the quickest or cheapest way.

11.0 Strategies To Become Accepted Within the Workplace.
Fortunately I am from a rural community and grew up working for a small businesses and helping manage the small family business. Often in a rural setting it can be difficult to secure full-time employment that pays well. I knew that those working for a rural small business are very loyal to their employer and take the position very seriously, even if they are lower down the hierarchical ladder. .
In order to be accepted into the well-established workplace culture, I attempted to gain respect by always turning up 15-20 minutes early and staying at least 1 hour late. By demonstrating myself as a hard working employee I demonstrated commitment to the company and showed a strong work ethic. The men responded to this well and could see that although I didn't know everything I was trying to keep up.
Another strategy to gain respect and therefore be welcomed into the workplace was to try even though I knew I would not succeed. Again showing that I was attempting to improve myself granted others opportunities to help me and clarify concepts.
Also, from originating in a rural town, I understood that I needed to become an active member in the community in order to build a repour with colleagues, suppliers and town members. It is common for supplies and resources to be restricted in a rural setting and knowing people and having their respect can often get you a long way. I was an active supporter of the local Rugby League team, of which a colleagues son played in, I was involved in the preparations of a Cowra Small Business Chamber function and active at other social fundraising events.
From this experience at Central Milling I can now confirm that working within a rural setting is where I want to be in the future. I enjoyed the comradely and loyalty displayed by employees to the General Manager. Living in Sydney, in my opinion, can lack a sense of community, working within a tight knit of workers granted me a sense of belonging and I felt I was an active and valued member of the community. I would definitely work in an environment with mixed educational backgrounds again because it meant that practical experience was meshed with theoretical knowledge and we could both learn from each other.

12.0 Satisfied Australian Engineering Competency Standards Stage 2 (2012).
12.1 U1.E3.a.
Although my place of employment had employed interns in the past, there was no structured flow on of information to hand over to the next intern. Throughout the duration of my internship I was asked to create an intern resource that included things such as belt sizing, taper-lock and pulley sizes, bolt strengths, metric to imperial conversion charts etc. Basically, any resource I used I then saved into an "Undergraduate Resources" folder on the server as well as printing the most imperative information and posting it on the undergraduate pin board above our desk. .
I tailored the maintenance program "I'm On It!" to suit our specific needs, this was an extensive and lengthy process. For the convenience of the next intern, I produced a spreadsheet encompassing a copy of all the separate "Classes" and their respective "Fixed Assets". This spread sheet is available in Appendix IV for viewing and I printed a copy for the new intern when they started in order for them to help get their head around the program.
For one of our contracts we need to use a Colourimetre to ensure that the Oxide we added to the Clay was brightened to their standards. In order to sustain consensus between our results and that of our customers, we made a testing apparatus that we both use and sent this to the customer. If we both use the same method for testing than we should theoretically produce similar, if not the same results. To go along with the 5 piece apparatus, I needed to produce a set of testing instructions. Including photos and a step-by-step process for how to successfully test the clay. The replacement intern, as a reference, also used my instructions after I had left to ensure they were testing the clay correctly.
There were a couple of tasks that, due to time constraints, were not completed by the time I had finished my internship. Primarily, I needed to leave a set of plans for the rear External Storage Bays that I organised installation of as they have decided to add additional bays, refer to Appendix II for a copy of my dimensions. These for photocopied and filed away by the Maintenance Manager so that when it was time to add additional bays the appropriate measurements and calculations were readily available. Before I left I organised and primed all the materials needed, it was simply a matter of installation.
By writing instructions for fellow colleagues, I learnt that you need to explain every little detail because assumptions I might have made may not be made by the reader and vice-versa. I would normally write the plans, maybe leave them for a day and then look at the again. Also, I found it helpful to get an impartial judgement from someone who has had no input into the project to see if all the information needed was there on paper.

Within my first month or so I was given the enormous task of organising and erecting three more rows of drive-in pallet racking. The existing brand was a combination of Dexion MAK3 and MAK5. Throughout the yard we had lots of odds and ends of various brands and sizes of pallet racking. .
My first task was to conduct an inventory of all pallet racking in stock. Including their brand, length, span and quantity. This took a while and I was paranoid that I had missed some because it was scattered throughout the yard. I then had to calculate whether we had enough in stock, whether it was all the same sizes and brand, whether it was cost effective to use what we had.
As it turned out we had just enough if we joined them together so that they reached 6090mm in height. Ringing suppliers of Dexion pallet racking and determining how much it would cost to purchase joiners vs. buying all new pallet racking, we decided that the joiners would be the cheapest way to go. .
There were strict regulations and rules which state what cases you can use joiners and when you cannot. The join must occur more then two-thirds high of the total height and must be fixed with the correct fasteners and washers. From speaking to the representative from Dexion, I discovered that some joiners in the existing pallet racking were in fact the wrong ones. This was very alarming and the Dexion representative deemed our current use of joiners ill fit and hence I ordered additional joiners to compensate for the incorrect joiners currently in use. .




It was only through numerous discussions, many emails back and forth including attachment photos and sketches that I finally sourced all the components necessary to make the new pallet racking that I was to erect safe and up to the safety standard recommended by the supplier, Dexion. Refer to Appendix III for photos of the assembly and installation of the pallet racking as well the technical drawings needed to complete the project.

12.3 U3.E8.e.
In my very first week, it might have even been my first day, I was given the task to perform modifications on the auger used to load B-Double tanker trucks. I did not even know what an auger was at first. However, after research and talking with people I realised how it worked and the operation it performed.
The problem was that we shared ownership with a farmer who used it to transport grain during harvest and while we were using it the petrol motor failed. As we were using the auger when it failed, it was our responsibility to fix it. Using an auger to transport grain takes far less energy than using the same auger to transport milled gypsum. Before we replaced the old motor with a new petrol motor we were considering also adapting the auger to operate under an electric motor. Ideally, the electric motor would use the same belts at the petrol and have its own tensioning system. We primarily use the auger indoors, hence we would use the electric, while when it was used outside it would function using the petrol motor.
I spent some weeks drawing the functioning auger in SolidWorks, depicting where the new motor would sit in relation to the gearbox pulley. Then I calculated the equivalent electric motor capacity needed, found one in stock and calculated the pulley size necessary. Once I had collected these measurements I was able to "mate" in SolidWorks the electric motor pulley to be the same distance from the gearbox as the petrol motor, thereby discovering all possible fixture locations for the electric motor while hopefully using the same belts for both motors.
I was at a complete loss of what to do and where to start, however, I was constantly asking colleagues for their opinions, they would say a few ideas and I would return to the computer and research. This process went on for quite sometime. I would also inspect other motor tensioning systems that were used throughout the production process and try to think in my mind if they were applicable in this instance. I ended up with a motor mount design that successfully tensioned the electric motor and was independent of the separate petrol motor tensioning system. In the end though, the farmer who joint owned the auger took it for an extended period of time and although I had affixed the electric motor mount, the electric motor was not permanently affixed as the company ended up purchasing a telehandler that could perform the same operation in a shorted amount of time. Refer to Section 3.1 for a further explanation of the auger modification assignment. .

My employer was very interested in staying updated in emerging technologies and asked me to research 3D printers for prototyping purposes. The issue arose when I was drawing up the design for the new "Triangular Hammer" (refer Appendix V for drawings). We were changing the shape of this production component significantly and hence we wanted to make a prototype prior to getting casting moulds manufactured in China. If we had a 3D printer, I could have had a prototype within the day, however, as the prototype was to be made by a maintenance team member, there was a lag time and the accuracy of the prototype was compromised due to it being made by hand. .
After days of researching the different types and contacting University friends who I knew had researched the topic in the past, I expressed all the differentiating features into one Excel spread sheet. In the end, we didn't end up purchasing one because their prices are significantly decreasing and there are a few patents that expire within the next year or two which will also cause a steady decline in prices. Even though we never purchased a 3D printer, the research was very useful and broadened my product knowledge.
My employer subscribed to many industry magazines, namely "Bulk Handling Review", issued every 2 months. It entailed methods and industry improvements for handling bulk material. The advertisement material was also very informative and I would often look up items outside of work hours. The case studies were also helpful and it was very intriguing to note that a company who makes chocolate biscuits uses the same mixing and blending process for their biscuit crème as we do when we mix Oxide and Clay for one of our customers. It was great to discuss the variances that this biscuit company used to our production process, we would chat at length the entire procedure and he would always ensure that I understood. Understanding a concept is not something you can fake your way through, if I didn't understand I would keep asking questions and keep asking for a different explanation until it completely sank in. This of cause payed off in the long run because I was able to envisage future projects and production adaptations.
The above mentioned industry magazine was very expensive, however, I felt it very helpful and beneficial to stay in touch with the industry news and updates. When I contacted the company and explained I was a student wanting to subscribe to their services, they instantly cut the price in half. As well as this subscription, I am also on their mailing list so constantly keep updated with breaking news and events within the bulk-handling sector.

13.0 Encorporating Leasons Learnt Into Future Employment.
13.1 Reflection on student, professional and individual learning.
Insightful reflection on my constant learning throughout my internship at Central Milling can be analysed within three categories:.
* Student: I can already see that my attitude towards University has changed. I know think about problems differently and approach their complexity from a practical standpoint. In my "Machine Dynamics" class a few weeks ago a problem arose where two cogs were at a 45 degree angle, this they transferred the direction of power by 90 degrees. During my internship, while I was conducting modifications to the auger, it was necessary to take the gearbox apart, check the teeth cogs, realign and put back together. None of my peers in class understood the question, however, because I had experienced the problem practically during my internship I was able to explain the concept to my peers and completely understand the question.
* Professional: The terms 'Duty of Care' really started to mean something during my internship because I was involved in projects where you had a responsibility to produce a safe assembly. I needed to refer to safety standards produced by government bodies when designing a new platform and ladder access for an internal baghouse. I developed my professional learning by preparing the company for an audit from a customer. During these preparations I was instructed to write training manuals and Safety Operating Procedure's for fire evacuation plans, mill services and the operation of machinery just to name a few. Through part-time employment I had attended numerous information sessions personally but it was very interesting to be on the other side writing up the training manuals and instructions. The audit went very well and I'd like to think I played an active part in this result, the company is now about to sign a multi-million dollar contract for a constant supply of Gypsum.
* Individual: In the past, I have been known to become overwhelmed when granted numerous large tasks at once. Naturally there were times when I felt overwhelmed with the tasks at hand and I am very proud of myself that I learned how to speak up for myself and remind my colleagues that I was an intern, as I felt they would sometimes forget this fact. Because I am older than previous interns, am very sure of myself and speak my mind, my colleagues often assumed I had more experience than I actually did. I reduced my workload and pointed out that I would prefer to get 2 jobs completed properly than stretch myself thin and complete 5 tasks half heartedly. The ability to delegate tasks to the respective people and manage lots of tasks at once has influenced my studies in a positive manner because I feel more in control this semester being back at University. .

13.2 Future plans for my student, professional and individual activities.
Again I will choose to focus on my future plans in relation to three aspects:.
* Student: I have a much better knowledge base to attack University class problems and now think of things differently. I tend to now approach tasks holistically, thinking of how it would be made, through to its uses and what challenges I might face, as apposed to previously when I narrowly considered the one problem presented only. I know that I am a visual and tactile learner, when trying to understand future concepts at University; I will try to approach it practically. If I can somehow built a tactile and visual representation of the problem I will, because I know that learning this way will make the concept imprinted in my brain for an extended period of time.
* Professional: I feel that mentoring is a component lacking in my previous internship, I was constantly demanding time to be spent on my questions and was rarely approached. I will insist on a more structured mentoring program when applying for my next internship and also graduate program. Gaining a forklift licence is something I wish to achieve as well as attend a welding course at TAFE. My dream is to be sent to a conference where I can network with others who hold similar interests. I have subscribed to the Engineers Australia newsletter and will try to attend events through this portal. I am also looking to apply for a 12-week summer vacation program to broaden my knowledge base and hopefully expand my knowledge to a different industry besides milling.
* Individual: This year I hope to join the UTS Motorsports team as a method for continuing my practical knowledge base. Also, I feel the ability to assess people's character and quickly assess their capabilities is an excellent skill to master as a future leader. This year I have many group assignments at University and I will try to master this technique of reading people and assessing their capabilities quickly in order t cut down on time wasting.

14.0 Future Endeavours - My Next Internship.
There are many areas of myself that I want to improve upon and I am constantly re-evaluating my progress towards me goals. From a technical stand-point I need to improve my soft skills. Examples include SolidWorks, even though I am rather confident I know that I still have a long way to go before I am an expert. My practical skills also need attention, welding for example is a concept that I completely understand the theoretical side of things, however, lack the ability to transform this into a practical application. My technical language is another area of focus. I can effectively communicate the technical language related to the milling industry, however, on my next internship I want to explore a different industry and will thus need to acquire the necessary technical language specific to that industry. .
Long-term, I want to be situated in a rural setting. I can see that I need to expand my knowledge of farming machinery and techniques if I am hoping to break into this market. I also feel that the more practical and diverse experience I can attain will assist with my hopes of working in the mining sector. Any tips on transferable knowledge that will also relate to the mining industry will be a massive benefit in getting my to my goal. .
As mentioned, I hope to be working in a rural environment or in the mining industry. I am aware that the mining industry desires that you have the relevant certificates and licences. I hope to attain my white card, safe working at heights and confined space tickets. As these can be expensive, I hope that a company will invest themselves in me and send me to these applicable training courses.
My future professional aspirations for my next internship also involve development of my soft skills. I hope to gain more experience in report writing and formal presentation skills. As my first internship did not have a corporate or formal component I hope that my next internship will allow me the opportunity to expand my professional development. I am currently developing these skills in my own time as I am an active member of the SWIEIT (Sydney Women in Engineering and IT) speakers program at UTS. This program involves travelling to High Schools, both rurally and within Sydney, presenting interesting talks regarding Engineering and try to inspire women to apply.
I also see that attending a conference would be excellent for my future professional development, but again these are costly and I hope that my future place of employment will invest time and money into my future.

Reflection.
Being taken to my limit and challenged constantly has kept this internship very interesting and has kept me on my toes. Majority of the time I have been given ample time to complete tasks that would take other members of staff a fraction of the time it took me. Thankfully my employer understands that everyone has to start somewhere. I am grateful for the practical component that this internship has offered as I feel I have achieved a greater knowledge of just simply 'how things work'. I constantly ask questions and very member of staff will usually take a few moments to explain and answer my questions, normally expanding on them as well. I feel I have left my mark on Central Milling and will keep in contact with my employer for hope of future prospects. .
