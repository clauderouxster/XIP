scheme.public.pdf contains the metonymy annotation scheme as used by
the annotators. It is much more detailed than the category description
in the guidelines and also include guidelines for the initial removal
of e.g. homonym samples.. It should not be necessary for participants
to read these guidelines but they are included for completeness.
