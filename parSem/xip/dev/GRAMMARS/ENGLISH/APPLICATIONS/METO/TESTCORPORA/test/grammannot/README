The files countries.test.grammannot and companies.test.grammannot contain human annotation of dependency-like relations
for the annotated, possibly metonymic name.

The annotation follows the guidelines in scheme.grammar.pdf in this directory. 



#######################FORMAT#####################

The format used corresponds to the format used in the training data and is:

samplenumber|lemma|name|grammatical role|reading

where 

--- lemma corresponds to the lemma that our annotated name is related to.
--- name is the annotated name
--- grammatical role is the grammatical role that relates lemma and name (for example, subj, obj)
--- reading is replaced by unknown for the test data.


Thus, for example for the phrase: 

<sample id="samp343536"> 
Iran denies that it possesses nuclear weapons.
</sample>

an entry

samp343536|deny|Iran|subj|unknown

is created.




All samples have at least one entry: Should no
grammatical relations have been identified, then an entry with lemma NONE and relation nohead was created. 
If there are several dependency relations for one name, each of them is an entry
on a separate line.
