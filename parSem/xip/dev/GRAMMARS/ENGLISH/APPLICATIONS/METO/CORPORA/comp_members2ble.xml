This is the conclusion of an in-depth Wall Street Journal investigation which suggests that its moves may have served to bolster its results on a short-term basis and push problems into the future. 
The paper says that former IBM chief outside auditor Donald Chandler of Price Waterhouse & Co wrote in a 1988 memo that IBM was reporting revenues that it might never realise by booking sales when products were shipped -- to its own warehouses for onward staging to customers, or to dealers who could return them. 
The report said for over 10 years, <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-members" notes="OFF"> IBM </org></annot> has been booking immediately all the revenues from some long-term computer leases, getting a residual value guarantee from Merrill Lynch & Co to bring the total of the lease payments plus the residual value up to the 90% of the sale price that accountants regard as prudent for a sales-type lease. 
From 1984, the company also started extending more of the costs of new factories and other investments into future accounting periods -- in the belief that the mainframe business would pick up again and justify the move.

In a Commons statement on Nov. 30, 1989, Nicholas Ridley, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, said that the government took the view that the concessions were consistent with the terms of EC approval and that these arrangements were the least which were necessary to secure the successful transfer of the Rover Group to the private sector. 
The Labour Party spokesperson on trade and industry on Dec. 7, 1989, published letters leaked to him which principally disclosed that Lord Young of Graffham, Trade and Industry Secretary at the time of the Rover sale, had offered to BAe chairman Roland Smith a variety of means by which both the government and <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-members"> BAe </org></annot> could avoid parliamentary and EC scrutiny, relating to the date on which the purchase price of Rover would be paid.

CONCEIVED with high expectations in 1954, the B-70 Valkyrie was produced to give the USAF's Strategic Air Command (SAC) a long range, high altitude Mach 3+ heavy bomber with the primary aim of delivering H-Bombs deep inside the Soviet Union. 
The USAF's speed and altitude requirements were eventually met by the Los Angeles Division of North American Aviation (NAA) -- but not without first overcoming tremendous technical, design and manufacturing problems. 
Early studies took the form of a competition between <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-members"> Boeing </org></annot> and NAA which resulted in two grossly overweight designs. 
A second study followed with NAA making use of a little-known Top Secret paper published in 1954 on compression lift, in which two National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aerodynamicists -- A J Eggers and C A Syverston -- correctly theorized that supersonic shockwaves could be used to partially support an aircraft during supersonic flight.

One of the most striking features of IBM's lamentable personal computer business is that there is not a single reason embedded in the hardware why IBM mainframe and AS/400 users should buy their personal computers from IBM rather than from its army of tormentors led by Compaq Computer Corp: presumably few customers have actually asked <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-members"> IBM </org></annot> for 3270 and 5250 emulation in ROM on the motherboard at no extra charge in its PS/2s -- or perhaps IBM thought that would kill off its dumb tube business and resisted until it was too late -- now it makes no money on personal computers and sells few dumb tubes. 
The most daunting problem facing Louis Gerstner is that as yet he has absolutely no idea just how much he doesn't know -- and he will be Superman if in six months he has more than scratched the surface on that problem.

NEC says its new focus on the business market instead of the scientific and engineering market is down to the 36% growth in the latter market.

The operating software is available in modular fashion, with Encina having been selected for the transaction processing software, on the basis of its position as the de-facto transaction processing standard, as NEC sees it. 
NEC says its new focus on the business market instead of the scientific and engineering market is down to the 36% growth in the latter market. 
Last year NEC shipped 14,200 of the EWS4800 workstations, which was 120% up on normal sales for the previous year -- excluding an extraordinary order for 6,000 units from <annotorg> Daiwa Securities </annotorg> carried over from the 1991-92 fiscal year -- and anticipates growth to 20,000 shipments this financial year -- growth which is stable in value terms, according to NEC. 
This time NEC used a US industrial design firm, Ideo Inc, for design of the exterior of the products, but denies that this presages any move to sales of the workstations in overseas markets.

The reason for this new boom would be, wait for it, upgradeability! 
The idea was that a 486 user would rush out to buy a new processor for her or his machine as they became available and this facility would mean the death of the 386. 
Incidentally it would also reduce competition from other 386 processor Manufacturers, an event that <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-members"> Intel </org></annot> would doubtless find to their liking. 
I have to admit that I was cynical about the whole idea, most people do not like the idea of opening up their machine, let alone replacing the processor, however this opinion changed as the next speaker started.
