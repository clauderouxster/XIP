Yet in essence what she said was always the same. 
" I say that because the true liberation of women will never come about until proper respect and value is placed upon their role as nurturers. " 
Mrs Travers and Mrs Patel had shown flair for public relations from the beginning; and the beginning for them had been shortly after the famed conversation in <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-facility"> Sainsbury's </org></annot>, when they organised a summer procession in honour of family values in a South London borough particularly hard hit by both government spending cuts and feminists insisting that " family values " were a euphemism for women doing the housework. 
When she wasn't explaining that she and the libbers were on the same side really, Mrs Travers took pains to point out that FAMILY had no quarrel with the poor or socially inadequate; it was just that she wanted to pay tribute to the unsung millions of women (and men) who lived normal lives, did not swap roles, get divorces or abortions, become homeless or batter their children (or their wives); people who faced misfortune with re­sourcefulness and courage and without recourse to public funds.

For around £20 each we enjoyed the simple pleasures of being able to dance the Gay Gordons round a bonfire at midnight, vomit into a loch instead of on to a pavement, and stumble up hills for the remainder of the week walking off hangovers.

Moving on to to Mr Curtis, I don't want to dwell and re re er restate the the difference I had with Mr Curtis this morning, but again he did start a little bit of a red herring running by talking about the major commitment for retailing facilities, er there is a major commitment for retailing facilities in Greater York, er a degree of all provision. 
But the level of all provision of course is in terms of comparison goods, and in terms of large shopping malls. 
Erm now I I don't think anybody's suggesting that in er the Greater York new settlement we would be likely to achieve a large shopping mall anchored at both ends, one by <annot><org reading="metonymic" metotype="organisation-for-facility"> Marks and Spencers </org></annot> er and the other by Fenwicks, or or or any o or bins or any other department store, so he must really understand the process and really what we talking about er er in North Yorkshire.

Back upstairs, Paul Davies and his third-year colleagues, Patrick Quigley (history) and Geoff Smith (English) were in despair over their finances.

" I can't sleep at night because I'm worried: both about getting behind with my work, and about bouncing cheques, " he said.
