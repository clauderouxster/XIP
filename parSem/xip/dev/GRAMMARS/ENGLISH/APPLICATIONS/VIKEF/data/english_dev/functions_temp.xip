Functions:


LIXO, // For testing purposes only
PRODUCT, // Testing only
MOD,
ASL,
DETD,	// dependency between a determiner and a nominal head
QUANTD, // dependency between a quantifier and a nominal head
ADJMOD, // dependency between an adjectival head and an adverb within the AP (very nice)
QUANTMOD, // dep. between a quantifier and an adverb (e.g. about 35 million)
ADVMOD, // Dependency between an adverb and another adverb that modifies it (e.g. very slowly)
NMOD,   // dependency between two nominal heads. 
COMPOUND, // link between tokens that build a complex linguistic form e.g. have got
//VLINK, 	// link between an auxiliary and a non finite verbal form - CHANGER DE SENS
VDOMAIN, //links the first and the last element of a complex verbal form - RELATION OUTIL
	// Different features on this dependency
SUBJ, // syntactic subject
NUCL, // EX> Subject complement i.e. complement of a copula - Nucleus. Can have the following features : particle, subjcompl, padjunct, vlink
//PADJUNCT, // Predicative Adjunct (terminology of Quirk & al.) that is adjuncts of a copula
SUBJ-N, // semantic subject eg. in "John is playing" SUBJ-N dependency between playing and John
VMOD, // a very general dependency created in an intermediate stage that links a verb with something which is either an argument or a modifier. Different features on this dependency
VARG, // Verb argument that is neither an IOBJ, nor an OBJ
SUBJATTR, // dependency between the subject and the subject complement of a copula. This dependency is deduced from the SUBJ/2 and SUBJCOMPL/2 dependency.
OBJ, // Dependency between a verb and its direct object.
IOBJ, // Dep. between a verb and its indirect object
AGENT, // Dependency between a verb and an agent complement (passive forms)
NCOORD, // Coordination between nominal heads. The arity of this dependency is not fixed and depends on the number of coordinated nodes.
AJCOORD, // Coordination between adjectival heads
VCOORD, // Coordination of verbs
COORD, // Auxiliary predicate for coordination
QUANTCOORD, // When a coordinated expression is introduced by both, there is a QUANTCOORD link betwee the COORDINATION Conjunction and BOTH. 
VERBPREP, // Link between a verb and a preposition that introduces a PP argument or a PP modifier of this verb
PREPD, // Link between the preposition (first argument) and nominal head of a PP
//PARTIC, // Link between a verb and a particle, does not existe anymore (NUCL, relation)
CLOBJ, // Clausal object. Links a verb of a object complement clause (introduced or not by a conj or compl) with the verb which introduces the complement clause
CONNECTOR, // Link between a conjunction or complementizer introducing an embedded clause, with the main verb of this embedded clause. Features on this dependency complthat:+ for completives introduced by that, subord:+ for other embedded sentences. Note that the CONNECTOR link links a conjunction that has no grammatical function within the embedded clause (i.e. relative pronouns are not connector.
MAIN, // One-argument dependency. Marks the main verb of the whole sentence
PARTICLE, // Dependency that links a 's genitive to the modifier 
OBJCOMPL, // links an adjective, or noun to a verb e.g. it makes the girl happy ( OBJCOMPL(makes,happy) )
COMPAR, // links and "than" to the second part of the comparison
SUPPORT, // links a support verb and a noun supported by it
IPP, // for biotip only
ATTRIBUT, // for biotip only
