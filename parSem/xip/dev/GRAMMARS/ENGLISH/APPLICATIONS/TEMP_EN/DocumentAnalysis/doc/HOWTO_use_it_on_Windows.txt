This was never really tested, but:

in $HOME/parSem/xip/dev/GRAMMARS/ENGLISH/APPLICATIONS/TEMP_EN

there is a build.xml

If you want all (including XIP jar) to be integrated into the same
JAR file. just type "ant".

If you don't want this, type "ant jarMin". In this case, you need to add
jXipPy.jar in the classpath when running the application. Then, you can
choose the appropriate jar depending on your OS (Linux, Windows...).

A sample of how you can run easily Windows or Linux jar is given in 
autocal.sh (see Caroline H.), the application for automatic calendar
detection from e-mails.
