DependencyRules:

// Call these rules at the right point to ensure correct detection of 
// the main verb.

// Rule 1: corrects erroneous embedding (rule 2444 in paraph.xip embeds a main verb under a subordinate verb)
// This was to fix the following problem...
// If an extracted subordinate clause headed by a previously marked indirect speech main verb (MAIN),
// itself with an embedded clause, is followed by a sentence-final clause headed
// by a main verb of indirect speech [indspeech:+] (also MAIN)
// then this final verb is the main verb of the sentence.
// e.g. John said Paul came, Mary stated. "stated" is the main verb.
//      John said Paul came, stated Mary. "stated" is the main verb.
if ( (^MAIN(#1) & MAIN(#2)) & EMBED(#1,#2) )
~

// Corrects wrong embedding. If a verb is embedded under a verb other than the main verb, 
// it cannot also be embedded under the main verb
// But we need to know which one to delete. This could benefit from levels.
// The man who lives next door tried to greet John. *EMBED(lives,greet)
if ( EMBED(#1_lives,#2_tried) & EMBED(#3_greet,#2_tried) & MAIN(#2_tried) & ^EMBED(#1_lives,#3_greet) )
~

// corrects MAIN verb detection when the verb in a subordinate clause is chosen
// e.g. Although he ensures things stay at the top, John imitates Paul. *MAIN(stays), MAIN(imitates)
if ( ^MAIN(#1) & CONNECTOR(#1,#2[start]) )
