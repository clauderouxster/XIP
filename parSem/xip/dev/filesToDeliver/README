
This README file explains how to install and run XIP on a SUN/Solaris, a Linux system or a Windows platform.

XIP is avalaible on the following platforms:
--------------------------------------------
	- Linux Fedora (32 or 64 bits)   
	- Windows (32 and 64 bits)    

installation:
-------------
Unzip the XIP package (xip_V.R.zip, where V is the Version number and R is the Release number) in the directory
	(Let's call it <YYY>) where you want to install XIP. 
This will create the xip_V.R directory (let's call it <XXX>) in the <YYY> directory.

This directory contains some sub directories:
	 bin: contains the binaries and scripts for Linux, Solaris and Windows platform
	 doc: contains the documentation.
	 grammar: contains subdirectory for each language covered by the XIP license.
		 These language directories contain the linguistic data for the given language.
		 Linguistic data consist of: lexical and normalizing
		 finite-state transducers (FSTs) for tokenization and morphological analysis, HMM models for POS disambiguation,
		 and XIP grammars for syntactic parsing.
	 lib: contains the libraries Linux, Solaris and windows platform
	 include: contains the include files to use the c++ API. 
	 java: contains jar files to provide the XIP API from a java application.
	 sample: contains some examples of how to use XIP (script shell, C++ or java API, grammar extension)

The first thing to do is to copy the grammar file[s] sent to you by Email with this delivery,
 to the directory specified in the Email.

installation and usage on WINDOWS platform:
---------------------------------
If you get an error message on windows platform when you launch xip, the Visual C++ Redistributable Package
 must be used to deploy release versions of Visual C++ libraries.
The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package installs runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries required to run applications
 developed with Visual C++ on a computer that does not have Visual C++ installed.
- for windows 32bits:
	you have to run the  Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package (x86) (xxx/bin/windows/vcredist_x86.exe) on the target computer.
- for windows 64bits:
	you have to run the  Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64) (xxx/bin/windows64/vcredist_x64.exe) on the target computer.
	more information:http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=BD512D9E-43C8-4655-81BF-9350143D5867&displaylang=en

If you want to use the XIP library in your own C++ application you have to take care about the following points:
- on x86 platform you have to use Visual Studio 8 
- on amd64 platform you have to use Visual Studio 10.0



IMPORTANT NOTE about Linux platform:
------------------------------------
If there is a problem with glibc(kernel library) you may have to set the following environment variable:
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1 before using xip to avoid the following error message:
symbol errno, version GLIBC_2.0 not defined in file libc.so.6
For more information about this workaround: https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2004-November/msg00992.html


You can run XIP by invoking:
---------------------------
	XXX/bin/linux/xip (or XXX\bin\windows\xip)

Please read the XIP documentation to learn how to use XIP.

To get some information about the options of the xip command line, run xip without any parameter.

A small shell script called 'xipparse' is provided as example: XXX/bin/linux/xipparse 
 or XXX/bin/windows/xipparse.bat.
This command can read the text to parse from the standard input and outputs the results to the standard output.
Before using it, you have to update this file to:
	- initialize XIP_HOME with the xip installation directory

	- take in account of the grammar files used. Update the following lines to the grammar
	 directory provided in our delivery:
	GRMFILE=XXX/grammar/english/entity/gram_gen_entit.grm

In order to run the parser , type:

	echo "this is a test" |XXX/bin/linux/xipparse

You can also specify the text to parse with the '-text' option:

	XXX/bin/linux/xipparse -text myfile

To use an other grammar:
-----------------------
To use an other grammar, you have to update GRMFILE variables in the scripts provided as example.
Example in the case you want to use the french grammar in the directory XXX/grammar/french:
	GRMFILE=XXX/grammar/french/french.grm

Python:
-------
Xip provide an interface to transparently execute python scripts (only available on Linux and windows platform).
To get more information about this feature, see the Xip_scripting documentation.
To use python in your scripts you have to use "xips" binaries:  bin/linux/xips  or bin/windows/xips and about the 
libraries lib/linux/sharedLibPy/libxips.so, lib/linux/staticLibPy/libxips.a, lib/windows/sharedLibPy/xips.dll or 
lib/windows/staticLibPy/xips.lib. 
You have to install python 2.6.4 on your platform.

XIP and Java:
-------------
We provided also a java API for XIP. See the sample/java directory to found information to use it.
This java API can be used on the following platform: Linux Red Hat, Windows, Solaris, macOs
By default use XXX/java/dist/jxip.jar. If you want to use python scripting in a java application use in this case XXX/java/dist/jxipPy.jar.
To use this API, JDK 1.6 or greater must be installed on your platform.
If you want to use this java API with a older JDK version, you have to use Retrotranslator.
It is a Java bytecode transformer that translates Java classes compiled with JDK1.6 or 1.5  into classes that can be run on JVM 1.4.
It is a free, open-source tool based on the ASM bytecode manipulation framework:  http://retrotranslator.sourceforge.net/.

The xip-ui :
------------
We provide an IDE to provide some support to grammar development.
Before using this GUI, you have to read the documentation: xxx/gui/README and xxx/gui/gui.html.
You have also to install python on your platform.
To use this GUI, JDK 1.6 or greater must be installed on your platform.
To launch the GUI you can use the script "gui" on unix platform or "gui.bat" on windows platform.
