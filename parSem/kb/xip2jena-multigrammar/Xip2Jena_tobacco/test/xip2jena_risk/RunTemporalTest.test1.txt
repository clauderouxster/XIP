Kahlo was born *Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón* in her parents' house in Coyoacán, which at the time was a small town on the outskirts of Mexico City. Her father was a painter and photographer of German-Jewish background, whose family originated from Oradea, Romania.

Following a crippling traffic accident in 1925, Kahlo turned her attention from a medical career to painting. Drawing on her personal experiences, her works are often shocking in their stark portrayal of pain and the harsh lives of women. Fifty-five of her 143 paintings are self-portraits that incorporate personal symbolism complete with graphic anatomical references. She was also influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, aspects of which she portrayed in bright colors, with a mixture of realism and symbolism.

Her paintings attracted the attention of the artist Diego Rivera, whom she later married, divorced, and re-married. An active Communist supporter, she allegedly had an affair with Leon Trotsky, who was assassinated at his home in Mexico City by agents of Stalin in 1940. After Trotsky's death, Frida denounced him and became a Stalinist/Anti-Revisionist, calling Mao's China "the new socialist hope". Her home was decorated with lots of Socialist Art, including the faces of Marx, Engels, Stalin, and Mao.

She most probably committed suicide on July 13, 1954. Her ashes are placed in a
pre-Columbian urn which are on display in her former home "La Casa Azul" in Coyoacán, which has been turned into a museum containing a number of her works.

A biographical documentary containing archival footage, entitled "Frida Kahlo", was released in 1982, in Germany. In 1984 director Paul Le Duc released the film "Frida, naturaleza viva", which stars Ofelia Medina as Frida Kahlo. In 2002, released a motion picture titled "Frida", starring Salma Hayek in the title role.

Kahlo was noted for her unconventional appearance, including pronounced eyebrows and a thin moustache which she did not remove.
