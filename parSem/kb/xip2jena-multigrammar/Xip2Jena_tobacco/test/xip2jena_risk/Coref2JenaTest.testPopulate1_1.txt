IAEA Director-General Mohammad ElBaradei releases a report outlining the implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The report provides a summary of past resolutions, findings as of November 2004, developments since November 2004, the current overall assessment, and suspension. Director ElBaradei states that Iran has made "good progress" in correcting breaches, but there are still two important issues that need to be resolved in order to provide assurance that there are no undeclared enrichment activities in Iran: "the origin of LEU and HEU particle contamination found at various locations in Iran; and the extent of Iran's efforts to import, manufacture and use centrifuges of both the P-1 and P-2 designs." Based on current information, it appears the origin of the HEU contamination is mostly of foreign origin. However, a definitive conclusion with respect to all of the contamination, particularly the LEU contamination can not be determined at this time. "With respect to the second issue -- the P-1 and P-2 centrifuge programmes -- the Agency has not yet been able to verify the correctness and completeness of Iran's statements concerning those programmes. No additional information or documentation has been provided with respect to Iran's statement that it did not pursue any work on the P-2 design between 1995 and 2002," ElBaradei adds.
