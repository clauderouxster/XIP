Evgenii Mikerin, head of the FuelCycle and Nuclear Weapons Production Facilities Directorate at Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, says that the USopposition to the Russian-Iranian reactor deal stems from a desire to secure the Iranian market for itself. In support of his argument, Mikerin points to US intercession in NorthKorea, which resulted in the cancellation of a previously existing Russian-North Korean reactor deal. Mikerin stresses the particular importance of the Iranian deal as a means to keep Russian nuclear scientists, designers, and equipment manufacturers employed. According to Mikerin, Russia hopes to provide Iran with additional reactors and a complete fuel cycle in the future. According to Mikerin, Russia is to provide Iran with reactor fuel and reprocessing services, but Iran must accept the return of reprocessed materials,including waste products. The United States is threatening to terminate "certain bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements"and block Russian participation in the G-7 industrial forum unless Russia abandons the Bushehr deal. The United States is also warning Moscow that the deal could jeopardize current negotiations aimed at reaching a "broad nuclear cooperation agreement" for the creation of joint ventures to finance new Russian reactors. The cooperation agreement could also lead to the sale of up to $100 million in Russian nuclear equipment in the United States. Mikerin says that Russia would not work toward the implementation of disarmament agreements until the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission firmly settles issues surrounding the Iran deal. Once this has been achieved, Mikerin expects"an upswing in disarmament activities."
A report by Omid Suresrafil in the Tehran Times decries US proliferation hypocrisy as symbolic of its attempt to divert attention from its own nuclear stockpiles. Suresrafil elaborates that the United States has turned a blind-eye towards its main ally in the Middle East, Israel, regarding its nuclear stockpile. The reports further condemns the efforts of William Perry, US Defense Secretary, who was told by an unnamed Israeli military official on a trip to the Middle East in January that Iran could be capable of developing a nuclear weapon in five years. This anonymous source hinted at the possibility that Israel may repeat its action against Iraq in 1981 and attack suspected Iranian nuclear facilities.
Evgeny Primakov, the head of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, states that, "Russia has helped and will help build the nuclear power plant in Bushehr." He also adds, "We are delivering reactors of the type the United States want to deliver to North Korea. We are working under supervision of IAEA. We exclude in our cooperation with Iran all the actions that might lead to the creation of the weapons of mass destruction."
Experts from Russia and China arrive in Tehran to work on Iran's civilian nuclear program, which the United States believes constitutes an effort to build weapons of mass destruction.
Experts in the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry say they doubt China is supplying Iran with uranium-enriching centrifuges. [Note: See 24 September 1995 entry for a report of China supplying Iran with uranium-enriching centrifuges.] Russian officials insist that the Chinese do not have the technology to build the centrifuges. Russia exported first-generation centrifuges to China several decades ago. In 1993, Russia agreed to build a centrifuge plant in China to enrich uranium for use in a nuclear power plant. Under the term of this contract, China is not allowed to export the centrifuges to a third country or to use it to produce materials for nuclear weapons.
F. Dawlatabadi, the head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's department for the CIS and Caucasus, says that Iran and Russia are considering a plan to expand their cooperation in nuclear power engineering. Dawlatabadi says that the cooperation between the two countries is peaceful and both sides are working on a new phase of cooperation with regard to construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Factory officials at a beryllium plant in Ustkamenogorsk, Kazakhstan, say that an Iranian delegation had visited the plant in August 1992 but deny that any sale took place. The British Broadcasting Corporation reports, however, that the Iranians purchased beryllium, a key component in nuclear weapons production, as well as 100 tons of uranium on that occasion.
Fayruz Hassini, Iran's representative at the United Nations in Vienna, denies allegations that Iran has stopped cooperating with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. He says that Iran was among the first signatory countries. [Note: See 19 and 26 March 2002.]
Fernando Petrella, vice foreign minister of Argentina, says that so far,Argentina has stopped legal action by the government of Iran against Argentina over the breach of an $18 million contract for the sale of nuclear technology to Iran. [Note: See entries February1992; 2 March 1992; 1 October 1992; 22 September 1992.]
First Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi inaugurates the Nuclear Medical Research Center at Karaj. The center is located northwest of Tehran near an Air Force base and large military industrial complex, and it is staffed with Chinese and Russian technicians according to Western intelligence. This center is supposed to be civilian nuclear facility devoted to nuclear medicine and agriculture. A cyclotron accelerator from Belgium's Ion Beam Applications has been installed at the site. [Note: See 1991 and February 1992 entries.]
Five days of talks yield an agreement on the UN resolution originally drafted by Britain, France and Germany. The resolution, passed today, makes no threat of UN Security Council referral, a fact welcomed by Iran. The final compromise text applauds "Iran's offer of cooperation and openness" but "strongly deplores" its past obfuscation efforts, in addition to warning against "further serious Iranian failures."
Focus calls Iran, as a country, the most active proliferate r of weapons of mass destruction in the world. Focus reports that the Iranian civil nuclear program is comprehensive, which could possibly lead it to make nuclear weapons. Iran's pledges that its nuclear program is peaceful are countered by Western intelligence sources stating that Iran is actively seeking to acquire "gas-ultra-centrifuges" that can be used for nuclear weapons production.
A report from the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry reveals that Russia will provide fuel to the Bushehr nuclear plant for the duration of its operation.
Following a ceremony, workers began laying the foundations of the steam power generator at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The work is first "executive move" by the Russian in building the plant following lengthy studies, surveys, and examinations, says Asadollah Saburi, the deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. He says 3,000 cubic meters of cement will be used in the foundations, which will be built by an Iranian engineering company under Russian supervision.
Following a meeting with International AEA Director General Hans Blix, Iran refuses to allow environmental monitoring of its declared nuclear facilities under Part I of the IAEA's 92+3 enhanced safeguards program. According to diplomatic sources, Iranian representatives at the IAEA General Conference were concerned that environmental samples from Iranian sites could be given to the United States and other "foes." The samples would be taken to detect nuclear activities at Iran's safeguarded facilities. However, deputy director general for safeguards, Bruno Pellaud, said samples sent to laboratories abroad would be kept anonymous. Pellaud added that any country conducting sample analyses would be prohibited from conducting analysis beyond the 93+2 guidelines.
Following a series of Jerusalem Post articles saying that Iran acquired nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union, two US Congressmen, Jim Saxton and Bill McCollum, say that they have closely followed Iran's military programs and that Iran "has obtained nuclear weapons as well as established a ballistic missile command-and-control system to launch them." They have called on the Clinton administration to form a new policy on Iran, in light of its nuclear weapons capability. The Congressmen's statements conflict with what the Defense and State departments allege about Iran's nuclear program. Saxton is chairman of the House Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, and McCollum is a former member of the task-force. Both say they have been receiving reliable information for years "that Iran has been obtaining nuclear weapon's parts and supplies from the former Soviet republics and Central Asia." McCollum says that Iran's policy indicates that "it already has nuclear weapons and is now trying to acquire a delivery system to launch them." McCollum supports his claims by citing the acquisition of ballistic missiles and the establishment and exercising of a distinct national-level command and control system as examples of Iran's capabilities.
Following closed hearings with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Chairman of the Russian State Duma International Affairs Committee Vladimir Lukin says any undesirable aspects of the nuclear deal with Iran are because the "Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom), while negotiating with Iran on the sale of light water nuclear reactors, did not consult either with the President or with the Government of Russia. As a result, it looked as if we signed the deal on behalf of Russia, though in fact it was signed on behalf of a specific ministry....I would like Minatom to sell as much of its products as possible, but so that our grandchildren don't have a group of nuclear states around Russian borders." According to an anonymous Duma member, Kozyrev says the deal for the centrifuge was secret outside of Minatom and was not known to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. [Note: See 8 May 1995 entry for an indication that US Secretary of State Warren Christopher believed Yeltsin did not know of the deal.]
Following reports disclosing that Iran is building additional nuclear plants in Arak and Natanz, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi rejects the allegations that Iran is concealing the building of these additional sites. He says, "The Islamic Republic of Iran's activities in this field are totally transparent, clear, and peaceful and there is no secret and obscure point on the launch of these (plants) in the future....[B]asically there is no possibility of concealing such centers." Mr. Kharrazi explains, "Iran wanted the two centers to generate part of its electricity needs....[B]y the next 20 years, Iran has to produce 6,000 megawatts of electricity by nuclear plants and the launch of these two centers are aimed to produce necessary fuel for these plants."IAEA director Dr. Mohamed El Baradei says that he learned of these facilities six months ago, three months before the Iranians officially notified him. He states, "The Iranians told me we could not visit the sites as planned this week because President Mohammad Khatami would be out of the country and 'they need some time to prepare'."White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, however, expresses concerns about the Arak and Natanz facilities, emphasizes that these facilities reinforce increasing US concerns about Tehran's "across-the-board pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile capabilities." He adds, "Our assessment, when we look at Iran, is that there is no economic gain for a country rich in oil and gas, like Iran, to build costly indigenous nuclear fuel cycle facilities... Iran flares off more gas every year than the equivalent power it hopes to produce with these reactors."
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi says since Iran does not intend to produce nuclear weapons, the uranium enrichment program will continue and there is nothing other countries can do to stop them.
Foreign Minister Kharazzi declares that nuclear fuels for sale were not actually currently available, although Iran certainly had the "capacity and the potential." He also confirms that Iran is in the midst of a research program for the development of a new centrifuge. Iran is being criticized for working within an apparently narrow definition of what it means when it suggests it has suspended its uranium enrichment program.
Foreign Minister Kharazzi discusses Iran's cooperation with the IAEA and the EU with the representative of the current EU presidency, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini. Kharrazi says that the IAEA report proved Iran's lack of a nuclear program and that Iran had been transparent in its dealings with the agency, adding that with its recent decisions to sign the additional protocol and suspend uranium enrichment, it was now up to Europe to fulfill its part of the agreement. Frattini commends Iran's recent positive steps, which have encouraged the EU to cooperate with Iran and "lobby for its nuclear program."
Foreign Minister Kharrazi suggests that the IAEA withdraw the Iranian dossier from the agenda of the Board of Governors meeting in September.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi announces Iranian acknowledgment of the European offer to replace plans for a heavy water reactor, but rejects the offer citing Iranian ambitions to become a major nuclear fuel supplier in the next 15 years.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi announces Iranian appreciation for the European offer to replace plans for a heavy water reactor but rejects it, citing Iranian ambitions to become a major nuclear fuel supplier in the next 15 years.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamidreza Asefi states that IAEA concerns are "purely procedural" and described the polonium research project as a "misunderstanding" that would soon be resolved. Asefi explained that the polonium research project was undertaken 13 years ago.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mahmud Mohammadi calls on India and Pakistan to "stop immediately their atomic tests and the nuclear arms race and to sign the international conventions on banning nuclear tests."
Foreign Report reports that North Korea is supplying Iran with nuclear know-how, technology, equipment, and materials such as enriched uranium.
Foreign Report reports that Russia and Iran are negotiating a "nuclear powered desalination plant" as part of the complex at Bushehr. The project, included in the January 1995 Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation agreement, would be the first of its kind outside of the former Soviet Union. Officials from the two countries have discussed the Russian APWS-40 desalination system and BN-350 reactor, produced by Russia's OKMB Mechanical Engineering.
A report in the Israeli daily Haaretz by analyst Danny Keshem alleges that the Czech firm Skoda Plzen is providing Westinghouse of the United States and Siemens of Germany with access to the Iranian nuclear market, thus violating "the restrictions imposed by their home countries on trade with Iran." Skoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec calls the report "misleading" and says that except for limited cooperation on a very specific set of products for nuclear power plants, Skoda has virtually no other connection with Westinghouse. Hudec adds that Skoda is involved in talks with Siemens, but only pertaining to joint production of turbines.
Foreign Report reports that the Israeli Mossad estimates that as many as 10,000 Russians are helping Iran's unconventional weapons programs. The journal also reports that Israeli officials believe Russian scientists may have smuggled a supercomputer into Iran that could aid a nuclear weapon program.
Former chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix questions the claim that Iran was engaged in developing nuclear weapons, saying there was no "direct evidence" of this. He adds that Iran's civilian reactors were not, in and of themselves, a worry.
Former Iranian envoy to the IAEA Ali Akbar Salehi, cites significant progress in Iran's ability to use nuclear technology for agricultural, medical, and especially power generation purposes.
Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is preparing for a June 17th presidential election, affirms that Iran is "determined to have all branches of nuclear technology, including uranium enrichment...at any cost."
Former Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says "Iran is not seeking to arm itself with non-conventional weapons." [Note: See 14 December 2001 for a statement by Rafsanjani regarding nuclear arms.]
Former Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says that Iran has regularly paid its contribution to International Atomic Energy Agency. [Note: This statement is probably in response to a 20 July 1999 vote by the US House of Representatives to withhold funding for the IAEA.] He adds that Iran has called for a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East.
Former Iraqi nuclear scientist Husayn al-Sharistani is in Iran. He gives information [presumably to Iran] on Iraq's nuclear weapons program, information which is shared with Pakistan. Sharistani was previously imprisoned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for refusing to build nuclear weapons. [Note: He is also reported to be in Iran in 1992.]
Former Iraqi nuclear scientist Hussain al-Sharistani is seen in Iran. [Note: He was also seen in Iran in 1991. He was previously imprisoned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for refusing to build nuclear weapons but escaped.]
Former Iraqi nuclear scientist Hussain al-Sharistani says of Iran's nuclear program, "international conditions and Iran's present economic situation render a nuclear weapons program unfeasible. The Iranian nuclear program lacks scientific expertise, equipment, and nuclear installations." [Note: Sharistani was imprisoned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for refusing to build nuclear weapons, and then escaped during the Persian Gulf War. He was reported to be in Iran in 1991 and 1992.]
Four 82-ton water tanks are ready for delivery to the Bushehr nuclear power plant, says Nikolay Krivoshlykov, director-general of Atommash, the factory which built the tanks. They will be shipped to St. Petersburg and then by sea to Iran. The tanks are part of the reactor's emergency cooling system. The factory in Volgodonsk has an order for Bushehr worth $18 million.
Four men are arrested while trying to sell 1k g of uranium-235 in Batumi, Georgia. The leader of the group is Valiko Chkhivazde, a professional chemist. Shukri Abramidze, Leader of the Georgia Academy of Sciences Physics Institute's Atomic Center, believes the U-235 was destined for Iran.
France denies reports that it will supply Iran with highly enriched uranium pursuant to a possible secret addendum to the Eurodif deal. [Note: See 25 October 1991 and 29 December 1991].
A report released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council says Iran has two operating reactors that are suitable for plutonium production:the 5MWt reactor at Teheran University and the Isfahan NuclearResearch Center. The Teheran University reactor can produce600g of plutonium per year. Although the reactor's highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel could be used to produce a nuclear weapon, the spent fuel derived from it is low in plutonium content and therefore is not of proliferation concern. Toproduce sufficient plutonium for a nuclear weapon, Iran would have to set aside several years' worth of spent fuel, which i sin violation of its commitments under International AtomicEnergy Agency safeguards and the Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty. The Isfahan research reactor is only 27k W, and its output is insignificant. Three Iranian plants are suspected of conducting uranium enrichment research: the Sharif Universityof Technology, the Isfahan Nuclear Research Center, and theKaraj Nuclear Medical Research Center. IAEA inspectors believe that a calutron at Karaj is a 1 milliampere device, suitable only for medical purposes; including zinc separation. Incontrast, Iraq employed 600 milliampere calutrons for its nuclear weapons program. The Karaj calutron could be comparable to the China Institute of Atomic Energy's (CIAE's)F1 separator, which "has a beam operating in the range of hundreds of microamperes to several milliamperes." The F1 can enrich uranium to 36%, and is capable of separating lithium,potassium, rubidium, silver, neodymium, samarium, gadolinium,and erbium. Although the F1 is unsuitable for the separation of zinc, the CIAE's F2 and F3 versions, with "tens to hundreds of milliamperes of beam current," are believed to be capable of conducting zinc separation.
France loses a court case that it had brought against Iran for breach of a contract under which France was to construct two pressurized water reactors at Karun.
France's secretary general of the foreign ministry goes to Tehran to finalize the $1 billion Eurodif agreement between France and Iran. [Note: See 25 October 1991.] Further, France and Iran reach a preliminary understanding on the settlement of a disputed loan during the French Foreign Minister Francois Scheer's visit to the Iranian capital.
Frankfurter Allgemeine of Frankfurt/Main reports that, according to German intelligence sources, Iran aims to use Syria as a supplier route for its weapons of mass destruction programs. Syria is not subject to export controls as stringent as those against Iran, and has "fewer difficulties in the development of ultramodern mass destruction factories."
Frantisek Svitak, Vice President of Skoda Plzen Engineering Consortium in the Czech Republic, says the company is still considering trading with Iran in nuclear power technology, but will only do so through Russia.
Further indications of the split in Israeli thinking over Iran is indicated by two recent reports in the Israeli press. In the first report, Maariv presents four working assumptions regarding Iran's programs for weapons of mass destruction. The first is that sooner or later Iran will have the capability of launching long-range missiles with nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads. Second is that Iran is receiving aid in the development of these weapons from various countries including Russia, China, and North Korea. The third assumption is that the United States is the only country that can have a serious impact on Iranian arms development. And lastly, Israeli deterrence capability needs to be strengthened. Yifah Shapir, a researcher at the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies believes that Israeli officials overestimate Iran's technical capabilities. This tends to support US claims that Iran may not be able to integrate components received from various suppliers into a workable missile system.
A representative of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy tells ITAR-TASS that Russia is not going to curtail its nuclear power cooperation with Iran, in spite of such reports in some media outlets. The Russian representative said, "it will fully meet its commitments on the building of the first power unit of the nuclear power (NPP) in Bushehr....They say that the United States suggested to Russia exchanging of Iranian contracts for American contracts for the processing of nuclear fuel....The US suggestion is still a suggestion and nothing more, but we bear in mind that a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush."
Gad Yaacobi, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, says Iran devotes $800 million per year to the development of nuclear weapons. He warns that Iran has become "the main threat now" to peace in the Middle East.
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, says China is supplying Iran with uranium-enriching equipment. "There is no question that the supplies far exceed the needs of Iran's civilian nuclear industry," he says.
General Yuri Baluyevsky, Russian deputy chief of staff, says that Iran has received tactical nuclear weapons from a country other than Russia. [Note: He may be referring to Kazakhstan. See March 1993 entry.]
Gennadiy Kulik, Russian deputy prime minister, says Russia will fulfill its commitment to Iran to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Gennadiy Seleznev, chairman of the Russian State Duma, and Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Russia's Atomic Energy Organization, meet to discuss the development of ties between Russia and Iran regarding the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
A resolution being drafted at an IAEA Board of Governors meeting will include criticism of Iran for not disclosing all of its activities, with the intent thereby of precluding a possible move for sanctions.
Gennadiy Seleznev, Russian State Duma speaker, says nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran is based on the peaceful use of nuclear technology. The speaker affirms Russia's desire to help Iran set up a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East by stating, "We are vitally interested in the inadmissibility of spreading weapons of mass destruction in the region. The appearance of such weapons will not solve a single problem. It will, on the opposite, give rise to a complex of new one."
George Papandreou, the Foreign Minister of Greece who currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency, clarifies after a meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister that the EU has never claimed that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.
George Tenet, head of the CIA, says that Iran might be able to "produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of this decade...Obtaining material from outside could cut years from this estimate." John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org says that there is no evidence that Iran is building a reprocessing facility to produce weapon-grade plutonium.
Georgiy Kaurov, a spokesman at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, says spent fuel at Iran's nuclear power plants will be relocated to Russia in accordance with the contract signed between the two nations.
Georgiy Kaurov, spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, says there were never plans to sell centrifuges to Iran. Nor has a decision been reached as to whether Iranian spent fuel will be transferred to Russia or left in Iran under International Atomic Energy Agency supervision. Mikhail Kokeev, a deputy in the Russian Foreign Ministry, adds that Russia would not advocate projects which would improve Iran's military posture, but admitted that several entities within the Russian bureaucracy had contemplated supplying dual-use technologies to Iran.
Georgiy Kaurov, the head of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry's public relations department, says that Iran has started paying Russia for building the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He says Russian technicians are preparing the site for construction, which is to begin in May.
Georgiy Matchitidze, an official in the Russian Embassy in Iran, says due to financial problems in Iran and the imminent Russian elections, construction of the Bushehr nuclear power station will begin in 1996, not December 1995 as originally scheduled. Although Iran has paid Russia $60 million to conduct a feasibility study, Matchitidze says Iran has to pay at least $50 million more for Russia to begin construction. A Xinhua report says that only seven or eight Russian experts are working in Iran, with the rest returned to Russia, having completed the study on technical conditions for the plant. However, Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran disputes the report.
A review of Iranian documents released to the IAEA has provides disturbing insights into a vast worldwide procurement network for Iran's secret nuclear program, over a 17-year period. According to U.S. and European sources familiar with the investigation, Pakistan appears to have been the source of crucial technology that would enable Iran to become a nuclear weapons power.
Sources in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry state that Iran is showing interest in acquiring advanced air defense technologies for the protection of the Bushehr nuclear facilities.
Georgy Kaurov, spokesman for Russia's atomic energy minister, announces Russia will build two more nuclear reactors in Iran in addition to Russia's $850million deal to build a 1,000MW nuclear power plant atBushehr. Kaurov says Russia "agreed in principle" with Iran on the construction of two more reactors at Bushehr. Constructionis not expected to begin for five years. This new deal was nota signed contract, but was rather a verbal agreement. VitaliyNasonov, a spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry(Minatom) says, "Russia will not sign any new documents with Iran until it has completed the contract to build the nuclear power station at Bushehr." He says Russia is not refusing to expand cooperation with Iran entirely, just "not until the21st century." Russia and Iran initially signed a contract on8 January 1995 for the first reactor at Bushehr. Russia took over construction of the reactor at Bushehr in February 1998due to delays by Iran. Kaurov says that Russia plans to speed construction of the current project and expects to finish the reactor in two-and-one-half years. Next, construction would start on two new 640MW power reactors, "which are still being developed." [Note: This seems to be the first mention of 640MWreactors at Bushehr. Previously, two 440MW reactors had been discussed for Bushehr.] An unnamed American official doubts Iran will have enough money to pay for the planned reactors."Whether they can get the first one done is iffy, and the chance of their completing the second, third, or fourth is highly unlikely," the official says.
Georgy Kaurov, spokesperson for the Russian nuclear energy ministry, says that "no nuclear warheads of the former USSR and currently at Russia's disposal were either handed over or sold to other countries." His announcement comes in response to an article in the Jerusalem Post that alleges that Iran received two nuclear warheads from Kazakhstan. Kaurov assures that "not a single [warhead] has disappeared."
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announces the "American administration very much supports this [EU] position." With talks currently deadlocked and Tehran refusing to give up enrichment, the Europeans insist the enrichment program must be terminated as an "objective guarantee" that Iran is not pursuing arms.
A Russian atomic energy official says Russia intends to sign contracts to build another three reactors at Iran's Bushehr nuclear energy plant. One would be the 1000MW VVER-1000 light water reactor and the other two would be the 440MW VVER-440 reactors, says the unnamed official of Russia's Ministry for Nuclear Energy. The official also says there is an understanding between Iran and Russia to train Iranian nuclear experts to use the Russian-made reactors at Bushehr, but he says "the understanding is only verbal and no documents have been signed on this score." [Note: See 4 May 1995.]
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder anticipates a successful outcome of the nuclear talks between Iran and the European Union stating the "common goal" is that Tehran renounces its availability of nuclear weapons.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder calls the agreement reached between Iran and three EU representatives as "good and important."
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder tells reporters that both he and U.S. President George Bush agree Iran "must waive any right to the production [of uranium] thereof, and they must renounce the right to even close the fuel cycle."
German news outlet DDP reports that a German company may have shipped material to Iran that could be used to make nuclear weapons. Bremen-based company J.C. Niemann reportedly shipped round aluminum rods without an export license. The Bremen Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating the matter for four years and is considering charges. [Note: The report does not state when the material was allegedly shipped to Iran.]
German police arrest a Spanish or Columbian national who arrived in Munich on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow carrying 300 grams of plutonium concealed in a metal box and "lead foil." After being told by the arrested man that two people, a Frenchman and a Spaniard, were waiting for him at the airport, German police were able to arrest them as well. According to another source, the man smuggling "between 100 and 300 grams" of plutonium is a Spanish businessman named Javier Bengoechea Arratibel. The source also said that Bavarian police had arrested a "Columbian and two Spaniards," and that those arrested were not part of "an international terrorist group". According to an article in Der Spiegel, confirmed by police spokesman Fritz Dillinger, approximately 2.2l bs of lithium 6 were seized as well. Officials with Bavaria's special police services believe that the illegal shipment "could wind up in an Arab country's embassy." Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran have been named as possibilities. Russian Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Sidorenko was also on the Lufthansa flight.
Germany creates "coordination agency for Iran" in Cologne's customs investigation office. This agency will monitor "suspicious 'Iranian-controlled firms in Germany'." German customs officials are currently investigating 10 organizations for illicit sales to Iran.
Germany refuses to resume construction of the 80-percent-complete Siemens-built nuclear power plant at Bushehr for fear that it could be accused of helping advance Iran's nuclear weapons program.
Germany says it will deny requests from Siemens and from Iran to approve export licenses for components for the Bushehr reactors in Iran. Siemens denies reports that it will rebuild the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Germany, France, and Britain's foreign ministries have release identical statements criticizing Iran's announced plan to start up a uranium enrichment facility in Isfahan, saying it "sends the wrong signal regarding Iran's readiness to implement a suspension of its activities." UN ambassador Pirooz Husseini rejects the criticism, saying "the plant is a totally separate issue from out commitment to the suspension of uranium enrichment;" he added that he would be discussing the situation with the three European representatives in the next few days.
Germany, France, and Great Britain decline to reply to a list of Iranian demands that includes access to advanced dual-use nuclear technology, removal of restrictions on Iranian nuclear sales, agreement to sell conventional weapons to Iran, assurances regarding the Europeans' commitment to Iran, and support for a nuclear-free Middle East.
Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) says that Iran's nuclear programs focus on all phases of the fuel cycle. Iran is a "center of proliferation activities," even though no proof of any Iranian nuclear bomb exists.
A Russian delegation led by Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Reshetnikov visits Tehran to partially renegotiate the January 1995 contract providing for the construction of Bushehr nuclear power station's first unit in Iran. In particular, Minatom seeks to guarantee that Russian nuclear fuel burned in Iranian reactors will be returned to Russia as spent fuel for reprocessing. According to the contract, Russia will begin supplying fuel when the power station is completed in 2001, and will continue for 30 years. The installation of the Russian VVER-1000 [1000MW] reactor, shipment of the fuel, and loading the fuel into the reactor will be under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Intending to develop closer relations with Russia, Iran expresses interest in building a second unit at Bushehr using another 1,000MW VVER-1000 light water reactor (LWR), and a third and fourth unit employing 440MW VVER-440 reactors. Successful talks may prompt amendments to the original contract, potentially raising the contract's estimated cost to over $800 million.
Germany's Leybold AG sharply tightens its export controls on nuclear-related items, virtually prohibiting the transfer of dual-use items to Iran. Leybold checks with German and US authorities and investigates its potential buyers before making a sale, and through use of databases it seeks to identify possible third-party front companies that might be attempting to buy items for threshold states.
Gholam Aghazadeh, Iranian Vice-President, states after talks with the Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian Atomic Energy Minister, that he is hopeful that Russia will begin to supply Bushehr with nuclear fuel. Mr. Rumyantsev says that Russia will supply one load of 500 kilos of nuclear fuel from its Siberian storage facilities for the experimental launch of Bushehr and 10 loads of 500 kilos of nuclear fuel for the operation of the plant.
Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, Iran's atomic energy chief offers, Russia a chance to build more nuclear power stations in Iran. He states, "Beside Bushehr, we intend to build several more nuclear power stations with the overall power capacity of 6,000 megawatts, and we are offering Russia a chance to take up this opportunity."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (IAO) head, announces the completion of Bushehr power plant "will open a new chapter in Tehran-Moscow ties and will assure the Iranian nation and government that Russia is serious in expanding its ties with Iran." Georgiy Kaurov, ministry spokesman, tells Al-Hayah, that a tentative agreement regarding the possible construction of two more nuclear reactors for use as electric power generators, and a reactor for research use will be discussed.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), says Iran opposes nuclear tests by all countries. Aqazadeh says US claims that Iran is seeking to obtain a nuclear device are false, and that any program meant to develop a nuclear weapon does not exist. If the United States is serious about nonproliferation in the Middle East, Aqazadeh says, then it should limit its cooperation with Israel to develop nuclear missiles. At the same time, Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Minister of Nuclear Energy, reemphasizes the completion of the Bushehr nuclear power plant will not provide Iran with the means to develop nuclear weapons.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, meets in Russia with officials regarding the progress on the Bushehr nuclear power plant, bilateral cooperation on nuclear power plants, and upgrading existing nuclear cooperation. The two sides agree that the remaining work on Bushehr would have to go more quickly. A report on the plant will be given to the International Atomic Energy Organizaiton. Gholam Reza Agazadeh also says that 26% of the nuclear power plant is completed and that 25% of the station power engineering equipment has been installed.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that the construction of the nuclear power plant at Bushehr is on schedule and that the project has reached "a good technical level."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, met with Dr. Mohammed El Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and emphasized his willingness to continue close cooperation in the future. Mr. Aqazadeh says that Iran is willing to continue its cooperation with the IAEA in reaching an annual output of 6000MW of atomic energy and in conducting atomic sciences research work inside Iran. Mr. Aqazadeh emphasizes, "The expansion of Iran's atomic energy production capabilities is based on a precisely scientific, pre-planned basis, and Iran is determined to follow its objectives in full cooperation and harmony with the IAEA."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, assures Muhammad al-Baradi, the new Secretary-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that Iran will follow all regulations dictated under the purview of the Agency in an effort to obtain information necessary to use nuclear technologies. In light of the fact that Iran will deplete its oil reserves in 20 years, Aqazadeh asserts, Iran must strive to obtain the necessary know-how in nuclear technology applications.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, informs reporters in Russia that Iran "has never tried to use Russian nuclear technology for military purposes." Agreements pertaining to nuclear technology transfers between the Iran and Russia, he asserts, are based on a doctrine of peaceful collaboration. This collaboration is finalized in a protocol concerning the agreement between Russia and Iran over the building of Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. He announces Iran's interest in building new nuclear power stations and facilities. Aqazadeh asserts that for nuclear power stations to be efficient they must have research facilities to act as an adjunct, "to ensure normal operation of the nuclear plant."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran will pursue cooperation with Russia and China because Iran "cannot let go of major investments" in nuclear technology. "Our oil and gas resources are limited and the use of atomic energy is necessary for us," he says. He says Iran wants to buy two additional 440MW reactors from Russia and two 300MW reactors from China.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, Iranian Vice President and head of the Iranian Nuclear Energy Organization, says that Iran is not interested in nuclear arms production but seeks to acquire nuclear know how to generate electricity to meet its energy demands. He also says that Iran plans to build a factory for the production of uranium yellow cake. As he put it, "the [Iranian Nuclear Energy] Organization started its activities by drilling special wells in Arkedan of Yazd, where uranium reserves lie deep underground. It now plans to build a factory for the production of yellow cake." He also says, "With the completion of the Isfahan factory in the near future, we hope to complete the fuel cycle and indigenously produce fuel for our plants."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, Iran's vice president, announces he will meet with the chiefs of Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry in an effort to determine "a new timetable and to break the deadlock" regarding construction delays of Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran.
Gholam Reza Shafei, Iranian Ambassador in Moscow, says that Iran is ready to sign an agreement with Russia concerning the return of used nuclear fuel from Russia.
Gholam Reza Shafei, Iranian ambassador to Russia, and a delegation of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran visits the Ordzhonikidze plant near Moscow. The plant is building the fourth steam generator for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Thee first three generators have been shipped to Iran. Shafei says it is important for the project to be finished according to schedule. He says Iran hopes to be compensated for delays in construction of the plant.
Gholam Reza Shafei, Iran's ambassador to Russia, rejects the US accusations that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. He adds that the Iranian-Russian agreement has no military dimension and that the International Atomic Energy Agency regularly visits the Bushehr reactor.
Gholamreza Aghazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (IAEO), says the topics for future IAEA Board of Governors discussions were unpredictable, since "at present all the issues related with Iran are political."
Gholamreza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, announces the cessation of centrifuge building for uranium enrichment. UN inspectors have reported finding only "hundreds" of centrifuges, well below what would be needed to build nuclear weaponry. Aqazedeh states that Iran's voluntary action is specifically to engender international trust and confidence.
Gholamreza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, in his address to the 46th general conference of the IAEA, says that Iran, as a vanguard of advocates of nuclear-free zones, played an active role in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in 1974, in the UN General Assembly. He states, "The Islamic Republic of Iran, in line with the Islamic and humanitarian beliefs, has always fostered cooperation with the IAEA and has carried out all the scientific and research programs and civilian application of nuclear energy especially the Bushehr power plant in coordination with the international agency and its supervision." Mr. Aqazadeh says that in the next 20 years Iran has long-term plans to set up nuclear plants to bring its electricity output capacity of 6,000 megawatts. Mr. Aqazadeh mentions that Iran calls for transparency in nuclear programs and always condemns any country that may seek access to the weapons of mass destruction.
Gholamreza Shafe'i, Iranian ambassador to Russia, rejects Western media claims that Russia had retreated from its past positions as it related to cooperation with Iran. He states, "Contrary to such rumors, since last month, the Russians have actually become more serious about cooperating with Iran." With regard to the 10-year cooperation plan between Russia and Iran, the Iranian ambassador says, "The Russian government has approved of the plan and it has no intention of backtracking on the issue of cooperation with Iran.".... "The Plan will serve Russian interests even more than Iranian interests." He adds, "The atomic cooperation between Iran and Russia is aimed at making peaceful use of atomic energy and that is something that every country, even America, has approved of."... "The International Atomic Energy Agency has not observed even one case of wrongdoing at the Bushehr reactor."
Gholamreza Shafei, Tehran's ambassador to Moscow, announces Iranian readiness to sign the pending nuclear fuel agreement with Russia later this month. Mr. Shafei also confirms that Iran is "considering a moratorium, which means a temporary suspension, and not a full stoppage of uranium enrichment;" also that Iran is prepared to allow the IAEA to inspect, saying "if the agency's experts tell us two hours in advance they wish to visit this or that nuclear facility, they will have the permission." Referring to the United States, Shafei stresses that Iran does "not wish to get into conflict with anyone, [but] we will strongly defend our national interests."
Gid'on Frank, head of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission, says there has been no change in Israel's nuclear policy. [Note: He may be referring to a 19 December 1997 article in the International Herald Tribune that Israel may puts its nuclear forces on high alert.]
Glenn Schweitzer, director of the National Research Council's Office for Central Europe and Eurasia, says he has met specialists in nuclear weapons-related fields, and some of them had tried to go to North Korea, some were working for China, and others were being recruited by India and Iran. Schweitzer suggests that the United States expand existing projects and create new ones that will provide cutting-edge research opportunities for nuclear weapons scientists in non-weapons-related areas.
Global News Wire reports that the German intelligence service, Bundes Nachrichten Dienst (BND), says Iran is attempting to build nuclear weapons at a site outside of Isfahan, Iran.
Goergiy Kaurov, the head of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry's public relations department, says that Russia is taking every measure to prevent misuse of Russian technology for military purposes.
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou says it is Iran's absolute right to use peaceful nuclear energy in the framework of international regulations and urged EU's cooperation with Iran.
Greenpeace International asks Iran not to "go nuclear" following nuclear weapons test conducted by India and Pakistan. Simon Caroll, nuclear and disarmament advisor to the Netherlands-based environmental and human rights group, says he "hopes that recent nuclear testings by India and Pakistan do not induce Iran and other countries in the Middle East to follow suit...though we have no evidence that Iran is moving in that direction."
A Russian delegation led by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and a US delegation lead by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher begin discussions on Russia's nuclear deal with Iran. Russian National Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev are also members of the Russian delegation. Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg Davydov says that Russia is compelled to cooperate with Iran because of its geographic location and because it is not in Russia's interest to have another "unfriendly neighbor in the vicinity of its southern border." Davydov denies reports that the United States had shown Russian officials an Iranian "blueprint" for nuclear weapons development. Instead, Davydov characterizes the report as an analysis which points toward Iran's intentions to "be closer to development of nuclear weapons." A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said that there was no substantiated evidence that Russian nuclear reactors in Iran were going to be used for non-peaceful purposes. The official said that Russian agencies "in charge of nuclear nonproliferation have the deal under their firm control" and that Russia has resolved "to leave no loophole for proliferation of nuclear weapons." The Russian-Iranian reactor deal calls for the completion of a nuclear power plant with a 1,880MW capacity. The Bushehr facility will likely have four reactors, the first with a 1,000MW capacity, the second with an unspecified capacity, the third and fourth reactors each with a 440MW capacity.
Haaretz of Tel Aviv reports that Israel and the United States failed to reach an agreement on how to induce Russia into halting its assistance to Iran to develop weapons of mass destruction. Haaretz reports Israel has suggested military action be taken against Iran, an action Israel has failed to convince the United States to take. Israel believes the time to strike Iran is limited and if Russia continues its aid, Iran will have ballistic missiles capable of mounting nonconventional warheads within 12 to 18 months.
Haaretz of Tel Aviv reports that Israeli intelligence believes Iran will be able to create a nuclear bomb by 2005, but this can be stopped if Russia stops providing assistance. [Note: See 24 August and 13 September 2001.]
Haaretz of Tel Aviv reports that the deal for Russia to supply Iran two additional 440MW nuclear reactors has been canceled because of financing difficulties. The Israeli daily further reports that as many as 1,400 Russians will work on construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Haaretz reports that an analysis by Professor Shay Feldman, due to appear in Update, the publication of Tel Aviv University's Institute of Strategic Studies, says, "It does not seem that Pakistan will transfer nuclear materials or sensitive nuclear technology to Iran or one of the Arab states." Feldman says the decision is based on Pakistan's desire to maintain its nuclear edge over Iran, which he believes will "constitute the undermining of its recently acquired advantage."
Haaretz reports that China's ambassador to Israel, Pan Zhanlin, asserts that China opposes the spread of weapons of mass destruction and would punish any Chinese company exporting such technology. This statement was in response to allegations of Chinese exports of arms technology to Iran.
After a meeting with Iranian Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq Jahangiri, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko tells journalists that Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, would visit Moscow in August or September. Sources in the Russian government have reported that Aqazadeh will visit Russia to discuss cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Aksyonenko also tells journalists that Russian Prime Minister Igor Ivanov is planning to visit Tehran. Aksyonenko said, "we are ready to sign an intergovernmental agreement on scientific and technical cooperation."
Haaretz reports that Iran approached Israel through the United Kingdom to discuss nuclear proposals, such as not striking first, not arming missiles with nuclear warheads, and restricting long-range missiles. Israel refused to respond to the proposals, in part because doing so could acknowledge the existence of Israeli nuclear weapons. [Note: See 30 September 1999.]
Haaretz reports that Iran is considering the acquisition of a nuclear research reactor from India on the condition that India guarantees it will "uphold its commitments," according to Iranian National Energy Agency head Husayn Mashayqi. The Indian Atomic Energy Ministry, said Mashayqi, reneged on a proposal to build a research reactor in Iran during the 1980s.
Haaretz reports that Iran is trying to procure a nuclear reactor for research purposes from India. Hussain Mashayqi, head of the Iranian National Energy Agency, met in New Delhi for the conference of the International Agency for National Energy, where Mashayqi was quoted as saying "we greatly value our cooperation with the Indian nuclear scientists and we are willing to renew talks with them." He further promulgated Iran's adherence to the established rules of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), assuring that Iran's nuclear program is "completely transparent."
Haaretz reports that Russia has uncovered an Iranian network seeking to procure nuclear weapon technology. According to Viktor Posuvalyuk, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, the network comprises several students studying nuclear physics and missile science and one working through an Iranian embassy. Posuvalyuk says the effort to cut off the students' access to the information is an example of the Russian administration's continuing efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining information useful in developing nonconventional weapon systems.
Haaretz reports that, according to "Project Risk," a non-governmental organization that tracks weapons proliferation, Iran purchases prohibited and sensitive technology via front companies in the guise of charitable organizations. The most active is the Bonyad-e Mostazafin ("Foundation for the Oppressed"). Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres says that German organizations "are the most problematic" for selling sensitive technology to Iran. Peres says that the German government does not always actively try to stop illicit shipments to Iran. The United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency acknowledges a strong relationship with the German government, but says, "there are sectors of German industry that are more mechanized to help Iran's nuclear efforts."
A Russian diplomat says that the world community does not have any solid evidence that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.
Haaretz reports that, according to Israeli analysts, Iran is accelerating its attempts to acquire conventional and unconventional weapons. The analysts also report that Iran now needs significantly less time than was expected to produce a nuclear weapon. The reports also adds that Iran is doing all it can to achieve nuclear capability.
Hadi Najad-Hosseinian, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, on a visit to Washington, DC, says Iran would not abandon its nuclear weapons program. The Washington Times reports US intelligence services believe Iran has undoubtedly spent between $12-15 billion to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
Hamburg Stern reports additional details of Iran's European smuggling network, as provided in a German report on the Iranian Defense Industries Organization. German officials believe that Germany is the central location for the Iranian procurement network. This problem has been aggravated by the fact that Iran has received loans worth 5 billion DM from Germany and Germany appears unwilling to enforce laws concerning dual-use items. It is believed that part of these loans have been used to found a machine-tool industry in Iran. This program started in 1992 and is indicative of the ineffectiveness of the western embargo against Iran.
Hamian Vahdati, thought to be heading Iran's nuclear program, says that no country can be taken seriously without a nuclear research program, and that Iran wants to have the technology and knowledge to make nuclear weapons in case it needs them. Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Vaezi asserts that Iran opposes nuclear weapons buildup.
Hamid Reza Asefi, Foreign Ministry spokesman for Iran, says that despite the use of chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction against Iran, Iran "has never embarked on production of such weapons." The report comes after allegations by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that Iran is seeking foreign sources of technology to develop weapons of mass destruction. [Note: See 7 September 2001.] Asefi compares Iran's compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards with Israel's lack of transparency. "Iran's defensive and nuclear cooperation with some foreign countries are within the framework of international conventions, in line with the industrial and economic development of the country and aimed at maintaining world peace and security," he says.
Hamid Reza Asefi, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, announces that regardless of the outcome of current talks with the Europeans, Iran will resume uranium enrichment sooner rather than later.
Hamid Reza Asefi, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, says that contrary to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent statement, Iran is not seeking access to nuclear weapons. Asefi adds that Iranian-Russian nuclear cooperation is for "peaceful purposes" and that all nuclear programs are under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Russia is helping Iran build the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran.
Hamid Reza Assefi, spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry, denies that Iran has approached Israel through the United Kingdom with proposals on limiting nuclear weapons. "The Islamic Republic of Iran's talks with the British government concerned international disarmament and ways of confronting proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction," he says. "Neither in these or any other talks anything was raised to link these measures with the Zionist regime." The British Foreign Office also denies that it acted as an intermediary between Iran and Israel on the issue of nuclear arms. [Note: See 29 September 1999.]
Hamida Edalat, MP from Bushehr, says "it is not true that Russian experts are leaving Iran after pressures were exerted by America." She adds that "parts of executive operation that were to be handed over to Iranians according to the contract are being handed over and the Russian experts are leaving the country for this reason." Hamid Reza Asefi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, says there has been no change in Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation. Aleksandr Maryanov, Russian ambassador to Iran, says Russia will fulfill its obligation to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant. And "will be implementing in full all accords reached in connection with this project no matter what the prospects for expanding Russian-Iranian cooperation in the sphere of nuclear energy might be."
A Russian expert tells Interfax that Russia is abiding by international standards in cooperation with Iran. He states "we are tightening export control. Russia's conscience is clear ... Russia is not involved in creating a full nuclear cycle in Iran."
Hamidreza Asefi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, announces that Iran and Russia have no serious differences as concerns cooperation in the nuclear sphere. Talks during Russian Atomic Energy Minister Rumyantsev's upcoming visit to Tehran will focus mainly on "repatriating to Russia spent nuclear fuel originating in that country."
Hamshahri of Tehran reports that three mines with 800 tons of uranium reserves were discovered in Yazd Province, Iran.
Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, meets with Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, to discuss an agreement banning nuclear weapons. Rafsanjani praises the IAEA's work in promoting safety and arms control. Referring to Iraq, Rafsanjani says that merely signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is not sufficient. Some countries, he says, will not adhere to international regulations, although of course Iran will.
Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, says he has "no cause for concern" regarding Iran's attempts to acquire nuclear technology. But he says the IAEA may begin implementing special inspections for problem nations, with Iran as a possible test case.
Hans Blix, Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, inspects the Karaj Nuclear Research Center in Iran. He concludes the facility is for peaceful purposes only.
Hans Blix, Secretary-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, assures Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, that cooperation between the Agency and Iran will continue. He says, "I have always announced that no violation had been seen while conducting inspections in the Islamic Republic of Iran." Aqazadeh says Iran hopes to produce 20% of its power from nuclear power, an ambition he hopes will be aided by potential agreements with China and Russia.
Hans Blix, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), pays a secret visit to Israel for "professional consultations." A senior IAEA team is soon to go to Iran to investigate suspicions of Iranian centrifugal uranium enrichment plant.
Harvard University arms control expert Graham Allison says Israel and the United States have improperly characterized Russian ballistic missile technology transfers to Iran as a matter of deliberate Russian foreign policy. Allison believes that the transfers are instead the product of a combination of private Russian business interests and corrupt government bureaucrats. Allison believes that if it were Russian government policy to export weapons technology to Iran, complete missile and nuclear weapons systems would be transferred rather than components. Vladimir Orlov, director of the Center for Policy Studies in Russia, says that the effective implementation of Russian export controls is highly dependent upon the effectiveness of Russian customs officials.
Hasan Ruhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, says Iran is not building nuclear arms and that the International Atomic Energy Agency can investigate American allegations.
Hassan Rohani, head of the Supreme National Security Council, cancels a visit to Russia to discuss Iran's nuclear program. It is speculated that the cancellation is due to a coincident three-day visit to Moscow by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
Hassan Rohani, secretary general of the Iranian National Supreme Security Council, says that, "Iran will start operating its nuclear facility in Isfahan early next [Iranian] year." The Iranian calendar year starts on 21 March. The United States fears the uranium processing plant may be a part of a secret program to develop nuclear weapons.
A Russian foreign intelligence report says Iran has devised a way to dodge export regulations. Other reports refer to extensive Iranian efforts to procure fissile material.
Hassan Rowhani threatens to follow North Korea's lead if Washington refers Iran to the UN Security Council.
Hassan Rowhani, secretary of the Supreme National Council, states that Iran has no objections to transparency of its nuclear interests and hid portions of its legal nuclear activities due to "illegal sanctions" and an "increase in the number of embargoes," in the past. He further claims Iran has always taken initiative over signing disarmament treaties and sees creation of WMD an act that would weaken stability and security in the region and world.
Hassan Rowhani, secretary-general of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, says "If such an attack [by the United States] takes place then of course we will retaliate and we will definitely accelerate our activities to complete our fuel cycle and make nuclear fuel." On the same subject, Qolamreza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, states that if, for example, the Bushehr nuclear power plant were to be attacked by Israel or the United States, Iran is "capable of restoring everything in the minimum time."
Hassan Ruhani, deputy speaker of Iran's Majlis (Parliament), says that Germany should pay Iran "18 billion marks related to the Bushehr nuclear court case."
Hassan Ruhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, says that Iran will respect the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Head of Iran's parliament foreign policy commission, Alaeddin Borujerdi says if the Europeans insist Iran permanently suspend uranium enrichment, "it will be our last nuclear negotiation with them [Europeans]."
Hennadiy Udovenko, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, says it will look into participation by the Ukrainian company Turboatom in the Russian-Iranian contract for the construction of a nuclear power plant in Bushehr, Iran.
A Russian Foreign Ministry official says Russia will not recall its nuclear experts from the Bushehr nuclear power plant, despite fears expressed by US State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns that they could be a source of "leaks of information on nuclear military technology." The unnamed diplomat says such leaks are prevented by the procedure Russia uses to select nuclear experts to send to Iran as well as the peaceful nature of their work in Iran. "It is more in the interest of Russia than...the United States that no new nuclear states should appear along the borders of Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States," he says.
Hoping that Iranian dissident groups will mount a coup against the Iranian government before it develops nuclear weapons, some senior officials at the Pentagon are suggesting widespread covert operation against the Iranian regime.
Hossein Mousavian, a chief Iranian nuclear negotiator, has allowed for the possibility of permitting IAEA inspectors to return to Parchin for further environmental samples.
Hossein Mousavian, a senior Iranian security official, has stated that Tehran may resume uranium enrichment in March if EU talks "fail to yield satisfactory progress." Regardless, Mousavian states that Iran will consider extending the enrichment freeze only until June and that the nuclear fuel cycle work would never be scrapped. However, "we are fully prepared for a comprehensive arrangement to give all assurances that Iran will not seek nuclear bombs."
Hossein Musavian, chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, announces an agreement has been reached with Russia to provide nuclear fuel for Iran's nuclear program. Musavian further says the United States and Europe did not have any "problems" with this cooperation.
Hossien Afarideh, Chairman of the Iranian Parliament's Energy Commission, says that the allegation of some politicians that the Russian-Iranian cooperation on nuclear energy for peaceful use has "a dual meaning are groundless." Mr. Afarideh emphasizes that "every one knows that the nuclear power plant in Bushehr is being built for energy production purposes only....Moreover, the construction of the power plant has been monitored by the IAEA experts."
Husayn Afarideh, head of the Iranian Majlis Energy Commission, calls upon the International Atomic Energy Agency to prevent propaganda against Iran's peaceful nuclear programs. In a meeting with Werner Burkart, IAEA deputy director, Afarideh points out the IAEA positive reports about Iran and the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear program. Afarideh invites Burkart and IAEA high officials to visit nuclear facilities in Iran, including Bushehr.
Husayn Afarideh, head of the Iranian Majlis Energy Commission, says that the International Atomic Energy Agency has planned 70 visits to the Bushehr nuclear power plant during the next year. He adds that the construction of the plant is going well and that about 1,000 Russian experts are at the site.
Husayn Afarideh, head of the Majlis energy commission, says that the construction of the Bushehr nuclear reactor will be undertaken under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Melissa Fleming, spokesperson of the IAEA says that IAEA representatives have visited the nuclear plant before and that once nuclear materials are supplied to the plant, four to six visits will be carried out a year.
Husayn Musavian, Iran's ambassador to Germany, refutes allegations made by German intelligence that Iran was buying nuclear material. He says that Iran is ready to cooperate with Germany in curbing nuclear proliferation.
Hussein Mussavian, deputy Secretary of National Security in Iran meets with head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, and Sergey Kislyakov, Deputy Foreign Minister on Non-Proliferation of WMD to prepare a list of documents on an "agreement about mutual protection of secret information and protection of intellectual property, exchanged within the time frame of military-technical cooperation." Sirus Nasseri, an Iranian delegation representative, says Iran is growing impatient with the negotiation results and wants to focus on getting Russian support for continuation of its program of "peaceful atom."
IAEA adopts a resolution to urge Iran to comply with their requests for full transparency by the end of October.
IAEA Chief ElBaradei criticizes the EU draft resolution on Iran as inadequate, a view echoed by the United States.
IAEA deputy director General Pierre Goldschmidt announces that results from the inspection of five Iranian nuclear sites in early January found no "suspicious equipment."
IAEA Director General ElBaradei circulates his report on the agency's nuclear verification in Iran. He praises Iran's cooperation with regard to site access especially, but expresses dismay at the dearth of "prompt information." He describes the P-2 centrifuge discovery as a "setback" and expresses the hope that it would be Iran's last oversight with regard to program disclosure. ElBaradei also suggests that a "comprehensive" suspension of centrifuge manufacturing and assembly would be a good confidence-building measure.
IAEA Director General ElBaradei, speaking in Brussels, suggests that Iran is being more cooperative than in the past and that nuclear program verification in Iran is "moving in the right direction."
IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei wants Iran to sign on to the Additional Protocol of the NPT to allow the IAEA inspections at any time. "If you have nothing to hide, there is no reason not to be transparent."
IAEA Director Mohammad ElBaradei, calls on Iran to provide additional documents relating to its nuclear program. The head of the IAEA said the request was to "make up for a lack of confidence created by years of concealment," but also stressed there was no proof Iran is attempting to build nuclear weapons.
IAEA Director Mohammed ElBaradei says Washington "would have to step in" as Tehran needs security guarantees beyond those given by the EU. "I think that when the issue of security comes up, obviously the United States will have to step in, because... the Iranians will very much need the American and not just European assurance," he said.
A Russian intelligence officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that it was "totally unfeasible" for Iran to build a nuclear weapon. He says that Russian and other foreign intelligence estimates put an Iranian nuclear weapons capability at least 10 years in the future. The intelligence officer said that the world community could control Iran's nuclear development, and prevent it from gaining access to nuclear weapons. The officer responds to Western and Israeli criticism about Russia's role in the project to construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr by saying that Russia had more to lose than the critics of the project did. "Our country, due to its geographic proximity, should be more alarmed by the prospect of nuclear weapons in Iran than Israel," he says.
IAEA Director-General ElBareidi says he hopes to have the report of the Iranian documents on whether they complied with IAEA demands out in about two weeks.
IAEA Director-General ElBareidi states that Tehran has refused to cease its uranium enrichment.
IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBareidi flies to Iran to attempt to avert an international crisis over its alleged nuclear weapons program. "The key issue is the enrichment program to make sure we have seen all nuclear experiments that have taken place in Iran; that we have seen all the nuclear material in Iran," says Dr. ElBareidi to Guardian reporters.
IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBareidi says he has been assured of Iran's willingness to cooperate and speed up the process of answering all of IAEA's questions on its activities during his visit to Iran.
IAEA Head ElBareidi says, "[Iran] has promised information will be forthcoming but it has not yet been provided. The central question is whether Iran has any [uranium] enrichment activities that we have not been informed about. On that question I haven't got satisfactory information." The statement is made as Iran is fast approaching the 31 October deadline.
IAEA Head Mohamed ElBaradei sets expectations as a team of senior IAEA inspectors prepare for their visit to Iran on 2 November. ElBaradei reassures that the 31 October deadline is "decisive and non-negotiable."
IAEA inspectors arrive at the Parchin base near Tehran. Hossein Mousavian, a member of Iran's nuclear negotiations team, stresses the inspectors' partial access to the site: "It is not necessary for the inspectors to enter the installations. They are authorized to take samples outside (the buildings) using their equipment."
IAEA Inspectors find traces of highly enriched uranium (HEU) at Iran's Natanz nuclear plant. Iranian officials claim the traces came from equipment imported from "another country" [unidentified] which included centrifuges used to enrich uranium and machinery associated with them. Mark Gwozdecky, a spokesman for the IAEA says Iran has "a large and sophisticated nuclear program".
IAEA inspectors seek access to two secret Iranian military sites. Intelligence data suggests the Iranian Ministry of Defense may be working on atomic weapons there. The information is based on satellite photos indicating testing of high explosives, and procurement records showing the purchase of equipment that may be used for uranium enrichment. The two sites are the decades-old Parchin military complex, southeast of Tehran, and a newer facility, Lavizan II, built in northeastern Tehran. Information on the second site was provided by the Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance to Iran (NCRI).
IAEA receives comprehensive documents from Iran on its past nuclear activities.
IAEA Spokeswoman Melissa Fleming says, "There are two phases to our work. The first phase involves Iran providing all the information to us on unresolved questions no later than October 31." The second is said to involve the verification of the information provided by them. IAEA stands firm on the deadline.
IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming states that the IAEA has conducted several inspections in Iran since Mohamed El Baradei's last visit to Iran in February. Ms. Fleming also reveals that various swipe samples have been gathered by the inspectors and are currently being analyzed by the agency.
IAEA talks stall with regard to a U.S.-backed resolution condemning Iran for its alleged nuclear weapons development activities. Non-aligned states hope to integrate praise for Iran's cooperation efforts thus far.
IAEO Director Gholamreza Aqazadeh complains that nuclear negotiations with the European Union are slow and not up to Iran's expectations, a subject he is broaching in his meetings with EU officials in Brussels. The European Union insists that the negotiations are "on track" and moving quickly enough. Aqazadeh described his meeting with the EU's Javier Solana as positive however, adding: "The next round of negotiations between Iran and the EU will be more intense and more realistic."
IAEO head Rohani, speaking in Tokyo, states that Iran would accept nuclear verification teams into the country again after March 27th. IAEA head ElBaradei declared confidence that progress in the Iran case would be made, and that the "ball is clearly in Iran's court" in any attempt to absolve it of possible military intentions attached to its nuclear technology and research.
Igor Ivanov, Russian Foreign Affairs Minister, rejects US allegations that Russia has supplied dual-use items to Iran.
A Russian minister accuses the United States of hypocrisy in criticizing Russian sales of nuclear technology to Iran, while ignoring similar activity by western companies. Alexander Rumyantsev says, "We also have complaints against the United States....It is always criticizing us, but its close economic partners supply Iran with sensitive technology."
A delegation of officials from Russia's nuclear industry goes to Tehran to discuss payment for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Sources say $700 million will be paid in cash and $300 million in barter goods, mostly food. The rights to import the barter goods have reportedly gone to Imperial bank, with ties to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Stolichny bank, with ties to Moscow Mayer Yury Luzhkov and National Security Advisor Boris Berezovsky.
