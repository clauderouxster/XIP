Emma Udwin, spokeswoman for the European Commission, says that the EU understands Iran's need to develop a nuclear program for peaceful uses but advised the Iranians to sign the IAEA additional protocol to remove suspicions about their intentions.
Eshaq Jahangiri, the Iranian Minister of Industries and Mines, says that the Jajorm Alumina project, the biggest mineral project to date in Iran, is to be put into operation in March of 2002. The implementation of this project will diminish Iranian reliance on imports and save it considerable amount of expenses.
EU diplomats report that French President, Jacques Chirac, "urged his negotiators to consider Iran's proposal it be allowed to have an enrichment plant with 3000 centrifuges." Chirac's position may be due to Iran's upcoming elections or "diplomatic politeness." Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon reemphasized that Israel would not act unilaterally and called for international action instead.
EU foreign ministers urge Iran to meet its pledge to stop uranium enrichment and allow inspections of its nuclear program. Concern is raised as Iran has still not set solid dates for these steps.
EU foreign policy representative Javier Solana stresses that the European Union cannot deliver on trade and technological benefits until Iran provides "concrete guarantees that its [nuclear] program has only peaceful ends."
EU trio diplomats complain that "we are on the defensive now" in nuclear negotiations due to resume with Iran on April 29th. Talks now center on the Iranian proposal versus its cessation of uranium enrichment. Iran's proposal includes building up its enrichment program in stages under close monitoring by the IAEA, eventually to be expanded into a commercial-scale enrichment plant with 54,000 centrifuges, producing low-grade enriched uranium for power plants. According to nuclear experts, a 3,000-centrifuge strength plant could produce enough highly-enriched uranium for one and a half warheads per year.
European diplomats and intelligence agencies report that Iran has removed some of the "yellow cake" uranium from the Isfahan facility. The accusations come at the same time IAEA inspectors inventory the raw processed uranium. The diplomats indicate the discrepancies could be on account of uranium being removed or lost in the waste process.
European diplomats say France, Britain and Germany are "rock-solid on cessation" of Iran's uranium enrichment program and want "objective guarantees" that Tehran's nuclear program is a peaceful one. Officials close to the talks said the EU-3 is considering Iran's proposal for a pilot facility, but possibly only to keep the discussions going.
Evgenii Mikerin, head of the FuelCycle and Nuclear Weapons Production Facilities Directorate at Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, says that the USopposition to the Russian-Iranian reactor deal stems from a desire to secure the Iranian market for itself. In support of his argument, Mikerin points to US intercession in NorthKorea, which resulted in the cancellation of a previously existing Russian-North Korean reactor deal. Mikerin stresses the particular importance of the Iranian deal as a means to keep Russian nuclear scientists, designers, and equipment manufacturers employed. According to Mikerin, Russia hopes to provide Iran with additional reactors and a complete fuel cycle in the future. According to Mikerin, Russia is to provide Iran with reactor fuel and reprocessing services, but Iran must accept the return of reprocessed materials,including waste products. The United States is threatening to terminate "certain bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements"and block Russian participation in the G-7 industrial forum unless Russia abandons the Bushehr deal. The United States is also warning Moscow that the deal could jeopardize current negotiations aimed at reaching a "broad nuclear cooperation agreement" for the creation of joint ventures to finance new Russian reactors. The cooperation agreement could also lead to the sale of up to $100 million in Russian nuclear equipment in the United States. Mikerin says that Russia would not work toward the implementation of disarmament agreements until the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission firmly settles issues surrounding the Iran deal. Once this has been achieved, Mikerin expects"an upswing in disarmament activities."
A report by Omid Suresrafil in the Tehran Times decries US proliferation hypocrisy as symbolic of its attempt to divert attention from its own nuclear stockpiles. Suresrafil elaborates that the United States has turned a blind-eye towards its main ally in the Middle East, Israel, regarding its nuclear stockpile. The reports further condemns the efforts of William Perry, US Defense Secretary, who was told by an unnamed Israeli military official on a trip to the Middle East in January that Iran could be capable of developing a nuclear weapon in five years. This anonymous source hinted at the possibility that Israel may repeat its action against Iraq in 1981 and attack suspected Iranian nuclear facilities.
Evgeny Primakov, the head of the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, states that, "Russia has helped and will help build the nuclear power plant in Bushehr." He also adds, "We are delivering reactors of the type the United States want to deliver to North Korea. We are working under supervision of IAEA. We exclude in our cooperation with Iran all the actions that might lead to the creation of the weapons of mass destruction."
Experts from Russia and China arrive in Tehran to work on Iran's civilian nuclear program, which the United States believes constitutes an effort to build weapons of mass destruction.
Experts in the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry say they doubt China is supplying Iran with uranium-enriching centrifuges. [Note: See 24 September 1995 entry for a report of China supplying Iran with uranium-enriching centrifuges.] Russian officials insist that the Chinese do not have the technology to build the centrifuges. Russia exported first-generation centrifuges to China several decades ago. In 1993, Russia agreed to build a centrifuge plant in China to enrich uranium for use in a nuclear power plant. Under the term of this contract, China is not allowed to export the centrifuges to a third country or to use it to produce materials for nuclear weapons.
F. Dawlatabadi, the head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's department for the CIS and Caucasus, says that Iran and Russia are considering a plan to expand their cooperation in nuclear power engineering. Dawlatabadi says that the cooperation between the two countries is peaceful and both sides are working on a new phase of cooperation with regard to construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Factory officials at a beryllium plant in Ustkamenogorsk, Kazakhstan, say that an Iranian delegation had visited the plant in August 1992 but deny that any sale took place. The British Broadcasting Corporation reports, however, that the Iranians purchased beryllium, a key component in nuclear weapons production, as well as 100 tons of uranium on that occasion.
Fayruz Hassini, Iran's representative at the United Nations in Vienna, denies allegations that Iran has stopped cooperating with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization. He says that Iran was among the first signatory countries. [Note: See 19 and 26 March 2002.]
Fernando Petrella, vice foreign minister of Argentina, says that so far,Argentina has stopped legal action by the government of Iran against Argentina over the breach of an $18 million contract for the sale of nuclear technology to Iran. [Note: See entries February1992; 2 March 1992; 1 October 1992; 22 September 1992.]
First Iranian Vice President Hassan Habibi inaugurates the Nuclear Medical Research Center at Karaj. The center is located northwest of Tehran near an Air Force base and large military industrial complex, and it is staffed with Chinese and Russian technicians according to Western intelligence. This center is supposed to be civilian nuclear facility devoted to nuclear medicine and agriculture. A cyclotron accelerator from Belgium's Ion Beam Applications has been installed at the site. [Note: See 1991 and February 1992 entries.]
Five days of talks yield an agreement on the UN resolution originally drafted by Britain, France and Germany. The resolution, passed today, makes no threat of UN Security Council referral, a fact welcomed by Iran. The final compromise text applauds "Iran's offer of cooperation and openness" but "strongly deplores" its past obfuscation efforts, in addition to warning against "further serious Iranian failures."
Focus calls Iran, as a country, the most active proliferate r of weapons of mass destruction in the world. Focus reports that the Iranian civil nuclear program is comprehensive, which could possibly lead it to make nuclear weapons. Iran's pledges that its nuclear program is peaceful are countered by Western intelligence sources stating that Iran is actively seeking to acquire "gas-ultra-centrifuges" that can be used for nuclear weapons production.
A report from the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry reveals that Russia will provide fuel to the Bushehr nuclear plant for the duration of its operation.
Following a ceremony, workers began laying the foundations of the steam power generator at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The work is first "executive move" by the Russian in building the plant following lengthy studies, surveys, and examinations, says Asadollah Saburi, the deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. He says 3,000 cubic meters of cement will be used in the foundations, which will be built by an Iranian engineering company under Russian supervision.
Following a meeting with International AEA Director General Hans Blix, Iran refuses to allow environmental monitoring of its declared nuclear facilities under Part I of the IAEA's 92+3 enhanced safeguards program. According to diplomatic sources, Iranian representatives at the IAEA General Conference were concerned that environmental samples from Iranian sites could be given to the United States and other "foes." The samples would be taken to detect nuclear activities at Iran's safeguarded facilities. However, deputy director general for safeguards, Bruno Pellaud, said samples sent to laboratories abroad would be kept anonymous. Pellaud added that any country conducting sample analyses would be prohibited from conducting analysis beyond the 93+2 guidelines.
Following a series of Jerusalem Post articles saying that Iran acquired nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union, two US Congressmen, Jim Saxton and Bill McCollum, say that they have closely followed Iran's military programs and that Iran "has obtained nuclear weapons as well as established a ballistic missile command-and-control system to launch them." They have called on the Clinton administration to form a new policy on Iran, in light of its nuclear weapons capability. The Congressmen's statements conflict with what the Defense and State departments allege about Iran's nuclear program. Saxton is chairman of the House Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, and McCollum is a former member of the task-force. Both say they have been receiving reliable information for years "that Iran has been obtaining nuclear weapon's parts and supplies from the former Soviet republics and Central Asia." McCollum says that Iran's policy indicates that "it already has nuclear weapons and is now trying to acquire a delivery system to launch them." McCollum supports his claims by citing the acquisition of ballistic missiles and the establishment and exercising of a distinct national-level command and control system as examples of Iran's capabilities.
Following closed hearings with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Chairman of the Russian State Duma International Affairs Committee Vladimir Lukin says any undesirable aspects of the nuclear deal with Iran are because the "Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom), while negotiating with Iran on the sale of light water nuclear reactors, did not consult either with the President or with the Government of Russia. As a result, it looked as if we signed the deal on behalf of Russia, though in fact it was signed on behalf of a specific ministry....I would like Minatom to sell as much of its products as possible, but so that our grandchildren don't have a group of nuclear states around Russian borders." According to an anonymous Duma member, Kozyrev says the deal for the centrifuge was secret outside of Minatom and was not known to Russian President Boris Yeltsin. [Note: See 8 May 1995 entry for an indication that US Secretary of State Warren Christopher believed Yeltsin did not know of the deal.]
Following reports disclosing that Iran is building additional nuclear plants in Arak and Natanz, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi rejects the allegations that Iran is concealing the building of these additional sites. He says, "The Islamic Republic of Iran's activities in this field are totally transparent, clear, and peaceful and there is no secret and obscure point on the launch of these (plants) in the future....[B]asically there is no possibility of concealing such centers." Mr. Kharrazi explains, "Iran wanted the two centers to generate part of its electricity needs....[B]y the next 20 years, Iran has to produce 6,000 megawatts of electricity by nuclear plants and the launch of these two centers are aimed to produce necessary fuel for these plants."IAEA director Dr. Mohamed El Baradei says that he learned of these facilities six months ago, three months before the Iranians officially notified him. He states, "The Iranians told me we could not visit the sites as planned this week because President Mohammad Khatami would be out of the country and 'they need some time to prepare'."White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, however, expresses concerns about the Arak and Natanz facilities, emphasizes that these facilities reinforce increasing US concerns about Tehran's "across-the-board pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile capabilities." He adds, "Our assessment, when we look at Iran, is that there is no economic gain for a country rich in oil and gas, like Iran, to build costly indigenous nuclear fuel cycle facilities... Iran flares off more gas every year than the equivalent power it hopes to produce with these reactors."
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi says since Iran does not intend to produce nuclear weapons, the uranium enrichment program will continue and there is nothing other countries can do to stop them.
Foreign Minister Kharazzi declares that nuclear fuels for sale were not actually currently available, although Iran certainly had the "capacity and the potential." He also confirms that Iran is in the midst of a research program for the development of a new centrifuge. Iran is being criticized for working within an apparently narrow definition of what it means when it suggests it has suspended its uranium enrichment program.
Foreign Minister Kharazzi discusses Iran's cooperation with the IAEA and the EU with the representative of the current EU presidency, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini. Kharrazi says that the IAEA report proved Iran's lack of a nuclear program and that Iran had been transparent in its dealings with the agency, adding that with its recent decisions to sign the additional protocol and suspend uranium enrichment, it was now up to Europe to fulfill its part of the agreement. Frattini commends Iran's recent positive steps, which have encouraged the EU to cooperate with Iran and "lobby for its nuclear program."
Foreign Minister Kharrazi suggests that the IAEA withdraw the Iranian dossier from the agenda of the Board of Governors meeting in September.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi announces Iranian acknowledgment of the European offer to replace plans for a heavy water reactor, but rejects the offer citing Iranian ambitions to become a major nuclear fuel supplier in the next 15 years.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi announces Iranian appreciation for the European offer to replace plans for a heavy water reactor but rejects it, citing Iranian ambitions to become a major nuclear fuel supplier in the next 15 years.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamidreza Asefi states that IAEA concerns are "purely procedural" and described the polonium research project as a "misunderstanding" that would soon be resolved. Asefi explained that the polonium research project was undertaken 13 years ago.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mahmud Mohammadi calls on India and Pakistan to "stop immediately their atomic tests and the nuclear arms race and to sign the international conventions on banning nuclear tests."
Foreign Report reports that North Korea is supplying Iran with nuclear know-how, technology, equipment, and materials such as enriched uranium.
Foreign Report reports that Russia and Iran are negotiating a "nuclear powered desalination plant" as part of the complex at Bushehr. The project, included in the January 1995 Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation agreement, would be the first of its kind outside of the former Soviet Union. Officials from the two countries have discussed the Russian APWS-40 desalination system and BN-350 reactor, produced by Russia's OKMB Mechanical Engineering.
A report in the Israeli daily Haaretz by analyst Danny Keshem alleges that the Czech firm Skoda Plzen is providing Westinghouse of the United States and Siemens of Germany with access to the Iranian nuclear market, thus violating "the restrictions imposed by their home countries on trade with Iran." Skoda spokesman Jaroslav Hudec calls the report "misleading" and says that except for limited cooperation on a very specific set of products for nuclear power plants, Skoda has virtually no other connection with Westinghouse. Hudec adds that Skoda is involved in talks with Siemens, but only pertaining to joint production of turbines.
Foreign Report reports that the Israeli Mossad estimates that as many as 10,000 Russians are helping Iran's unconventional weapons programs. The journal also reports that Israeli officials believe Russian scientists may have smuggled a supercomputer into Iran that could aid a nuclear weapon program.
Former chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix questions the claim that Iran was engaged in developing nuclear weapons, saying there was no "direct evidence" of this. He adds that Iran's civilian reactors were not, in and of themselves, a worry.
Former Iranian envoy to the IAEA Ali Akbar Salehi, cites significant progress in Iran's ability to use nuclear technology for agricultural, medical, and especially power generation purposes.
Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is preparing for a June 17th presidential election, affirms that Iran is "determined to have all branches of nuclear technology, including uranium enrichment...at any cost."
Former Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says "Iran is not seeking to arm itself with non-conventional weapons." [Note: See 14 December 2001 for a statement by Rafsanjani regarding nuclear arms.]
Former Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says that Iran has regularly paid its contribution to International Atomic Energy Agency. [Note: This statement is probably in response to a 20 July 1999 vote by the US House of Representatives to withhold funding for the IAEA.] He adds that Iran has called for a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East.
Former Iraqi nuclear scientist Husayn al-Sharistani is in Iran. He gives information [presumably to Iran] on Iraq's nuclear weapons program, information which is shared with Pakistan. Sharistani was previously imprisoned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for refusing to build nuclear weapons. [Note: He is also reported to be in Iran in 1992.]
Former Iraqi nuclear scientist Hussain al-Sharistani is seen in Iran. [Note: He was also seen in Iran in 1991. He was previously imprisoned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for refusing to build nuclear weapons but escaped.]
Former Iraqi nuclear scientist Hussain al-Sharistani says of Iran's nuclear program, "international conditions and Iran's present economic situation render a nuclear weapons program unfeasible. The Iranian nuclear program lacks scientific expertise, equipment, and nuclear installations." [Note: Sharistani was imprisoned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for refusing to build nuclear weapons, and then escaped during the Persian Gulf War. He was reported to be in Iran in 1991 and 1992.]
Four 82-ton water tanks are ready for delivery to the Bushehr nuclear power plant, says Nikolay Krivoshlykov, director-general of Atommash, the factory which built the tanks. They will be shipped to St. Petersburg and then by sea to Iran. The tanks are part of the reactor's emergency cooling system. The factory in Volgodonsk has an order for Bushehr worth $18 million.
Four men are arrested while trying to sell 1k g of uranium-235 in Batumi, Georgia. The leader of the group is Valiko Chkhivazde, a professional chemist. Shukri Abramidze, Leader of the Georgia Academy of Sciences Physics Institute's Atomic Center, believes the U-235 was destined for Iran.
France denies reports that it will supply Iran with highly enriched uranium pursuant to a possible secret addendum to the Eurodif deal. [Note: See 25 October 1991 and 29 December 1991].
A report released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council says Iran has two operating reactors that are suitable for plutonium production:the 5MWt reactor at Teheran University and the Isfahan NuclearResearch Center. The Teheran University reactor can produce600g of plutonium per year. Although the reactor's highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel could be used to produce a nuclear weapon, the spent fuel derived from it is low in plutonium content and therefore is not of proliferation concern. Toproduce sufficient plutonium for a nuclear weapon, Iran would have to set aside several years' worth of spent fuel, which i sin violation of its commitments under International AtomicEnergy Agency safeguards and the Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty. The Isfahan research reactor is only 27k W, and its output is insignificant. Three Iranian plants are suspected of conducting uranium enrichment research: the Sharif Universityof Technology, the Isfahan Nuclear Research Center, and theKaraj Nuclear Medical Research Center. IAEA inspectors believe that a calutron at Karaj is a 1 milliampere device, suitable only for medical purposes; including zinc separation. Incontrast, Iraq employed 600 milliampere calutrons for its nuclear weapons program. The Karaj calutron could be comparable to the China Institute of Atomic Energy's (CIAE's)F1 separator, which "has a beam operating in the range of hundreds of microamperes to several milliamperes." The F1 can enrich uranium to 36%, and is capable of separating lithium,potassium, rubidium, silver, neodymium, samarium, gadolinium,and erbium. Although the F1 is unsuitable for the separation of zinc, the CIAE's F2 and F3 versions, with "tens to hundreds of milliamperes of beam current," are believed to be capable of conducting zinc separation.
France loses a court case that it had brought against Iran for breach of a contract under which France was to construct two pressurized water reactors at Karun.
France's secretary general of the foreign ministry goes to Tehran to finalize the $1 billion Eurodif agreement between France and Iran. [Note: See 25 October 1991.] Further, France and Iran reach a preliminary understanding on the settlement of a disputed loan during the French Foreign Minister Francois Scheer's visit to the Iranian capital.
Frankfurter Allgemeine of Frankfurt/Main reports that, according to German intelligence sources, Iran aims to use Syria as a supplier route for its weapons of mass destruction programs. Syria is not subject to export controls as stringent as those against Iran, and has "fewer difficulties in the development of ultramodern mass destruction factories."
Frantisek Svitak, Vice President of Skoda Plzen Engineering Consortium in the Czech Republic, says the company is still considering trading with Iran in nuclear power technology, but will only do so through Russia.
Further indications of the split in Israeli thinking over Iran is indicated by two recent reports in the Israeli press. In the first report, Maariv presents four working assumptions regarding Iran's programs for weapons of mass destruction. The first is that sooner or later Iran will have the capability of launching long-range missiles with nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads. Second is that Iran is receiving aid in the development of these weapons from various countries including Russia, China, and North Korea. The third assumption is that the United States is the only country that can have a serious impact on Iranian arms development. And lastly, Israeli deterrence capability needs to be strengthened. Yifah Shapir, a researcher at the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies believes that Israeli officials overestimate Iran's technical capabilities. This tends to support US claims that Iran may not be able to integrate components received from various suppliers into a workable missile system.
A representative of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy tells ITAR-TASS that Russia is not going to curtail its nuclear power cooperation with Iran, in spite of such reports in some media outlets. The Russian representative said, "it will fully meet its commitments on the building of the first power unit of the nuclear power (NPP) in Bushehr....They say that the United States suggested to Russia exchanging of Iranian contracts for American contracts for the processing of nuclear fuel....The US suggestion is still a suggestion and nothing more, but we bear in mind that a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush."
Gad Yaacobi, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, says Iran devotes $800 million per year to the development of nuclear weapons. He warns that Iran has become "the main threat now" to peace in the Middle East.
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, says China is supplying Iran with uranium-enriching equipment. "There is no question that the supplies far exceed the needs of Iran's civilian nuclear industry," he says.
General Yuri Baluyevsky, Russian deputy chief of staff, says that Iran has received tactical nuclear weapons from a country other than Russia. [Note: He may be referring to Kazakhstan. See March 1993 entry.]
Gennadiy Kulik, Russian deputy prime minister, says Russia will fulfill its commitment to Iran to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Gennadiy Seleznev, chairman of the Russian State Duma, and Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Russia's Atomic Energy Organization, meet to discuss the development of ties between Russia and Iran regarding the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
A resolution being drafted at an IAEA Board of Governors meeting will include criticism of Iran for not disclosing all of its activities, with the intent thereby of precluding a possible move for sanctions.
Gennadiy Seleznev, Russian State Duma speaker, says nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran is based on the peaceful use of nuclear technology. The speaker affirms Russia's desire to help Iran set up a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East by stating, "We are vitally interested in the inadmissibility of spreading weapons of mass destruction in the region. The appearance of such weapons will not solve a single problem. It will, on the opposite, give rise to a complex of new one."
George Papandreou, the Foreign Minister of Greece who currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency, clarifies after a meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister that the EU has never claimed that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.
George Tenet, head of the CIA, says that Iran might be able to "produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by the end of this decade...Obtaining material from outside could cut years from this estimate." John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org says that there is no evidence that Iran is building a reprocessing facility to produce weapon-grade plutonium.
Georgiy Kaurov, a spokesman at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, says spent fuel at Iran's nuclear power plants will be relocated to Russia in accordance with the contract signed between the two nations.
Georgiy Kaurov, spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, says there were never plans to sell centrifuges to Iran. Nor has a decision been reached as to whether Iranian spent fuel will be transferred to Russia or left in Iran under International Atomic Energy Agency supervision. Mikhail Kokeev, a deputy in the Russian Foreign Ministry, adds that Russia would not advocate projects which would improve Iran's military posture, but admitted that several entities within the Russian bureaucracy had contemplated supplying dual-use technologies to Iran.
Georgiy Kaurov, the head of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry's public relations department, says that Iran has started paying Russia for building the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He says Russian technicians are preparing the site for construction, which is to begin in May.
Georgiy Matchitidze, an official in the Russian Embassy in Iran, says due to financial problems in Iran and the imminent Russian elections, construction of the Bushehr nuclear power station will begin in 1996, not December 1995 as originally scheduled. Although Iran has paid Russia $60 million to conduct a feasibility study, Matchitidze says Iran has to pay at least $50 million more for Russia to begin construction. A Xinhua report says that only seven or eight Russian experts are working in Iran, with the rest returned to Russia, having completed the study on technical conditions for the plant. However, Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran disputes the report.
A review of Iranian documents released to the IAEA has provides disturbing insights into a vast worldwide procurement network for Iran's secret nuclear program, over a 17-year period. According to U.S. and European sources familiar with the investigation, Pakistan appears to have been the source of crucial technology that would enable Iran to become a nuclear weapons power.
Sources in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry state that Iran is showing interest in acquiring advanced air defense technologies for the protection of the Bushehr nuclear facilities.
Georgy Kaurov, spokesman for Russia's atomic energy minister, announces Russia will build two more nuclear reactors in Iran in addition to Russia's $850million deal to build a 1,000MW nuclear power plant atBushehr. Kaurov says Russia "agreed in principle" with Iran on the construction of two more reactors at Bushehr. Constructionis not expected to begin for five years. This new deal was nota signed contract, but was rather a verbal agreement. VitaliyNasonov, a spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry(Minatom) says, "Russia will not sign any new documents with Iran until it has completed the contract to build the nuclear power station at Bushehr." He says Russia is not refusing to expand cooperation with Iran entirely, just "not until the21st century." Russia and Iran initially signed a contract on8 January 1995 for the first reactor at Bushehr. Russia took over construction of the reactor at Bushehr in February 1998due to delays by Iran. Kaurov says that Russia plans to speed construction of the current project and expects to finish the reactor in two-and-one-half years. Next, construction would start on two new 640MW power reactors, "which are still being developed." [Note: This seems to be the first mention of 640MWreactors at Bushehr. Previously, two 440MW reactors had been discussed for Bushehr.] An unnamed American official doubts Iran will have enough money to pay for the planned reactors."Whether they can get the first one done is iffy, and the chance of their completing the second, third, or fourth is highly unlikely," the official says.
Georgy Kaurov, spokesperson for the Russian nuclear energy ministry, says that "no nuclear warheads of the former USSR and currently at Russia's disposal were either handed over or sold to other countries." His announcement comes in response to an article in the Jerusalem Post that alleges that Iran received two nuclear warheads from Kazakhstan. Kaurov assures that "not a single [warhead] has disappeared."
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announces the "American administration very much supports this [EU] position." With talks currently deadlocked and Tehran refusing to give up enrichment, the Europeans insist the enrichment program must be terminated as an "objective guarantee" that Iran is not pursuing arms.
A Russian atomic energy official says Russia intends to sign contracts to build another three reactors at Iran's Bushehr nuclear energy plant. One would be the 1000MW VVER-1000 light water reactor and the other two would be the 440MW VVER-440 reactors, says the unnamed official of Russia's Ministry for Nuclear Energy. The official also says there is an understanding between Iran and Russia to train Iranian nuclear experts to use the Russian-made reactors at Bushehr, but he says "the understanding is only verbal and no documents have been signed on this score." [Note: See 4 May 1995.]
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder anticipates a successful outcome of the nuclear talks between Iran and the European Union stating the "common goal" is that Tehran renounces its availability of nuclear weapons.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder calls the agreement reached between Iran and three EU representatives as "good and important."
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder tells reporters that both he and U.S. President George Bush agree Iran "must waive any right to the production [of uranium] thereof, and they must renounce the right to even close the fuel cycle."
German news outlet DDP reports that a German company may have shipped material to Iran that could be used to make nuclear weapons. Bremen-based company J.C. Niemann reportedly shipped round aluminum rods without an export license. The Bremen Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating the matter for four years and is considering charges. [Note: The report does not state when the material was allegedly shipped to Iran.]
German police arrest a Spanish or Columbian national who arrived in Munich on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow carrying 300 grams of plutonium concealed in a metal box and "lead foil." After being told by the arrested man that two people, a Frenchman and a Spaniard, were waiting for him at the airport, German police were able to arrest them as well. According to another source, the man smuggling "between 100 and 300 grams" of plutonium is a Spanish businessman named Javier Bengoechea Arratibel. The source also said that Bavarian police had arrested a "Columbian and two Spaniards," and that those arrested were not part of "an international terrorist group". According to an article in Der Spiegel, confirmed by police spokesman Fritz Dillinger, approximately 2.2l bs of lithium 6 were seized as well. Officials with Bavaria's special police services believe that the illegal shipment "could wind up in an Arab country's embassy." Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran have been named as possibilities. Russian Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Sidorenko was also on the Lufthansa flight.
Germany creates "coordination agency for Iran" in Cologne's customs investigation office. This agency will monitor "suspicious 'Iranian-controlled firms in Germany'." German customs officials are currently investigating 10 organizations for illicit sales to Iran.
Germany refuses to resume construction of the 80-percent-complete Siemens-built nuclear power plant at Bushehr for fear that it could be accused of helping advance Iran's nuclear weapons program.
Germany says it will deny requests from Siemens and from Iran to approve export licenses for components for the Bushehr reactors in Iran. Siemens denies reports that it will rebuild the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Germany, France, and Britain's foreign ministries have release identical statements criticizing Iran's announced plan to start up a uranium enrichment facility in Isfahan, saying it "sends the wrong signal regarding Iran's readiness to implement a suspension of its activities." UN ambassador Pirooz Husseini rejects the criticism, saying "the plant is a totally separate issue from out commitment to the suspension of uranium enrichment;" he added that he would be discussing the situation with the three European representatives in the next few days.
Germany, France, and Great Britain decline to reply to a list of Iranian demands that includes access to advanced dual-use nuclear technology, removal of restrictions on Iranian nuclear sales, agreement to sell conventional weapons to Iran, assurances regarding the Europeans' commitment to Iran, and support for a nuclear-free Middle East.
Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND) says that Iran's nuclear programs focus on all phases of the fuel cycle. Iran is a "center of proliferation activities," even though no proof of any Iranian nuclear bomb exists.
A Russian delegation led by Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Reshetnikov visits Tehran to partially renegotiate the January 1995 contract providing for the construction of Bushehr nuclear power station's first unit in Iran. In particular, Minatom seeks to guarantee that Russian nuclear fuel burned in Iranian reactors will be returned to Russia as spent fuel for reprocessing. According to the contract, Russia will begin supplying fuel when the power station is completed in 2001, and will continue for 30 years. The installation of the Russian VVER-1000 [1000MW] reactor, shipment of the fuel, and loading the fuel into the reactor will be under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Intending to develop closer relations with Russia, Iran expresses interest in building a second unit at Bushehr using another 1,000MW VVER-1000 light water reactor (LWR), and a third and fourth unit employing 440MW VVER-440 reactors. Successful talks may prompt amendments to the original contract, potentially raising the contract's estimated cost to over $800 million.
Germany's Leybold AG sharply tightens its export controls on nuclear-related items, virtually prohibiting the transfer of dual-use items to Iran. Leybold checks with German and US authorities and investigates its potential buyers before making a sale, and through use of databases it seeks to identify possible third-party front companies that might be attempting to buy items for threshold states.
Gholam Aghazadeh, Iranian Vice-President, states after talks with the Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian Atomic Energy Minister, that he is hopeful that Russia will begin to supply Bushehr with nuclear fuel. Mr. Rumyantsev says that Russia will supply one load of 500 kilos of nuclear fuel from its Siberian storage facilities for the experimental launch of Bushehr and 10 loads of 500 kilos of nuclear fuel for the operation of the plant.
Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, Iran's atomic energy chief offers, Russia a chance to build more nuclear power stations in Iran. He states, "Beside Bushehr, we intend to build several more nuclear power stations with the overall power capacity of 6,000 megawatts, and we are offering Russia a chance to take up this opportunity."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (IAO) head, announces the completion of Bushehr power plant "will open a new chapter in Tehran-Moscow ties and will assure the Iranian nation and government that Russia is serious in expanding its ties with Iran." Georgiy Kaurov, ministry spokesman, tells Al-Hayah, that a tentative agreement regarding the possible construction of two more nuclear reactors for use as electric power generators, and a reactor for research use will be discussed.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), says Iran opposes nuclear tests by all countries. Aqazadeh says US claims that Iran is seeking to obtain a nuclear device are false, and that any program meant to develop a nuclear weapon does not exist. If the United States is serious about nonproliferation in the Middle East, Aqazadeh says, then it should limit its cooperation with Israel to develop nuclear missiles. At the same time, Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Minister of Nuclear Energy, reemphasizes the completion of the Bushehr nuclear power plant will not provide Iran with the means to develop nuclear weapons.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, meets in Russia with officials regarding the progress on the Bushehr nuclear power plant, bilateral cooperation on nuclear power plants, and upgrading existing nuclear cooperation. The two sides agree that the remaining work on Bushehr would have to go more quickly. A report on the plant will be given to the International Atomic Energy Organizaiton. Gholam Reza Agazadeh also says that 26% of the nuclear power plant is completed and that 25% of the station power engineering equipment has been installed.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that the construction of the nuclear power plant at Bushehr is on schedule and that the project has reached "a good technical level."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, met with Dr. Mohammed El Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and emphasized his willingness to continue close cooperation in the future. Mr. Aqazadeh says that Iran is willing to continue its cooperation with the IAEA in reaching an annual output of 6000MW of atomic energy and in conducting atomic sciences research work inside Iran. Mr. Aqazadeh emphasizes, "The expansion of Iran's atomic energy production capabilities is based on a precisely scientific, pre-planned basis, and Iran is determined to follow its objectives in full cooperation and harmony with the IAEA."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, assures Muhammad al-Baradi, the new Secretary-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), that Iran will follow all regulations dictated under the purview of the Agency in an effort to obtain information necessary to use nuclear technologies. In light of the fact that Iran will deplete its oil reserves in 20 years, Aqazadeh asserts, Iran must strive to obtain the necessary know-how in nuclear technology applications.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, informs reporters in Russia that Iran "has never tried to use Russian nuclear technology for military purposes." Agreements pertaining to nuclear technology transfers between the Iran and Russia, he asserts, are based on a doctrine of peaceful collaboration. This collaboration is finalized in a protocol concerning the agreement between Russia and Iran over the building of Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. He announces Iran's interest in building new nuclear power stations and facilities. Aqazadeh asserts that for nuclear power stations to be efficient they must have research facilities to act as an adjunct, "to ensure normal operation of the nuclear plant."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran will pursue cooperation with Russia and China because Iran "cannot let go of major investments" in nuclear technology. "Our oil and gas resources are limited and the use of atomic energy is necessary for us," he says. He says Iran wants to buy two additional 440MW reactors from Russia and two 300MW reactors from China.
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, Iranian Vice President and head of the Iranian Nuclear Energy Organization, says that Iran is not interested in nuclear arms production but seeks to acquire nuclear know how to generate electricity to meet its energy demands. He also says that Iran plans to build a factory for the production of uranium yellow cake. As he put it, "the [Iranian Nuclear Energy] Organization started its activities by drilling special wells in Arkedan of Yazd, where uranium reserves lie deep underground. It now plans to build a factory for the production of yellow cake." He also says, "With the completion of the Isfahan factory in the near future, we hope to complete the fuel cycle and indigenously produce fuel for our plants."
Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, Iran's vice president, announces he will meet with the chiefs of Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry in an effort to determine "a new timetable and to break the deadlock" regarding construction delays of Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran.
Gholam Reza Shafei, Iranian Ambassador in Moscow, says that Iran is ready to sign an agreement with Russia concerning the return of used nuclear fuel from Russia.
Gholam Reza Shafei, Iranian ambassador to Russia, and a delegation of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran visits the Ordzhonikidze plant near Moscow. The plant is building the fourth steam generator for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Thee first three generators have been shipped to Iran. Shafei says it is important for the project to be finished according to schedule. He says Iran hopes to be compensated for delays in construction of the plant.
Gholam Reza Shafei, Iran's ambassador to Russia, rejects the US accusations that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. He adds that the Iranian-Russian agreement has no military dimension and that the International Atomic Energy Agency regularly visits the Bushehr reactor.
Gholamreza Aghazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (IAEO), says the topics for future IAEA Board of Governors discussions were unpredictable, since "at present all the issues related with Iran are political."
Gholamreza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, announces the cessation of centrifuge building for uranium enrichment. UN inspectors have reported finding only "hundreds" of centrifuges, well below what would be needed to build nuclear weaponry. Aqazedeh states that Iran's voluntary action is specifically to engender international trust and confidence.
Gholamreza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, in his address to the 46th general conference of the IAEA, says that Iran, as a vanguard of advocates of nuclear-free zones, played an active role in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in 1974, in the UN General Assembly. He states, "The Islamic Republic of Iran, in line with the Islamic and humanitarian beliefs, has always fostered cooperation with the IAEA and has carried out all the scientific and research programs and civilian application of nuclear energy especially the Bushehr power plant in coordination with the international agency and its supervision." Mr. Aqazadeh says that in the next 20 years Iran has long-term plans to set up nuclear plants to bring its electricity output capacity of 6,000 megawatts. Mr. Aqazadeh mentions that Iran calls for transparency in nuclear programs and always condemns any country that may seek access to the weapons of mass destruction.
Gholamreza Shafe'i, Iranian ambassador to Russia, rejects Western media claims that Russia had retreated from its past positions as it related to cooperation with Iran. He states, "Contrary to such rumors, since last month, the Russians have actually become more serious about cooperating with Iran." With regard to the 10-year cooperation plan between Russia and Iran, the Iranian ambassador says, "The Russian government has approved of the plan and it has no intention of backtracking on the issue of cooperation with Iran.".... "The Plan will serve Russian interests even more than Iranian interests." He adds, "The atomic cooperation between Iran and Russia is aimed at making peaceful use of atomic energy and that is something that every country, even America, has approved of."... "The International Atomic Energy Agency has not observed even one case of wrongdoing at the Bushehr reactor."
Gholamreza Shafei, Tehran's ambassador to Moscow, announces Iranian readiness to sign the pending nuclear fuel agreement with Russia later this month. Mr. Shafei also confirms that Iran is "considering a moratorium, which means a temporary suspension, and not a full stoppage of uranium enrichment;" also that Iran is prepared to allow the IAEA to inspect, saying "if the agency's experts tell us two hours in advance they wish to visit this or that nuclear facility, they will have the permission." Referring to the United States, Shafei stresses that Iran does "not wish to get into conflict with anyone, [but] we will strongly defend our national interests."
Gid'on Frank, head of the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission, says there has been no change in Israel's nuclear policy. [Note: He may be referring to a 19 December 1997 article in the International Herald Tribune that Israel may puts its nuclear forces on high alert.]
Glenn Schweitzer, director of the National Research Council's Office for Central Europe and Eurasia, says he has met specialists in nuclear weapons-related fields, and some of them had tried to go to North Korea, some were working for China, and others were being recruited by India and Iran. Schweitzer suggests that the United States expand existing projects and create new ones that will provide cutting-edge research opportunities for nuclear weapons scientists in non-weapons-related areas.
Global News Wire reports that the German intelligence service, Bundes Nachrichten Dienst (BND), says Iran is attempting to build nuclear weapons at a site outside of Isfahan, Iran.
Goergiy Kaurov, the head of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry's public relations department, says that Russia is taking every measure to prevent misuse of Russian technology for military purposes.
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou says it is Iran's absolute right to use peaceful nuclear energy in the framework of international regulations and urged EU's cooperation with Iran.
Greenpeace International asks Iran not to "go nuclear" following nuclear weapons test conducted by India and Pakistan. Simon Caroll, nuclear and disarmament advisor to the Netherlands-based environmental and human rights group, says he "hopes that recent nuclear testings by India and Pakistan do not induce Iran and other countries in the Middle East to follow suit...though we have no evidence that Iran is moving in that direction."
A Russian delegation led by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and a US delegation lead by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher begin discussions on Russia's nuclear deal with Iran. Russian National Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev are also members of the Russian delegation. Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg Davydov says that Russia is compelled to cooperate with Iran because of its geographic location and because it is not in Russia's interest to have another "unfriendly neighbor in the vicinity of its southern border." Davydov denies reports that the United States had shown Russian officials an Iranian "blueprint" for nuclear weapons development. Instead, Davydov characterizes the report as an analysis which points toward Iran's intentions to "be closer to development of nuclear weapons." A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said that there was no substantiated evidence that Russian nuclear reactors in Iran were going to be used for non-peaceful purposes. The official said that Russian agencies "in charge of nuclear nonproliferation have the deal under their firm control" and that Russia has resolved "to leave no loophole for proliferation of nuclear weapons." The Russian-Iranian reactor deal calls for the completion of a nuclear power plant with a 1,880MW capacity. The Bushehr facility will likely have four reactors, the first with a 1,000MW capacity, the second with an unspecified capacity, the third and fourth reactors each with a 440MW capacity.
Haaretz of Tel Aviv reports that Israel and the United States failed to reach an agreement on how to induce Russia into halting its assistance to Iran to develop weapons of mass destruction. Haaretz reports Israel has suggested military action be taken against Iran, an action Israel has failed to convince the United States to take. Israel believes the time to strike Iran is limited and if Russia continues its aid, Iran will have ballistic missiles capable of mounting nonconventional warheads within 12 to 18 months.
Haaretz of Tel Aviv reports that Israeli intelligence believes Iran will be able to create a nuclear bomb by 2005, but this can be stopped if Russia stops providing assistance. [Note: See 24 August and 13 September 2001.]
Haaretz of Tel Aviv reports that the deal for Russia to supply Iran two additional 440MW nuclear reactors has been canceled because of financing difficulties. The Israeli daily further reports that as many as 1,400 Russians will work on construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Haaretz reports that an analysis by Professor Shay Feldman, due to appear in Update, the publication of Tel Aviv University's Institute of Strategic Studies, says, "It does not seem that Pakistan will transfer nuclear materials or sensitive nuclear technology to Iran or one of the Arab states." Feldman says the decision is based on Pakistan's desire to maintain its nuclear edge over Iran, which he believes will "constitute the undermining of its recently acquired advantage."
Haaretz reports that China's ambassador to Israel, Pan Zhanlin, asserts that China opposes the spread of weapons of mass destruction and would punish any Chinese company exporting such technology. This statement was in response to allegations of Chinese exports of arms technology to Iran.
After a meeting with Iranian Minister of Mines and Metals Eshaq Jahangiri, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko tells journalists that Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, would visit Moscow in August or September. Sources in the Russian government have reported that Aqazadeh will visit Russia to discuss cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Aksyonenko also tells journalists that Russian Prime Minister Igor Ivanov is planning to visit Tehran. Aksyonenko said, "we are ready to sign an intergovernmental agreement on scientific and technical cooperation."
Haaretz reports that Iran approached Israel through the United Kingdom to discuss nuclear proposals, such as not striking first, not arming missiles with nuclear warheads, and restricting long-range missiles. Israel refused to respond to the proposals, in part because doing so could acknowledge the existence of Israeli nuclear weapons. [Note: See 30 September 1999.]
Haaretz reports that Iran is considering the acquisition of a nuclear research reactor from India on the condition that India guarantees it will "uphold its commitments," according to Iranian National Energy Agency head Husayn Mashayqi. The Indian Atomic Energy Ministry, said Mashayqi, reneged on a proposal to build a research reactor in Iran during the 1980s.
Haaretz reports that Iran is trying to procure a nuclear reactor for research purposes from India. Hussain Mashayqi, head of the Iranian National Energy Agency, met in New Delhi for the conference of the International Agency for National Energy, where Mashayqi was quoted as saying "we greatly value our cooperation with the Indian nuclear scientists and we are willing to renew talks with them." He further promulgated Iran's adherence to the established rules of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), assuring that Iran's nuclear program is "completely transparent."
Haaretz reports that Russia has uncovered an Iranian network seeking to procure nuclear weapon technology. According to Viktor Posuvalyuk, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, the network comprises several students studying nuclear physics and missile science and one working through an Iranian embassy. Posuvalyuk says the effort to cut off the students' access to the information is an example of the Russian administration's continuing efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining information useful in developing nonconventional weapon systems.
Haaretz reports that, according to "Project Risk," a non-governmental organization that tracks weapons proliferation, Iran purchases prohibited and sensitive technology via front companies in the guise of charitable organizations. The most active is the Bonyad-e Mostazafin ("Foundation for the Oppressed"). Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres says that German organizations "are the most problematic" for selling sensitive technology to Iran. Peres says that the German government does not always actively try to stop illicit shipments to Iran. The United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency acknowledges a strong relationship with the German government, but says, "there are sectors of German industry that are more mechanized to help Iran's nuclear efforts."
A Russian diplomat says that the world community does not have any solid evidence that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.
Haaretz reports that, according to Israeli analysts, Iran is accelerating its attempts to acquire conventional and unconventional weapons. The analysts also report that Iran now needs significantly less time than was expected to produce a nuclear weapon. The reports also adds that Iran is doing all it can to achieve nuclear capability.
Hadi Najad-Hosseinian, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, on a visit to Washington, DC, says Iran would not abandon its nuclear weapons program. The Washington Times reports US intelligence services believe Iran has undoubtedly spent between $12-15 billion to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
Hamburg Stern reports additional details of Iran's European smuggling network, as provided in a German report on the Iranian Defense Industries Organization. German officials believe that Germany is the central location for the Iranian procurement network. This problem has been aggravated by the fact that Iran has received loans worth 5 billion DM from Germany and Germany appears unwilling to enforce laws concerning dual-use items. It is believed that part of these loans have been used to found a machine-tool industry in Iran. This program started in 1992 and is indicative of the ineffectiveness of the western embargo against Iran.
Hamian Vahdati, thought to be heading Iran's nuclear program, says that no country can be taken seriously without a nuclear research program, and that Iran wants to have the technology and knowledge to make nuclear weapons in case it needs them. Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Vaezi asserts that Iran opposes nuclear weapons buildup.
Hamid Reza Asefi, Foreign Ministry spokesman for Iran, says that despite the use of chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction against Iran, Iran "has never embarked on production of such weapons." The report comes after allegations by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that Iran is seeking foreign sources of technology to develop weapons of mass destruction. [Note: See 7 September 2001.] Asefi compares Iran's compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards with Israel's lack of transparency. "Iran's defensive and nuclear cooperation with some foreign countries are within the framework of international conventions, in line with the industrial and economic development of the country and aimed at maintaining world peace and security," he says.
Hamid Reza Asefi, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, announces that regardless of the outcome of current talks with the Europeans, Iran will resume uranium enrichment sooner rather than later.
Hamid Reza Asefi, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, says that contrary to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent statement, Iran is not seeking access to nuclear weapons. Asefi adds that Iranian-Russian nuclear cooperation is for "peaceful purposes" and that all nuclear programs are under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Russia is helping Iran build the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran.
Hamid Reza Assefi, spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry, denies that Iran has approached Israel through the United Kingdom with proposals on limiting nuclear weapons. "The Islamic Republic of Iran's talks with the British government concerned international disarmament and ways of confronting proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction," he says. "Neither in these or any other talks anything was raised to link these measures with the Zionist regime." The British Foreign Office also denies that it acted as an intermediary between Iran and Israel on the issue of nuclear arms. [Note: See 29 September 1999.]
Hamida Edalat, MP from Bushehr, says "it is not true that Russian experts are leaving Iran after pressures were exerted by America." She adds that "parts of executive operation that were to be handed over to Iranians according to the contract are being handed over and the Russian experts are leaving the country for this reason." Hamid Reza Asefi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, says there has been no change in Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation. Aleksandr Maryanov, Russian ambassador to Iran, says Russia will fulfill its obligation to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant. And "will be implementing in full all accords reached in connection with this project no matter what the prospects for expanding Russian-Iranian cooperation in the sphere of nuclear energy might be."
A Russian expert tells Interfax that Russia is abiding by international standards in cooperation with Iran. He states "we are tightening export control. Russia's conscience is clear ... Russia is not involved in creating a full nuclear cycle in Iran."
Hamidreza Asefi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, announces that Iran and Russia have no serious differences as concerns cooperation in the nuclear sphere. Talks during Russian Atomic Energy Minister Rumyantsev's upcoming visit to Tehran will focus mainly on "repatriating to Russia spent nuclear fuel originating in that country."
Hamshahri of Tehran reports that three mines with 800 tons of uranium reserves were discovered in Yazd Province, Iran.
Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, meets with Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, to discuss an agreement banning nuclear weapons. Rafsanjani praises the IAEA's work in promoting safety and arms control. Referring to Iraq, Rafsanjani says that merely signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is not sufficient. Some countries, he says, will not adhere to international regulations, although of course Iran will.
Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, says he has "no cause for concern" regarding Iran's attempts to acquire nuclear technology. But he says the IAEA may begin implementing special inspections for problem nations, with Iran as a possible test case.
Hans Blix, Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, inspects the Karaj Nuclear Research Center in Iran. He concludes the facility is for peaceful purposes only.
Hans Blix, Secretary-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, assures Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, that cooperation between the Agency and Iran will continue. He says, "I have always announced that no violation had been seen while conducting inspections in the Islamic Republic of Iran." Aqazadeh says Iran hopes to produce 20% of its power from nuclear power, an ambition he hopes will be aided by potential agreements with China and Russia.
Hans Blix, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), pays a secret visit to Israel for "professional consultations." A senior IAEA team is soon to go to Iran to investigate suspicions of Iranian centrifugal uranium enrichment plant.
Harvard University arms control expert Graham Allison says Israel and the United States have improperly characterized Russian ballistic missile technology transfers to Iran as a matter of deliberate Russian foreign policy. Allison believes that the transfers are instead the product of a combination of private Russian business interests and corrupt government bureaucrats. Allison believes that if it were Russian government policy to export weapons technology to Iran, complete missile and nuclear weapons systems would be transferred rather than components. Vladimir Orlov, director of the Center for Policy Studies in Russia, says that the effective implementation of Russian export controls is highly dependent upon the effectiveness of Russian customs officials.
Hasan Ruhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, says Iran is not building nuclear arms and that the International Atomic Energy Agency can investigate American allegations.
Hassan Rohani, head of the Supreme National Security Council, cancels a visit to Russia to discuss Iran's nuclear program. It is speculated that the cancellation is due to a coincident three-day visit to Moscow by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
Hassan Rohani, secretary general of the Iranian National Supreme Security Council, says that, "Iran will start operating its nuclear facility in Isfahan early next [Iranian] year." The Iranian calendar year starts on 21 March. The United States fears the uranium processing plant may be a part of a secret program to develop nuclear weapons.
A Russian foreign intelligence report says Iran has devised a way to dodge export regulations. Other reports refer to extensive Iranian efforts to procure fissile material.
Hassan Rowhani threatens to follow North Korea's lead if Washington refers Iran to the UN Security Council.
Hassan Rowhani, secretary of the Supreme National Council, states that Iran has no objections to transparency of its nuclear interests and hid portions of its legal nuclear activities due to "illegal sanctions" and an "increase in the number of embargoes," in the past. He further claims Iran has always taken initiative over signing disarmament treaties and sees creation of WMD an act that would weaken stability and security in the region and world.
Hassan Rowhani, secretary-general of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, says "If such an attack [by the United States] takes place then of course we will retaliate and we will definitely accelerate our activities to complete our fuel cycle and make nuclear fuel." On the same subject, Qolamreza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, states that if, for example, the Bushehr nuclear power plant were to be attacked by Israel or the United States, Iran is "capable of restoring everything in the minimum time."
Hassan Ruhani, deputy speaker of Iran's Majlis (Parliament), says that Germany should pay Iran "18 billion marks related to the Bushehr nuclear court case."
Hassan Ruhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, says that Iran will respect the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Head of Iran's parliament foreign policy commission, Alaeddin Borujerdi says if the Europeans insist Iran permanently suspend uranium enrichment, "it will be our last nuclear negotiation with them [Europeans]."
Hennadiy Udovenko, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, says it will look into participation by the Ukrainian company Turboatom in the Russian-Iranian contract for the construction of a nuclear power plant in Bushehr, Iran.
A Russian Foreign Ministry official says Russia will not recall its nuclear experts from the Bushehr nuclear power plant, despite fears expressed by US State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns that they could be a source of "leaks of information on nuclear military technology." The unnamed diplomat says such leaks are prevented by the procedure Russia uses to select nuclear experts to send to Iran as well as the peaceful nature of their work in Iran. "It is more in the interest of Russia than...the United States that no new nuclear states should appear along the borders of Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States," he says.
Hoping that Iranian dissident groups will mount a coup against the Iranian government before it develops nuclear weapons, some senior officials at the Pentagon are suggesting widespread covert operation against the Iranian regime.
Hossein Mousavian, a chief Iranian nuclear negotiator, has allowed for the possibility of permitting IAEA inspectors to return to Parchin for further environmental samples.
Hossein Mousavian, a senior Iranian security official, has stated that Tehran may resume uranium enrichment in March if EU talks "fail to yield satisfactory progress." Regardless, Mousavian states that Iran will consider extending the enrichment freeze only until June and that the nuclear fuel cycle work would never be scrapped. However, "we are fully prepared for a comprehensive arrangement to give all assurances that Iran will not seek nuclear bombs."
Hossein Musavian, chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, announces an agreement has been reached with Russia to provide nuclear fuel for Iran's nuclear program. Musavian further says the United States and Europe did not have any "problems" with this cooperation.
Hossien Afarideh, Chairman of the Iranian Parliament's Energy Commission, says that the allegation of some politicians that the Russian-Iranian cooperation on nuclear energy for peaceful use has "a dual meaning are groundless." Mr. Afarideh emphasizes that "every one knows that the nuclear power plant in Bushehr is being built for energy production purposes only....Moreover, the construction of the power plant has been monitored by the IAEA experts."
Husayn Afarideh, head of the Iranian Majlis Energy Commission, calls upon the International Atomic Energy Agency to prevent propaganda against Iran's peaceful nuclear programs. In a meeting with Werner Burkart, IAEA deputy director, Afarideh points out the IAEA positive reports about Iran and the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear program. Afarideh invites Burkart and IAEA high officials to visit nuclear facilities in Iran, including Bushehr.
Husayn Afarideh, head of the Iranian Majlis Energy Commission, says that the International Atomic Energy Agency has planned 70 visits to the Bushehr nuclear power plant during the next year. He adds that the construction of the plant is going well and that about 1,000 Russian experts are at the site.
Husayn Afarideh, head of the Majlis energy commission, says that the construction of the Bushehr nuclear reactor will be undertaken under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Melissa Fleming, spokesperson of the IAEA says that IAEA representatives have visited the nuclear plant before and that once nuclear materials are supplied to the plant, four to six visits will be carried out a year.
Husayn Musavian, Iran's ambassador to Germany, refutes allegations made by German intelligence that Iran was buying nuclear material. He says that Iran is ready to cooperate with Germany in curbing nuclear proliferation.
Hussein Mussavian, deputy Secretary of National Security in Iran meets with head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Sergey Lavrov, and Sergey Kislyakov, Deputy Foreign Minister on Non-Proliferation of WMD to prepare a list of documents on an "agreement about mutual protection of secret information and protection of intellectual property, exchanged within the time frame of military-technical cooperation." Sirus Nasseri, an Iranian delegation representative, says Iran is growing impatient with the negotiation results and wants to focus on getting Russian support for continuation of its program of "peaceful atom."
IAEA adopts a resolution to urge Iran to comply with their requests for full transparency by the end of October.
IAEA Chief ElBaradei criticizes the EU draft resolution on Iran as inadequate, a view echoed by the United States.
IAEA deputy director General Pierre Goldschmidt announces that results from the inspection of five Iranian nuclear sites in early January found no "suspicious equipment."
IAEA Director General ElBaradei circulates his report on the agency's nuclear verification in Iran. He praises Iran's cooperation with regard to site access especially, but expresses dismay at the dearth of "prompt information." He describes the P-2 centrifuge discovery as a "setback" and expresses the hope that it would be Iran's last oversight with regard to program disclosure. ElBaradei also suggests that a "comprehensive" suspension of centrifuge manufacturing and assembly would be a good confidence-building measure.
IAEA Director General ElBaradei, speaking in Brussels, suggests that Iran is being more cooperative than in the past and that nuclear program verification in Iran is "moving in the right direction."
IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei wants Iran to sign on to the Additional Protocol of the NPT to allow the IAEA inspections at any time. "If you have nothing to hide, there is no reason not to be transparent."
IAEA Director Mohammad ElBaradei, calls on Iran to provide additional documents relating to its nuclear program. The head of the IAEA said the request was to "make up for a lack of confidence created by years of concealment," but also stressed there was no proof Iran is attempting to build nuclear weapons.
IAEA Director Mohammed ElBaradei says Washington "would have to step in" as Tehran needs security guarantees beyond those given by the EU. "I think that when the issue of security comes up, obviously the United States will have to step in, because... the Iranians will very much need the American and not just European assurance," he said.
A Russian intelligence officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that it was "totally unfeasible" for Iran to build a nuclear weapon. He says that Russian and other foreign intelligence estimates put an Iranian nuclear weapons capability at least 10 years in the future. The intelligence officer said that the world community could control Iran's nuclear development, and prevent it from gaining access to nuclear weapons. The officer responds to Western and Israeli criticism about Russia's role in the project to construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr by saying that Russia had more to lose than the critics of the project did. "Our country, due to its geographic proximity, should be more alarmed by the prospect of nuclear weapons in Iran than Israel," he says.
IAEA Director-General ElBareidi says he hopes to have the report of the Iranian documents on whether they complied with IAEA demands out in about two weeks.
IAEA Director-General ElBareidi states that Tehran has refused to cease its uranium enrichment.
IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBareidi flies to Iran to attempt to avert an international crisis over its alleged nuclear weapons program. "The key issue is the enrichment program to make sure we have seen all nuclear experiments that have taken place in Iran; that we have seen all the nuclear material in Iran," says Dr. ElBareidi to Guardian reporters.
IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBareidi says he has been assured of Iran's willingness to cooperate and speed up the process of answering all of IAEA's questions on its activities during his visit to Iran.
IAEA Head ElBareidi says, "[Iran] has promised information will be forthcoming but it has not yet been provided. The central question is whether Iran has any [uranium] enrichment activities that we have not been informed about. On that question I haven't got satisfactory information." The statement is made as Iran is fast approaching the 31 October deadline.
IAEA Head Mohamed ElBaradei sets expectations as a team of senior IAEA inspectors prepare for their visit to Iran on 2 November. ElBaradei reassures that the 31 October deadline is "decisive and non-negotiable."
IAEA inspectors arrive at the Parchin base near Tehran. Hossein Mousavian, a member of Iran's nuclear negotiations team, stresses the inspectors' partial access to the site: "It is not necessary for the inspectors to enter the installations. They are authorized to take samples outside (the buildings) using their equipment."
IAEA Inspectors find traces of highly enriched uranium (HEU) at Iran's Natanz nuclear plant. Iranian officials claim the traces came from equipment imported from "another country" [unidentified] which included centrifuges used to enrich uranium and machinery associated with them. Mark Gwozdecky, a spokesman for the IAEA says Iran has "a large and sophisticated nuclear program".
IAEA inspectors seek access to two secret Iranian military sites. Intelligence data suggests the Iranian Ministry of Defense may be working on atomic weapons there. The information is based on satellite photos indicating testing of high explosives, and procurement records showing the purchase of equipment that may be used for uranium enrichment. The two sites are the decades-old Parchin military complex, southeast of Tehran, and a newer facility, Lavizan II, built in northeastern Tehran. Information on the second site was provided by the Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance to Iran (NCRI).
IAEA receives comprehensive documents from Iran on its past nuclear activities.
IAEA Spokeswoman Melissa Fleming says, "There are two phases to our work. The first phase involves Iran providing all the information to us on unresolved questions no later than October 31." The second is said to involve the verification of the information provided by them. IAEA stands firm on the deadline.
IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming states that the IAEA has conducted several inspections in Iran since Mohamed El Baradei's last visit to Iran in February. Ms. Fleming also reveals that various swipe samples have been gathered by the inspectors and are currently being analyzed by the agency.
IAEA talks stall with regard to a U.S.-backed resolution condemning Iran for its alleged nuclear weapons development activities. Non-aligned states hope to integrate praise for Iran's cooperation efforts thus far.
IAEO Director Gholamreza Aqazadeh complains that nuclear negotiations with the European Union are slow and not up to Iran's expectations, a subject he is broaching in his meetings with EU officials in Brussels. The European Union insists that the negotiations are "on track" and moving quickly enough. Aqazadeh described his meeting with the EU's Javier Solana as positive however, adding: "The next round of negotiations between Iran and the EU will be more intense and more realistic."
IAEO head Rohani, speaking in Tokyo, states that Iran would accept nuclear verification teams into the country again after March 27th. IAEA head ElBaradei declared confidence that progress in the Iran case would be made, and that the "ball is clearly in Iran's court" in any attempt to absolve it of possible military intentions attached to its nuclear technology and research.
Igor Ivanov, Russian Foreign Affairs Minister, rejects US allegations that Russia has supplied dual-use items to Iran.
A Russian minister accuses the United States of hypocrisy in criticizing Russian sales of nuclear technology to Iran, while ignoring similar activity by western companies. Alexander Rumyantsev says, "We also have complaints against the United States....It is always criticizing us, but its close economic partners supply Iran with sensitive technology."
A delegation of officials from Russia's nuclear industry goes to Tehran to discuss payment for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Sources say $700 million will be paid in cash and $300 million in barter goods, mostly food. The rights to import the barter goods have reportedly gone to Imperial bank, with ties to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Stolichny bank, with ties to Moscow Mayer Yury Luzhkov and National Security Advisor Boris Berezovsky.
Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, says that Moscow and Tehran are following a peaceful collaboration in the use of nuclear energy.
Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, says that the construction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr concerns only Russia and Iran. No other country has any influence on the construction process, he says. He discards fears that Russia might yield to US pressure to suspend the construction of the nuclear power plant. The Iranian vice-parliamentary speaker says that Iran has made its relations with Russia a "priority" and that progress on Bushehr demonstrates that both countries have rejected US pressure. Russian Power Minister Yevgeniy Adamov says that construction on Bushehr is "developing dramatically" and that it is "gradually entering a timetable which was largely directive but which is more and more becoming an actual timetable of meeting out obligations."
Igor Sergeyev, adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, says Russia is not assisting Iran in developing nuclear weapons. "To obtain weapons from the light water reactor in Iran is impossible," he says.
Ilja Mazanek, the director of Czech Republic's Foreign Ministry's Middle East and North Africa department, says that the Czech Republic is not exporting any weapons or components for nuclear power plants to Iran.
In a bilateral meeting with Russia on nuclear energy, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, Yuji Miyamoto, the ministry's director general for arms control and scientific affairs, says Japan is opposed to Russia's deal to build a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In a commentary following the decision to approve the Comprehensive test Ban Treaty (CTBT) at the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian representative Sirus Naseri expresses his doubts that the approval of the treaty could carry the same commitments and guarantees [presumably as it would carry if it were approved in the Conference on Disarmament]. He says that while Iran agrees with the general principles of the treaty, Iran's final agreement remains dependent "on the way it is submitted at the UN General Assembly."
In a commentary following the talks on nuclear disarmament in Geneva, Iran emphasizes its commitment to the eradication of nuclear weapons in its previous proposal that would require a record which would aid in the banning of the weapons as well as preventing the illegal transfer of nuclear technology for military purposes.
In a further indication of Turkish-Israeli strategic cooperation, analysts from both countries now believe that Iran will be able to develop nuclear weapons for at least 10 years.
In a joint press conference in Jerusalem with US Secretary of Defense William Perry, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin says "without foreign aid, Iran will reach nuclear capability within seven to 15 years." Perry says that time could be even shorter if Iran gets fissile material from another country.
In a Kremlin meeting, Russian President Boris Yeltsin tells German Chancellor Helmut Kohl that Russia will supply equipment to Iran for its nuclear power station, but that it can be used only for peaceful purposes. [Note: Yeltsin's statement that it can be used only for peaceful purposes may refer to his imminent "cancellation" of the "military elements" of the nuclear deal with Iran. See 11 May 1995.]
A Russian official arrives in Iran to conclude an agreement to repair and complete the nuclear power plant in Bushehr in southern Iran. Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov says that he hopes that the contract to begin work on the power plant will be concluded within days.
In a meeting between Sayyidd Shamseddin Kharraqani, the Iranian ambassador to the Netherlands, and J.J. Voorhoeve, the Dutch Minister of defense, Voorhoeve praises the efforts put forth by Iran in the arena of nuclear disarmament and the abolition of chemical weapons. He adds that the Netherlands attaches a great importance to Iran's position in the international arena.
In a meeting between Willy Wimmer, the vice president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the Iranian Majlis Speaker Nateq-Nuri, Wimmer says that "the negative propaganda of the Western media, saying that the Islamic Republic of Iran is trying to access nuclear weapons, has changed international norms and criteria into a political weapon."
In a meeting in Tehran between President Khatami and IAEA Chief Mohamed El Baradei, Iran agreed to provide the IAEA preliminary information about any plans to build new nuclear facilities. The two leaders met after El Baradei visited a plant that is being built in Natanz. President Khatami says Iran would further cooperate with the IAEA to avoid any "misunderstandings," and states "we hope the Iranian efforts, which are legal and fair, will not become a victim of the discriminatory policies of certain countries. Dr. El Baradei stressed that if Iran signed the additional protocol, the country would dispel doubts about its nuclear ambitions. Iran has refused the additional protocol which would allow the IAEA to conduct snap inspections and give the agency freer access to nuclear sites with little prior warningâbut agreed to hold more talks on the issue.
In a meeting in Tehran with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Vaezi, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov says Russia will complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant "in due time."
In a meeting with German Ambassador Paul Maltzahn, First Vice President Mohamedreza Aref reiterates Iran's oft-proclaimed assertion of its legitimate right to pursue nuclear energy development for peaceful purposes.
In a meeting with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami in Iran, Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed Al-Baradi says Iran's nuclear activities adhere to international law and that cooperation between Iran and the IAEA has been good.
In a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin says, "We understand Iranian nuclear aspirations, and I can assure you that we are aware of everything because Iran is our neighbor. That is why we will not allow our know-how and technology to be used for the production of nuclear weapons."
In a meeting with Majlis (Iranian parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, the deputy chairman of the Duma (Russia's lower house of parliament) Artur Chilingarov, says that the cooperation between Russia and Iran in constructing the Bushehr nuclear power plant was a model of bilateral cooperation. Chilingarov also says that Russia is prepared to expand scientific and technical relations with Iran.
In a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev in Moscow, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin criticizes the sale of Russian reactors to Iran. In response, Kozyrev explains that the "peaceful" Russian-Iranian agreement complies with Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) requirements, and pointed out that, unlike Israel, Iran has signed the NPT. Consequently, Russian-Iranian cooperation poses no threat to Israeli security. "We have reliable information that Iran is not planning to make nuclear weapons," a Russian Atomic Energy Ministry senior official says in an interview with Interfax. After meeting with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Rabin says if the United States could not convince Russia to drop the deal with Iran, Israel had very little chance to do so. Israel is ready to make economic concessions if Russia cancels its nuclear contract with Iran, but Russian officials rejected this possibility.
In a meeting with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reportedly says China is cancelling a deal to sell two 300MW nuclear reactors to Iran. According to Iran's Foreign Minister Spokesman Mahmud Mohammadi, China is still interested in selling reactors to Iran, but the deal is suspended because of problems with the site's suitability. Qian says that the decision was made by China unilaterally, not because of US pressure. Russia expresses its concern that the United States may use China's decision in order to push Russia to also cancel its deal with Iran.
A Russian official comments with regard to Washington opposition to Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran: "It has become quite clear for Russia that the US is seeking to protect and expand its economic and political interests. Russia is also pursuing the same course and has adopted the same policy. For ages, Russia has had relations with these three countries and it would be foolish if Russia were to suddenly decide to sever all its contacts and matters with them merely for the sake of Washington's interests. Russia cannot give such a costly gift to Washington."
In a move to emphasize what Israel believes is a dangerous matter, Natan Sharansky, Israel's Industry and Trade Minister, asks for promises from Sergey Kiriyenko, Russia's Prime Minister, that Russia will not provide missile technology to Iran. Kiriyenko assures Sharansky that "within the framework of our cooperation with countries in the Middle East and elsewhere, we will take no step that might affect Israel's security."
In a news conference after a meeting with workers from the Turboatom plant in Kharkov, Yevgeniy Marchuk, the former Ukrainian prime minster, announces the decision of the Ukrainian government to cancel the turbine deal for the Bushehr nuclear power station is not final. Marchuk believes the decision was "short-sighted" and says he will provide political backing to counter allegations of any wrong-doing. Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian president, counters these remarks at a press conference in Sofia, stating that Ukraine will adhere to the agreement on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Kuchma asserts that discerning Iranian government intentions regarding nuclear technology is difficult. He believes caution will best serve the Ukrainian administration. Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, asks for a definitive answer from the Ukrainian government regarding its involvement with the Bushehr plant in southern Iran. Ukraine vows to provide an answer within a week. [Note: See 6 March 1998 entry for Ukraine's original announcement that it will not participate in Bushehr.]
In a press conference in Moscow, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Alexander Rumyantsev states that his Ministry believes that new nuclear power units in Iran may be build in the distant future. He mentions, "We can only speak of the construction of new nuclear power units in Iran in hypothetical terms... Russia is building one unit in Iran today, and there have been no agreements on the construction of another so far." As for possibility of building an additional power unit at Bushehr, Mr. Rumyantsev says, "it would be more expedient to build a new power unit at a new site instead of adding to a facility left by the German Siemens company, which initially planned two units."
In a press conference in Moscow, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Alexander Rumyantsev states that Russia and Iran have finalized a contact on fuel supplies for the nuclear power plant in Bushehr. Mr. Rumyantsev also mentions, "The text of the contract is currently being analyzed with the Russian Foreign Ministry....Russia commits itself to supplying Iran with nuclear fuel, and Iran commits itself to returning it....We hope this contract will be signed within a month."
In a rare interview, Vice-President Dick Cheney states repeatedly that the United States is backing an EU initiative to persuade Iran to freeze its nuclear ambitions, while stressing that no option as been eliminated. Secretary of State Rice tells Iran that in order to avoid Israeli ire, it needs to "live up to international obligations." Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld suggests that Iran is actually "years away" from building a nuclear bomb and President Bush advocates a diplomatic path.
In a rebuttal to a recent statement by Israel that German intelligence had uncovered Iran's attempts to acquire materials necessary for the production of nuclear weapons, the Iranian embassy releases a statement to reiterate its attitude toward nonproliferation. [Note: See 22 July 1995.] The Iranian statement declares that unlike Israel, Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and that it is an active member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It adds that, unlike Israel, Iran's nuclear installation have been under IAEA supervision, and that Iran has been active in asking that the Middle East be declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
In a sermon made at the Friday prayers in Iran, Iranian President Rafsanjani says that the United States is opposed to Iranian advances in the field of nuclear technology because its concern that the nuclear power plant at Bushehr will be converted for the production of plutonium for atomic weapons. He questions the legitimacy of the United States as moral authority to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons when the United States is the only country to ever use the atom bomb on any country. Iran, he says, is using this advanced skill for the production of medicines. He also states that the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announces a few times each year that there is no evidence that Iran is attempting to manufacture nuclear weapons. He also clarifies the incident that had taken place at the thermal power plant. [Note: See 24 and 31 July 1996 entries.] He explains the radioactive contamination as a safety kit containing a radioactive core breaking and a worker picking it up got contaminated. He explains this incident as something that could occur in any sensitive industrial installation, and accuses "mischievous propaganda" charging that a "nuclear incident had taken place in Iran."
In a speech at the London Royal Institute of International Relations, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen says that China's sale of two 300MW nuclear reactors to Iran has not been cancelled. Qichen's statement refutes the US claim that the deal had been terminated. [Note: See 27 September and 2 October 1995 for US statements that the deal had been cancelled.] Qichen reiterates China's support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and emphasizes that China will not help other countries develop nuclear weapons. According to the Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran, US officials misinterpreted Qichen's statement that the deal had been suspended; Qichen only meant that a suitable site for the reactors had not yet been found. [Note: See 29 September for a similar statement by Qichen.]
A Russian official denies reports that Russia has agreed to sell Iran a uranium-enriching gas centrifuge facility. "No contracts or agreements on this question have been signed," says Georgiy Kaurov, head of the information directorate of the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy. "And you can have discussions on any subject, and in this instance these are just empty words." Another Russian nuclear official says Russia is discussing with Iran the training of Iranian nuclear physicists, but no agreement has been signed. "Most of the Iranian nuclear physicists have undergone training in the West," explains Lev Ryabev, Russia's first deputy minister for atomic energy. "It would be natural if they learned to operate Russian-made equipment which will be installed in Bushehr. Ryabev says Russia has started no construction yet at the unfinished nuclear power plant: "We have not laid a single brick in Bushehr yet."
In a speech at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, Iranian Foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati proposes that the Persian Gulf States create a forum for the discussion of security issues, including a commitment to forswear nuclear weapons acquisition and establishment of a weapons-of-mass-destruction-free zone in the Gulf region.
In a speech to the International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference, Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, claims that Iran's nuclear program is completely peaceful, that Iran is the first country to promote a nuclear-weapon-free zone for the Middle East, and that creating such a zone will be put on hold until Israel cooperates on nuclear issues. Amrollahi also says that Iran's adherence to IAEA safeguards is clear and that Iran took the initiative of inviting the IAEA to visit Iran's nuclear facilities.
In a statement agreed to at a meeting in Luxemburg, European Union foreign ministers back the calls of the IAEA for Iran to adopt the additional protocol of the NPT and allow more intrusive inspections of its nuclear program.
In a statement before the USSenate Foreign Relations Committee Subcommittee on NearEastern and South Asian Affairs, a spokesmen for the StateDepartment says that Iran "has demonstrated a determined effort to develop and acquire weapons of mass destruction(WMD), ballistic missiles capable of delivering them, and dangerous advanced conventional weapons." In the statement,State Department officials David Welch and Robert Einhorn note that Iran has "dedicated civilian and military facilities and technologies that are inconsistent with a purely peaceful nuclear program." The officials said the United States has approached a number of supplier governments bilaterally to prevent such transfers. Most governments, they said, have chosen not to pursue any peaceful nuclear cooperation with Iran, "with Russia and China being notable exceptions," since such cooperation could be used to further Iran's nuclear weapons program. Because of Iran's effort to develop WMD and associated delivery systems, and its continuing support for terrorism, Welch and Einhorn say the United States has combined nonproliferation and anti-terrorism efforts with economic and political pressure. However, they added, "currenttoolseconomic sanctions such as the Iran and Libya SanctionsAct and the president's embargo, the missile and CBW sanction slaws, the Iran-Iraq Nonproliferation Act, and the many nuclear sanctions laws teach the limits of effective unilateral initiatives." The statement says that US policy would be more successful if the United States had cooperation from it sallies to use "our common political and economic clout to have a real tangible impact on Iran."
In a statement released by the Foreign Ministry, Iran acknowledges having secretly bought nuclear parts via international sources, although it continues to insist that its goal is electricity production versus nuclear weapons. Iranian Spokesman Hamidreza Asefi reiterates that all such purchases have been reported to the IAEA.
In a surprising twist, Russia's Atomic Minister offers the United States the choice to join Russia in building an Iranian nuclear power plant. Russian Minister Rumyantsev says, "There is enough place for everyone....We have made this proposal to our American colleagues several times during discussions on expert level, and they have been saying they need to think about it."
In a television interview, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov says Russia has received about $5 million so far for its work on the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. The work has consisted of inspecting the equipment left by the German contractor that stopped construction in 1979 and reviewing what reconstruction needs to be done to the cement foundation. Mikhailov says this stage should be finished by the end of October.
In a Washington press conference, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) reveals the existence two previously undisclosed uranium enrichment facilities west p f Tehran.
In addressing the 58th UN General Assembly session in New York, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi claims that Iran is adamant about following its peaceful nuclear program. "Iran's nuclear program is clearly for peaceful purposes, especially for generation of 7,000 megawatts of energy within framework of the national development plan's target by the year 2020."
In an address to the World Jewish Congress, US President Bill Clinton announces that he will ban all US trade with Iran, including purchases of Iranian oil by US firms, which last year accounted for over 20% of Iran's oil exports and totaled almost $4 billion. Also banned will be $326 million of direct US exports to Iran. The executive order is to take effect in the first week of June. Clinton also said he would press US allies to impose similar sanctions. In his speech, Clinton cites Iranian agreements with Russia to buy nuclear reactors and gas centrifuge equipment as proof that Iran is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. The embargo is reportedly a demonstration of US determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and is imposed on the basis that Iran is a terrorist state and is seeking weapons of mass destruction.
In an article for the Frontier Post, Dr. Jassim Taqui warns that India's Russian-based nuclear technology may provide Iran with a source to provide information and expertise regarding its own Russian-based nuclear technology.
In an editorial criticizing the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Tehran's Jomhuri-ye Eslami writes, "the policy of double standards by the IAEA and by the supporters of the Zionist regime [Israel] should not be ignored and taken lightly, because it has placed the entire region in peril." Incensed that the IAEA "intentionally ignore[s]" Israel's nuclear weapons program, the daily says, "it is not logically acceptable for nations and governments that have roots in the region that is, 'the true owners of the Islamic territories'âto be facing a nuclear threat, while a bunch of Zionist occupiers who have no roots in the region whatsoever are allowed to threaten others in order to ensure their own safety and to constantly add to their nuclear assault capabilities." The paper says that all nations should "force the Zionists to destroy their nuclear arms." [Note: The Iran Daily also criticizes the IAEA on 24 July 1997.]
In an effort to "remain committed" to the regulations promulgated by the International Atomic Energy Agency on nuclear nonproliferation, Iran says it will accept the Agency's supervision of the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
In an effort to convince Russia to end its nuclear cooperation with Iran, the United States temporarily ends plans to sign an agreement with Russia on the peaceful use of nuclear power. Hazel O'Leary, the US Energy Secretary, believes the threat from Iran is serious, stating Washington is resolute in its desire for Russia to end its assistance to Iran. But Washington's action has not provided the desired response, and Russia continues to deal with Iran, adhering to a $1 billion contract with Iran to complete a nuclear reactor in Bushehr within four years, with stipulations for a further three in the future.
In an effort to keep Russian scientists away from financially lucrative jobs in countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, the United States signs an agreement with Russia ensuring $30 million will be made available to develop conversion projects in the nuclear sphere.
In an effort to persuade Iran to abandon its alleged weapons program, Britain offers to build Iran a light-water nuclear reactor and supply it with other needed nuclear material
In an effort to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, 250 members of the European Parliament (EP) ask the European Union to keep its ambassadors out of Iran. Iran proposes the EP confer with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who they believe can assuage any of the EP's fears. The IAEA has repeatedly said Iran's nuclear program is peaceful.
In an exclusive interview with RIA Novosti, Hossein Afarideh the Chairman of the Iranian Majlis Energy Commission says that Russian-Iranian energy cooperation is not limited to the building of the Bushehr plant. He mentions that Russia and Iran are currently discussing project "Tabas," an opportunity to build Iran's first thermal power plant using natural coal. Mr. Afarideh also adds that the Iranian energy sector has significant potential, and that in addition to Russia, other European companies are also taking an active part in the oil and gas sector development. He states "we are currently cooperating with Japanese, German, and Italian companies."
In an interview at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, IAEA chief ElBaradei responded to the Bush administration's claim that he is "not tough enough on Iran." "It depends on how you define soft. The results in Iran are something I am quite proud of. Eighteen months ago, Iran was a black box...now we have a fairly good picture of what is happening. We understand how complex and extensive that program is."
In an interview on Iranian television, Mr. Dust-Mohammadi, technical affairs deputy of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says the planned location of two 300MW nuclear reactors to be built by China has been moved from Darkhovin to Bushehr. "The reason for choosing Bushehr," he says, "is its potential and plentiful water resources. This issue has delayed the implementation phase of the agreement." He says the primary reason for the delay in Iran's contract with China for the reactors was the question of location. [Note: See 29 and 30 September 1995 for more on the proposed location of the reactors. US officials have said China agreed to cancel the deal, but Chinese officials and Iranian officials have said it is on hold because of problems with choosing a site. See 27 September 1995.]
In an interview on Russian radio, Russian politician Ala Yaroshenskaya says a protocol signed by the heads of the Russian and Iranian atomic energy ministries called for signing a contract within six months to build a uranium mine and a uranium-enriching gas centrifuge in Iran. [Note: Yaroshenskaya's title is not given. If Yaroshenskaya's assertion of the existence of this protocol is true, the Russian and Iranian atomic energy ministries lied or were incorrect when they said they never discussed the sale of a gas centrifuge. It would also mean that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's agreement to cancel the sale of the centrifuge was not an empty gesture as Iran has alleged. See 11 and 12 May 1995.]
A Russian official refutes the suggestion of US ambassador to the United Nations Madeline Albright that Russia might forgo the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. "Russia will not cancel its decision, even in the face of threats from foreign countries," says Grigoriy Karasin, spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry.
US News and World Report reports that unidentified intelligence sources have claimed that scientists working in the Soviet Union's nuclear program in Kazakhstan sold weapons-grade uranium to Iran. Sources also say that Iran has set up five separate, competing units to work on the nuclear weapons program, and that it has divided the program into smaller projects so that the necessary technology can be acquired without detection by the West. Iranian President Rafsanjani requested the assistance of Kazakh nuclear scientists to help Iran "develop its nuclear capability" during a visit to Kazakhstan. A meeting was reportedly held between Kazakhstani experts and Reza Amrollahi, the Iranian deputy president for atomic affairs and the chairman of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, on the topic of giving aid.
In an interview published in Iran's Abrar newspaper, Iranian Deputy President Ayatollah Mohajerani says that because Israel "has nuclear facilities, the Muslim states, too, should be equipped with the same capacity," adding that "therefore Muslims should strive to go ahead" with nuclear development. Soon after Mohajerani's statement, the Iranian United Nations mission denies that the country has a nuclear weapons development program.
In an interview to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Nikolay Shingarev, head of the public relations board at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, assures the Israelis that Russia will not provide Iran with Nuclear weapons. He says "We understand Israel's concern and can assure it that we will not supply any equipment, know-how, or materials enabling Iran to obtain nuclear weapons." Mr. Shingarev adds, "We made sure that the uranium supply for the reactor would be closely monitored and that Iran would return the waste to us."
In an interview with a Russian newspaper, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Romyantsov confirms that despite US pressure, Russia and Iran are determined to continue their nuclear cooperation.
In an interview with a Russian television station, Mehdi Safari, Iran's ambassador to Moscow says that "as long as the Russians do not fulfill their initial commitment to complete, the Bushehr plant no new contract will be signed with them." Iran Daily also quotes Safari as saying "delays have occurred in this project, but we hope the Russians will carry out their responsibilities as planned." The Bushehr nuclear power plant was initially supposed to be completed by 2002, but Russian officials now say they expect the first unit to be finished by May 2003. Iran denies this report, however, saying that Iranian ambassador to Russia Mehdi Safari said that Iran might hold off on nuclear cooperation with Russia due to delays in the completion of the Bushehr plant. IRNA reports that the Iranian embassy told Interfax that "Iran, as before, is prepared to expand its cooperation with Russia in all fields."
In an interview with a Swiss news outlet, an Iranian nuclear official says Iran wants to develop its nuclear sector "for the production of energy, not for bombs." "Our power is not based on nuclear weapons," says RezaAmrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. "Wedo not want them [nuclear weapons] because we believe that they are no longer useful in today's world," he says. Askedwhy Iran needs nuclear energy with its vast oil reserves,Amrollahi says, "It is nothing but reasonable to develop all possible energy sources: water, solar energy, and wind....Wecannot burn all our fossil fuel reserves in power plants. Thiswould cause additional environmental pollution. In 20 years we want to produce 20% of our energy by nuclear means. There is something else: Why were the Americans not against it when the Shah built the nuclear power plant of Bushehr in those days?He was able to complete 85% of it without any objection....Whyis the United States putting pressure on Russia, while it spares no effort to help North Korea get new nuclear reactors?." Amrollahi says 200 Russian engineers and 500Iranian experts have been working on the Bushehr plant since last year. Amrollahi calls "absolutely wrong" reports that Iran sought from Russia a heavy water reactor, which would be more useful than light water reactors for weapons production.As for US assertions that Iran has tried to buy plutonium from Central Asian republics, Amrollahi responds: "What for? TheAmericans like to assert wrong things. If they have proof, Icall on them to submit it to the IAEA. The IAEA has al socalled on the Americans, but so far without success."Amrollahi denies that Iran has recruited nuclear experts in the former Soviet Union. "Russia is our contracting party," he says. "It is its task to take scientists and engineers to Iran. We do not interfere there." Amrollahi says Iran has a5MW research reactor in Tehran and a "small research reactor"in Isfahan, which he says is used for the training of staff.As for nuclear contracts with China, Amrollahi says China is to build two nuclear power plants, each with a capacity of300MW. "We are in the final stage of the technical preparation," Amrollahi says of the Chinese deal. "We have not yet started with the work on the spot." [Note: The date of the interview is not known.]
In an interview with a US television station, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani says that Iran "neither had nuclear weapons nor was it seeking to acquire or develop them."
In an interview with an Iranian newspaper, Isaqoli Ahmadinia, a member of the Iranian Majles energy committee, states that "Iran and Russia are currently discussing the construction of a second nuclear plant in Bushehr, but they have not signed a definitive contract....[S]i x power plants are being planned, estimated to be complete by 2012."
In an interview with Beijing-based new outlet Xinhua, Georgiy Matchitidze, counselor of the Russian Embassy in Iran, says construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant has been postponed until next year because of financial problems and elections in Russia. Iran has given Russia only $60 million, he says, the cost of the feasibility study. "We should need at least $50 million more to start construction of the project because we have to purchase equipment and related facilities of the plant," he says. Most of the Russian experts working at Bushehr have returned home after completing the feasibility study. According to an anonymous source, Iran had opened two letters of credit for Russia worth a total of $80 million. Russia had threatened to send home its 160 experts if Iran did not extend the letters of credit, according to the source. [Note: According to a previous report, Iran paid Russia $20 million for the feasibility study and opened letters of credit worth $60 million, a total of $80 million. This may be the $80 million mentioned above as the total of two letters of credit. See 20 November 1995. A report on 22 June 1995 said as many as 220 Russian experts were working on the site.]
In an interview with CNBC, John Bolton, undersecretary of state, says that Iran plays a leading role in the Bush administration agenda, and that Iran is seeking technological assistance from North Korea and China to enhance its weapons of mass destruction programs.
In an interview with Iranian television, Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, defends Iran's right, as a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to obtain nuclear technology from those countries that already have the technology under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He further states that the technology transfer is for the peaceful uses of that energy that would serve for the development of the recipient state.
A Russian official says the United States opposes the Iran-Russia nuclear deal because the United States does not want commercial competition. "Americans are ready to strangle any potential competitors in the market of advanced technologies," says Georgiy Kaurov, head of the information directorate of the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy. He notes that the reactors Russia plans to supply to Iran are the same type the United States plans to supply to North Korea.
In an interview with Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy, Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, cites the contradiction between US policy towards North Korea's reactor and the reactor in Bushehr as the reason why difficulties regarding reconciliation of differences over the Bushehr plant have been hard to resolve. Adamov says Iran's position regarding nuclear technology includes both nuclear weapon development and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Future talks between Gholam Reza Agazadeh, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran chairman, and Adamov will focus on peaceful applications of nuclear technology, specifically, the Bushehr plant and a research reactor with 20% uranium enrichment for Iran. Adamov refutes accusations that Russia will provide assistance for a centrifuge for uranium enrichment.
In an interview with Reuters, Vice President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Asadollah Saburi says that Iran needs assistance from Western experts to conform to international nuclear safety standards. He notes that Western sanctions on "dual-use" technology have prevented Iran from having high-quality assistance on nuclear safety: "We are deprived of quality supervision. Otherwise, we could have assured ourselves and the world of our operations' safety." The United States and Israel are committed to preventing Iran's pursuit of nuclear technology, as it could lead to the development of nuclear weapons. The US Senate voted last week to impose sanctions on any state that supplied nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons technology or equipment to Iran. Saburi denies that Iran seeks nuclear weapons: "I assure the world we are not doing anything against international conventions. Our operations are fully open and transparent."
In an interview with Russian Daily, Kamal Kharazi, the Iranian foreign minister, states Russia is fully aware that Iran does not seek to procure weapons of mass destruction, and that Iran-Russia cooperation is relegated to non-military use of nuclear energy.
In an interview with the English daily Tehran Times, Major General Mohsen Rezai denies Iran is involved in developing nuclear weapons, stating, "Political logic, morality, our own culture and above all the situation in today's world does not allow us to have such deadly weapons."
In an interview with the Russian television company NTV, secretary of the Russian Security Council and chief of staff of the President Nikolay Bordyuzha says, "We, the same as the United States, are not interested in Iran getting nuclear and missile technologies." He noted, "There is a commission on export control, which is headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov. Some organizing measures were taken for preventing the leakage of missile and nuclear technologies not just to Iran, but, in general, away from Russia."
In an interview with the Russian website Gazeta.r u, Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, states that the there is a ten month-lag in the Bushehr project. Mr. Rumyantsev mentions, "This is how things stand in Bushehr. As you probably know, there is a ten-month lag behind the schedule related to objective reasons when the construction was suspended. We are trying to make up the lag but are not managing to make it up in one go. From the point of view of the adjusted schedule, things are going well and I intend to visit Iran in the near future. We are also training local cadres; these people are undergoing training starting with creating the station's equipment where we are building the nuclear facilities. They will not send for us for repairs but will roll out a national base in their own country. Where will the processed nuclear fuel go from Iran? We actively guided through the summer amendments to our legislation for this reason and we now have a legislative basis for supplying fresh nuclear fuel abroad and collecting the processed fuel. Thus, Russia will meet all its international obligations on the nonproliferation of nuclear materials."
In an interview with the Times, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon calls on the international community to target Iran as soon as the imminent conflict with Iraq is complete. He says, "one of the things I mentioned is that the free world should take all the necessary steps to prevent irresponsible countries from having weapons of mass destruction: Iran, Iraq of course, and Libya is working on a nuclear weapon....I talked about these things with Vladimir Putin a few days ago and I have been to Washington and one of the things I talked about was what will be [sic] later, if Iraq is going to be disarmed."
In an interview, US Secretary of Defense William Cohen says that China has been exporting [nuclear] technology to the Middle East, particularly to Iran. Cohen notes that China will soon become a net oil importer, and thereby will have more of an interest in the stability of the Middle East. He also notes that Iran is trying to develop more sophisticated chemical, biological, and, possibly, nuclear warheads.
In an interview, Vladimir Slivyak, co-chairman of Ekozashchita, says in signing the contract to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant, "Russia assumed obligations that cannot be realized. The reactor was 40% completed by the German division of Siemens, and we received the contract on the condition that we finish all construction by the end of 2001. According to associates of Atomstroyeksport, the authors of the contract were aware that the deadline was unrealistic. Specialists are also certain that the deadline that has now been announced, the end of 2002 is also unrealistic six years are needed." Slivyak also says Russia typically finances construction of nuclear power plants abroad, and that Iran is the exception. "We do not extend credit to it, but there is concealed financingâwe spend our own money to produce the equipment, ship it there, and then are supposed to receive reimbursement." [Note: On 7 January 1995, an Iranian official said the first unit was 90%. In August 1995, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov said the first unit was 70% compete.]
In an Iranian television broadcast, Iranian President Rafsanjani says Iran is not seeking nuclear weapons "at all." He describes the program as "for the peaceful development of the country and humanitarian and health fields under full supervision of the IAEA." However, the IAEA has a limited safeguards agreement with Iran, and supervises very few of Iran's nuclear activities. An IAEA source says the agency "will not get involved" in completing Bushehr, saying "statements by Iran that Busheir [Bushehr] is being finished under IAEA auspices simply ar en't true."
In an Iranian television interview, Hassan Rowhani, secretary-general of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, declares that Iran will decide by mid-March whether to continue negotiations with the European Union. He says Iran has repeatedly told Europe it would be willing to hold nuclear talks for months, not years, as long as they are fruitful. The secretary asserts Iran will be able to produce yellow cake within the next few months, and referred specifically to activities at the Isfahan UCF and Arak Heavy Water plants. He stresses the importance of Iranian solidarity in the face of U.S. threats, reiterating that the IAEA has repeatedly declared there is no proof of Iran pursuing a nuclear weapons production program and declaring there is "no place for nuclear weapons" in Iran's defense doctrine. Rowhani dismisses the possibility of a U.S. military attack given Iran's cooperation with the IAEA and European Union, suggesting that anyway, Iran's nuclear capability is impervious to bombs and missiles.
A senior Bush administration official says that Russian companies continue to provide Iran with weapons of mass destruction technology. The official claims that this technology could assist Iran in developing chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. Although Russia officially agrees with the United States that there should be limits on providing technology to Iran, Russian authorities do not appear to have "clamped down" on this.
In an NBC news interview, President Bush states that military action against Iran remains an option "if it continues to stonewall the international community about the existence of its nuclear weapons program."
In contrast to previous reports, Iran announces that the Bushehr nuclear power plant will not be completed as scheduled due to technical problems. According to the head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, the plant will be completed in 52 months. The completion of the first phase of the construction was originally planned for 1999. [Note: Reports differ on the dates originally anticipated for the completion of the Bushehr reactor.]
In discussions with the President of Iran, German Economic Minister Juergen Moellemann reiterates that his country will not approve delivery of parts for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Several German firms that formerly dealt with Iraq and aided its nuclear program are now in contact with Iran.
In efforts to protect themselves against a potential attack from Iran, the US government considers stationing defensive missiles in European countries.
In Moscow, Iran nuclear affairs chief Hassan Rohani declares Iran's intention to "eliminate all concerns and fears" in the international community with the immediate temporary cessation of uranium enrichment activities. Later that day, permanent envoy to the IAEA Ali Akbar Salehi submits an official letter to IAEA chief ElBaradei, confirming Iran's readiness to sign the NPT's additional protocol, thereby allowing international inspections of its nuclear facilities. Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the Iranian declarations, noting that Russia was willing to proceed with the delayed completion of the Bushehr reactor, which is expected to go online in Spring 2005. Rohani also mentions upcoming negotiations with Russia to discuss the building of a second nuclear reactor at Bushehr.
In New York for the Non-Proliferation Review and Extension Conference, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev says, "We are prepared to discuss the Iranian issue," referring to Russia's nuclear deal with Iran.
In protest of Iran's nuclear program, the US House of Representatives votes to cut funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency by the exact amount that the IAEA is assisting Iran with the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The United States believes that the Bushehr project could help Iran's nuclear weapons program. [Note: See 5 August 1998.]
In response to a report by The Times of London [See 15-16 August 1997], the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (IAEO) denies it made efforts to obtain material for nuclear weapons manufacturing from South Africa. The AEOI says such an action would contradict the policies it adheres to as a signatory of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and that any nuclear activities undertaken by Iran would be done for peaceful purposes to be policed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The AEOI further states that Reza Amrollahi, the organization's head, has never been to South Africa, let alone attempted to procure nuclear technologies.
In response to a report made by Bonyan that Russian specialists working on the Bushehr nuclear power plant would return to Russia, Hamid Reza Asefi, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Minister, says Iran-Russia cooperation in the field of nuclear technology will continue, stating it is "developing successfully and has good prospects, and a preliminary date has been set for launching of the first unit of the nuclear power plant December 2003."
In response to accusations by the Mossad, Israel's secret intelligence agency, that Iran will be capable of producing an atom bomb by 2005, Binyamin Ben Eliezer, Israel's defense minister, calls for a meeting between security and intelligence services to discern the validity of the Mossad allegation. According to Jane's Foreign Report, previous Mossad conclusions proved false, and Eliezer and the heads of the security services believe Iran is still far from producing a weapon. [Note: See 24 August and 2 September 2001.]
In response to accusations made by the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, Iran's First Vice President Hasan Habibi says Iran's nuclear program was exclusively for peaceful purposes. This is the policy of President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government. [Note: See 14 June 1991 entry for allegations by the Mojahedin.]
In response to accusations that Russia supplied Iran with nuclear weapons in the early 1990s, Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesperson Gennady Tarasov asserts, "Russia has stated on many occasions that it has never rendered Iran any assistance in creating weapons of mass destruction." He adds, "Russian-Iranian cooperation in the nuclear sphere is orientated at purely peaceful and civil goals." [Note: See 13 April 1998 for an additional Russian response.]
A senior Clinton administration official says that Iran's efforts to obtain nuclear technology and materials from the former Soviet Union have been unsuccessful.
In response to accusations that Washington has backed a military strike by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice insists the U.S. is committed to following a diplomatic course and "put forward...a strengthened diplomatic hand for the European three to play."
In response to allegations made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, Ji Pei Ding, China's assistant foreign minister, reaffirms its stance that it will not sell nuclear technology to Iran.
In response to allegations made by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that Iran is working towards developing a nuclear weapon by the year 2000, Reza Amrollahi, head Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says, "Our nuclear program is peaceful...my country has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has expressed its willingness to honor it. Also, we are an active member of the International Atomic Energy Agency." Amrollahi asserts Iran seeks only to improve its ability to generate electricity for its populace and complete the work already started under the former Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, but he says Iran is involved with research to produce radioisotopes at a laboratory in Karaj. In response to claims by the CIA that it has halted sales of nuclear supplies to Iran by China and Argentina, Amrollahi says his organization is still purchasing low-grade uranium from Argentina and has signed a contract with China for the purchase of a nuclear reactor. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirms that a shipment of 20% enriched uranium from Argentina will arrive in Iran within the year.
In response to allegations that Iran has links to eight generators seized in Italy, Iran says it "has no direct links to these generators and by publicizing the issue, the West pursues other aims." The generators belong to the German company Siemens, which refuses to complete work on the Bushehr reactor in southern Iran despite pleas by the Iranian government to do so. [Note: See 11 and 13 November 1993.]
In response to Armitage's comments, Iranian government spokesman, Abdullah Ramezanzadeh says, "[The US] has leveled too many false accusations against us and they should stop that. They should also unfreeze our assets and lift the sanctions."
In response to complaints by Iranian officials that the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran is not progressing sufficiently, Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Nuclear Energy Minister, says by September there will be two shifts of Russians working in Bushehr, Iran. Adamov plans to oversee the construction personally, and make further attempts to increase the scope of the Iran-Russia nuclear technology relationship.
In response to Indian plans to sell Iran a nuclear research reactor, US Assistant Secretary of State Reginald Bartholomew goes to New Delhi to persuade India to cancel the sale.
In response to pressure from the United States against Czech sales of nuclear components to Iran, the Czech government states that it "has not decided, nor does it intend to decide in the foreseeable future, on any shipments of nuclear technology to Iran." Earlier in the month, the Czech minister of industry and trade had defended a possible deal between Skoda and Iran.
In response to repeated warnings for Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions or face UN sanctions, Hamid Reza Asefi asserts "we don't know with what language to tell the Europeans and Americans that Iran is not afraid of the UN Security Council. We have been subject to sanctions in the past. In the short term, it has put us under pressure. But in [the] long term, it has helped our economy to flourish."
In response to reports that Iran was negotiating to buy nuclear weapons technology from China, China says it does not "advocate, encourage, or practice nuclear proliferation, nor does it help other countries to develop nuclear weapons."
In response to speculations in the Western media that Israel is considering an attack on Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant, Iran warns Israel that such an attack would be a "blunder." According to the Iran News, Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nuri's responds to rumors of an Israeli strike by saying, "Should Israel commit such a blunder, we will teach her a lesson not to ever attempt another aggression against Iran." Iran cautions Israel for the second time not to attack the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
In response to the poor progress made on the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran, Yevgeniy Adamov, Russian minister of atomic energy, says Russia and Iran will explore methods to speed up construction of the nuclear power plant. Adamov reaffirms that "Iranian-Russian ties are profound and serious in all areas, including in the area of peaceful use of nuclear power." In response to US attempts to impede work between the two nations, Iran will cede most of the workload of the Bushehr plant construction over to Russia, an action that adds $50-100 million to the $800 million already agreed upon. [Note: See 13 May 1998.]
A senior defense source from Israel says Iran's attempts to present the Bushehr nuclear power plant as for civilian use only is "a type sophisticated fraud." The facility, according to the senior defense source is only "a part of the overall picture of Iran's ongoing effort to achieve nonconventional weapons atomic, biological, and chemicalâwhile also developing long-range missiles."
In response to the US announcement of its new nuclear weapons strategy targeting seven states, including Iran, and hinting about an end to the moratorium on nuclear testing, Iran writes a letter of protest to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi writes, "US threats are a flagrant violation of its commitments to the [Nuclear] Non-Proliferation Treaty and go against guarantees given by US officials."
In response to US concerns, Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian denies that Chinese nuclear and missile sales to Iran and Pakistan violate any international agreements.
In response to US objections to Russian nuclear assistance to Iran, Georgiy Kaurov, head of the information directorate of the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy, says that the nuclear cooperation between the Iran and Russia is in line with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and that Iran's nuclear facilities has been inspected by the IAEA without any violations.
In response to US State Department spokesman Richard Baucher statement that Iran is allegedly using technologies provided by Russia to obtain nuclear weapons, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev says that Russia does not violate international obligations and that "all of Iran's activities are under IAEA control."
In spite of reports that the United States has promised Russia $10 billion if it ceases its nuclear cooperation with Iran, Nikolai Shingaryov, an official at the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry, tells Interfax that the ministry has yet to receive an official US proposal of economic incentive in exchange for terminating its atomic cooperation with Iran. He states, "America did not make an official proposal to the effect at a Moscow meeting between Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev and US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security John Bolton last week... the Atomic Energy Ministry is ready to discuss American proposals if they are officially made to Moscow."
In spite of US accusations, Iran states that it is expecting to receive a clean bill of health from the IAEA 16 June board meeting.
In talks at the nuclear technology conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Reza Amrollahi, Iran's representative to the conference, states "Iran's Atomic Energy Organization pursues utilization of nuclear technology for development of the country." Amrollahi enumerates his countries activities as solely for peaceful purposes that include construction of the Bushehr power plant, mining of uranium, manufacture of radioactive isotopes and research in the country's various reactors.
In talks with President Bush, the IAEA's ElBaradei asserts that Iran is now cooperating fully and that its nuclear weapons-building intentions are still uncertain.
In Tehran, fears of possible attack of Israel to the Bushehr nuclear reactor are very much alive. Iran's Foreign Minister Kamel Kharrazi tells the Independent, "everyone in Iran is concerned about the Israeli threat... they have missiles; they have everything. That is why we have been trying to develop our missile technology to defend ourselves." Mr. Kharrazi asserts that the Bushehr plant was being built for the production of electricity, he adds, "we are negotiating with the Russians to provide fuel for the power plant to be returned afterwards."
In the final report of the Denver "G-7 plus one" summit, leaders of the world's leading industrial countries called on all states to curtail supplies of dual-use technology to Iran's strategic weapons program. The report was signed by Russia, which along with China is Iran's largest supplier of advanced conventional weapons, as well as a supplier of dual-use technology. The report says, "We call on all states to avoid cooperation with Iran that might contribute to efforts to acquire nuclear weapons capabilities, or to enhance chemical, biological, or missile capabilities in violation of international conventions of arrangements."
A senior Iranian negotiator says the United States should offer further incentives and "unblock frozen Iranian assets, lift sanctions and stop 'hostile measures'." On Friday, U.S. President George Bush offered to lift the block on Iran's membership to the World Trade Organization and allow Tehran to obtain parts for commercial planes, but Tehran rejected the American offer as 'insignificant'.
A US House of Representatives subcommittee investigation documents that over 230 companies form the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, including over 50 US businesses, have sold materials and equipment to Iran useful in the production of weapons of mass destruction. These transactions were made with the approval of their government export-control officials, according to Kenneth R. Timmerman. Timmerman claims that since the US Congress passed additional restrictions on sensitive technology sales to Iran in October 1992, US companies have been permitted by the US Commerce Department to export centrifuges, gas separation devices, gas chromatographs, machine tools, mass spectrometers, and million-dollar supercomputers to Iran that can assist Iran in developing nuclear weapons. Between January 1993 and June 1993, one of these sensitive US high-technology exports was shipped straight to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Acting Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Administration of the Department of Commerce Iain Baird calls Timmerman's claims misleading, citing the Commerce Department's full compliance with the 1992 National Defense Authorization Act. Baird adds that a $1 million computer exported to Iran was actually an outdated computer "attached to a well-logging system used in the oil and gas industry" which was not considered a national security concern.
In the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) press conference in Malaysia, Khattami states that Iran will not end its nuclear program. Khattami also reminds that Iran was one of the first nations to support a WMD-free zone in the Middle East.
India and Iran exchange nuclear scientists. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran negotiates to purchase nuclear technology or expertise from India following a 1 February 1991 announcement by the Indian Atomic Energy Commission that India will seek to export its nuclear technology.
India offers to sell a 10MW research reactor to Iran. The two countries also discuss a nuclear cooperation agreement, and Iran has requested India's helping building a pressurized heavy water reactor. Iran is reportedly interested in a 30MW reactor.
India says it will sell a nuclear reactor to Iran, and says it has not been pressured by the United States or any other body to stop the deal.
India signs an agreement to supply Iran with a 10MW research reactor, as part of a memorandum of understanding on scientific and technical cooperation. The reactor is to be located at Moallem Kalayeh, a secret uranium enrichment complex near Qazvin. Under pressure from the United States and other countries, India cancels its agreement.
A senior Iranian official reveals that Iran is seeking to establish its own fuel cycle out of concern that US pressure may work on foreign suppliers. Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Javad Zarif says in an interview at the UN, "You don't expect Iran to sit still....We don't have any confidence that two years down the road, three years down the road, the pressure by the United States may or may not work on our suppliers. We have to create source of self-sufficiency, which will include a fuel cycle program."
Indian Foreign Minister Sing Solanki signs a technical cooperation deal with Iran ensuring the delivery of 10MW reactor to Iran.
Indonesian Vice President Sudharmono and Reza Amrollahi, president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, discuss bilateral cooperation for peaceful nuclear energy development between Iran and Indonesia.
A senior Iranian official states that Iran is considering withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) because Western nations continue to deny it nuclear technology, even though it has complied with the NPT's requirements. The official statement confirms "rumors" circulating in the Western intelligence community that Iran might decide to leave the NPT. At the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 1995 NPTReview and Extension Conference in Geneva, the Iraniandelegation claims that Iran is not being granted access to technology designed for peaceful use of nuclear energy as stipulated by Article IV of the NPT. Iranian delegates to the International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference in Vienna say that Iran would postpone its decision on withdrawal from the NPT until closure of the final Preparatory Committeemeeting for the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. A USofficial notes that Iran had nothing to gain from leaving theNPT and would be "better off" gauging the extent of Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) support at the January 1995 PrepCommeeting. A Japanese official remarks that North Korea had succeeded in withdrawing from the NPT and was "rewarded with power reactors." The Japanese official says Iran might attempt a similar maneuver. Officials observe that although the Iranian delegation to the General Conference seemed sympathetic to the NPT and uneasy with the hardline stance ordered by Tehran, "quitting the NPT is a card" Iran could play at any time. Pakistani sources confirm Iranian claims that the United States pressured Pakistan into denying Iraniannuclear specialists access to a Chinese-supplied pressurized water reactor (PWR) at Chashma, northeast of the Pakistanitown, Faisalabad.
Inferences made by President Clinton that Iran may misuse the nuclear technology it is given by Russia to produce nuclear weapons rather than to generate electricity provokes a response by Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister. Kozyrev says, "Iran clearly stated it is prepared to open its nuclear facilities for inspection."
Informatsionnoye Agentstvo Ekho Moskvy (Moscow) reports that a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said the Russian government would have prevented the transfer to centrifuges if the United States had not done so.
Info-Tass reports that the Asian Foundation for Thermonuclear Studies, formed as a result of a meeting between representatives of Russia's scientific circles and officials from nuclear ministries and corporations of China, India, and Iran, plans to design the world's first international experimental thermonuclear reactor. Scientists have proposed a design deadline for the reactor for July 1998. Russia's contribution will most likely be in the form of scientific and technical expertise and innovative thinking. [Note: The foundation is also called the Asian Fusion Research Foundation. See 4 and 29 March 1996.]
Intel and Sun Microsystems say they have no current business with three Russian institutes against whom the United States recently applied sanctions for allegedly aiding Iran's missile and nuclear weapons programs. But the US companies say the Russian institutes may have already acquired their technology.
Intelligence Newsletter reports that there are three military nuclear facilities in Iran: the Amriabad laboratory, built in 1967 and upgraded by the United States in 1970 and 1974; in Karaj, 45k m west of Tehran; and in Moallem Kalayeh, which reportedly has a 40MW reactor. The report also says that 300 Iranian nuclear experts are being trained around the world, mostly in Russia.
Intelnews of Kiev reports that Turboatom plant in Kharkov is to sign a production contract with ZagranAtomEnergoStroy in Moscow for the production of two turbines for the Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Interfax reports Russia has sent to Iran a VVER-1000 [1000MW light water] nuclear reactor. The unit will be installed in the Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran. Bulat Nigmatulin, Russia's Deputy Atomic Energy Minister, says the plant should be "launched" by September 2003. The Atomic Energy Ministry does not exclude the possibility that more nuclear power plants will be constructed, which may or may not be in Bushehr. The Russian Atomic Energy Ministry and its Iranian counterpart have scheduled fueling of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, and will provide training for Iranian scientists at the Novovoronezhskaya nuclear power plant in Russia.
Interfax reports that a high-ranking Russian diplomat denied rumors that Kazakhstan would have sold 600k g of uranium to Iran had the United States not purchased it first. According to the official, the Kazakhstani fuel is incompatible with Iran's nuclear research reactor, and Iran has no other operational nuclear power stations. Also, the official said, "Over the recent years, Iran has not shown any nuclear ambitions." The official contends that the motive behind such rumors is to give momentum to a plan to place Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and in particular Russian, nuclear programs under either US or international control. The official suggested that these rumors are linked to recent reports about Russian and CIS nuclear materials smuggling.
Interfax reports that according to anonymous sources the company Atomenergoproyekt is working on a feasibility study for an additional two reactors at Bushehr, a study which should be finished by the end of the year. A source at the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry says additional reactors after the first unit are "not ruled out," but would not necessarily be built at Bushehr. [Note: See 16 January 2001.]
Interfax reports that Iran and Russia are holding talks on training over 700 Iranian nuclear experts for work in the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The talks are between the Iranians and Russia's Zarubezhatomenergostroy (company for nuclear power engineering abroad), which is engaged in the construction of Bushehr. Other Russian scientific institutions, however, are also considering training Iranian experts.
Interfax reports that Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg will ship equipment to the Bushehr nuclear power plant on 16 November, according to a source in the company. The company has built the "casing and upper unit of the reactor's water unit, a compensator, all of the units within the casing, a steam generator, and other equipment," according to the source.
Interfax reports that Kamal Kharazi, the Iranian foreign minister, will visit Moscow for a two-day visit starting 18 February 2002. The negotiations with Russian officials will focus on weapons of mass destruction, among other issues.
A senior Israeli defense source says, "We cannot live with nuclear weapons in Iran....We prevented the Iraqis in the past and we can also prevent them."
Interfax reports that Russian experts have begun to examine the condition of the Bushehr nuclear power station. A spokesman for the Russian company that builds nuclear facilities abroad, Zarubezhatomenergostroy, says that some of the equipment that had been specially stored shows "almost no signs of corrosion" and adds that the "devices kept in zinc containers filled with nitrogen are in an ideal state and can be used at any moment." The Russian experts however say that the plant's "electrical equipment requires complete replacement 'because it does n't function or meet the requirements of designers'." A complete report will be submitted to Iran in September.
Interfax reports that the Leningradsky Metallichesky Zavod [Leningrad Metal Factory] has manufactured basic parts of the 1,000MW turbine to be installed in Bushehr.
Interfax reports that the nuclear power plant that Russia is building in the Bushehr province of Iran will cost Russia $60 million. It is estimated that about 200 Russian nuclear scientists are presently working in Iran. Iranian personnel for the power plant will be trained at the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant's training center.
Interfax reports that Turboatom, the Ukrainian plant contracted to supply Iran with turbines for its planned Bushehr nuclear power station, wants compensation for the loss it has suffered due to Ukraine's withdrawal from the agreement to supply the turbines, said Turboatom's General Director Anatoliy Bugayets. The plant's overall losses total about $130 million and its direct losses (the amount spent on the development of the turbine) total $5.1 million. A total of 5,000-7,000 jobs may also be lost.
International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Hans Blix meets with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Moscow. Kozyrev states that Russia welcomes IAEA supervision of Russian programs to construct nuclear reactors in Iran, India, and elsewhere. Blix says that the IAEA is ready to oversee implementation of the Russian-Iran agreement on the completion of the nuclear power station in Bushehr. According to Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov, Russian supervision of the construction of "two to four sets" at Bushehr may be increased.
International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Hans Blix visits Iran to discuss a nuclear-weapon free zone in the Middle East. Blix also discusses verification and safeguards arrangements in a nuclear-weapon free zone. Blix meets with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, Atomic Energy Organization Commission Chairman Reza Amrollahi, the first Deputy to the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hassan Habibi, and the Deputy to the Speaker of the Majlis, Hassan Ruhani, as well as various members of parliament. Additionally, Blix discusses the possibility of cooperation in technical matters, such as the use of radioisotopes to study rising water levels in the Caspian Sea. Amrollahi states that Blix has supported Iran's proposal to establish a nuclear-free Middle East, which would require that all countries in the region cooperate on the issue.
A senior Israeli military official says Iran will have nuclear capability within five years if the United States does not pressure Russia to stop providing military aid to Iran. Israeli intelligence has information that Iran plans to upgrade its Shehab-3 ballistic missile to make it capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and to extend its range to 1,300 miles. The Israeli official says that Iran is currently working on the Shehab-4 and Shehab-5. He says that because of this new intelligence, the United States and Israel are discussing ways to increase pressure on Russia to stop military assistance to Iran. He also states that Israel views the combination of surface-to-surface missiles and non-conventional weapons in Iran as "a threat to the world."
International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Hans Blix arrives in Iran ostensibly to "inspect" two nuclear research centers. An IAEA spokesman says Blix would visit the Bonab nuclear research center in West Azerbaijan province and the center in Mazandaran province. Neither site is subject to IAEA safeguards, and IAEA sources said the agency knows little about them.
International Atomic Energy Agency spokesman David Kyd announces that the "IAEA has not detected any suspicious nuclear activities being carried out" in Iran which violate the NPT or any other laws governing non-proliferation. The IAEA team inspected the research center at Isfahan and the experimental reactor at the University of Tehran four times in the last year. The two reactors under construction at Bushehr were not inspected because no form of nuclear fuel has been transferred there yet. Kyd also stresses that the "IAEA [has] never detected any sort of suspicious activity in Iran."
Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh suggests that U.S. commandos are in Iran selecting sites such as nuclear and missile installations for future air strikes; his intelligence sources point to Iran as the Bush administration's "next strategic target." The White House has countered that Hersh's article, published in the New Yorker magazine, is "riddled with inaccuracies." Pentagon spokesman Larry DiRita said of Hersh's article that his "sources feed him with rumor, innuendo, and assertions about meetings that never happened, programs that do not exist, and statements by officials that were never made." Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman has denied Hersh's allegation that U.S. Special Forces have been working with Pakistani scientists with Iranian contacts.
Iran accuses the United States of sabotaging its cooperation with the IAEA by constantly alleging that Iran is attempting to build nuclear weapons. Hamid Reza Asefi, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman, tells IRNA, "We believe that the US is sabotaging the close and constructive cooperation between Iran and the IAEA....The arrogant US officials are about to weaken the international organization by distorting facts."
A senior Israeli military official says that Iran tried to buy centrifuges, heavy water, and other parts needed to start a nuclear weapons program, from Argentina. A diplomat from the Argentine embassy in Tel Aviv confirms that Argentina was negotiating to sell such items, but agreement was never reached due to the "political situation." The Argentine diplomat would not confirm that Iran had an agreement to buy fuel rods and then negotiated for the heavy water. Iran also tried to obtain other components for uranium enrichment, including uranium hexafluoride; this pattern of acquisition and Iran's drive to self-sufficiency for nuclear production signals military intent, says the Israeli official. Iran has organized a network of front organizations throughout Europe to buy nuclear and missile technology. Purchases are often made in the name of Sharif and Amir Kabir universities. The Israeli official says, "We have to ask ourselves why Iran needs its own production of heavy water and an enrichment capability when it is provided by the supplier."
Iran acquires nuclear weapons "ready for immediate use" from CIS countries, according to the German weekly Focus. The weapons are reportedly "an atom bomb which can be dropped from an airplane and a launcher for missiles with nuclear warheads." [Note: This probably refers to reports that Iran bought nuclear warheads from Kazakhstan. See 1992 entry above.]
Iran agrees to buy turbines from a factory in St. Petersburg, Russia. The deal would add significantly to the $850 million contract for Russia to build the nuclear reactor at Bushehr.
Iran allocates $150 million for this year's work on building the Bushehr nuclear power plant, up from $100 million in 1998. [Note: See 11 October 1998 entry for a slightly different amount.]
Iran allocates $4.2 billion for its nuclear program for 1991 to 1994.
Iran and China announce a deal for a 300MW reactor near Tehran.
Iran and China sign a deal in Tehran to construct two 300MW nuclear power plants in Ahvaz, following an agreement signed in Tehran in February of 1992. [Note: See 22 November 1992 entry.]
Iran and France sign a $1 billion agreement settling a financial dispute over Iran's involvements in the Eurodif uranium enrichment plant. France will pay $1 billion to cover the balance of repayment plus interest, and Iran will retain a small share of the Eurodif consortium. This may cancel the possibility of reimbursement to French firms for claimed damages cause by Iran's cancellation of a nuclear plant contract.
Iran and Pakistan sign an agreement for joint development of nuclear weapons, according to Iran's Mojahedin-e Khalq opposition group. The group says Iran will provide $5 billion in funding; Pakistan will supply expertise in uranium enrichment and other areas. Pakistan denies the reports.
Iran and Russia conclude discussions regarding the proliferation, disarmament, and export of nuclear technologies. The two sides report that the conference is meant to strengthen the relationship between the two nations regarding nonproliferation issues, and that each nation believes an attack or threat of an attack on peaceful nuclear facilities will likely provoke a response as dictated in the United Nations Charter. A further statement on the agreement of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East is agreed upon by the two nations. Both Russia and Iran state that a nuclear-weapon-free zone will reduce the tension created by India's and Pakistan's nuclear tests. Though they express their resolute dedication to prohibitive measures against the spread of nuclear technology, they reaffirm the importance of maintaining the right of any nation wanting nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
Iran and Russia reject allegations that Russian nuclear scientists have withdrawn from the Bushehr nuclear plant.
Iran and Russia sign an intergovernmental agreement on the construction of a nuclear power plant in Iran on the border with Turkmenistan by the Caspian Sea. The United States and International Atomic Energy Agency protest the decision. According to the leading Russian newspapers, the main reason for US objections is that Western countries want to force Russia out of the nuclear market. However, the project is important for Russia because of its deteriorating economic situation and severe need for hard currency.
Iran and Russia sign two agreements,"On Building a Nuclear Plant" and "On Cooperation in the Area of Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy." The Iranians want the Russians to build a nuclear power plant in northern Iran, but the geological data show the area was susceptible to dangerously high seismic activity, and it is decided to continue the work started years previously at the Bushehr site.
Iran and Spain sign a protocol saying that Associated Enterprises of Spain will build the Bushehr reactors, with some assistance from Kraftwerk Union (KWU). German export law prohibits KWU from working directly on the project, but the companies hope to circumvent this by having Spain as the main contractor. Safeguards will apply.
Sources in the Ministry of Economic Development deny a report in the Washington Post that Russia has shipped to "Iran durable aluminum," which can be used in the creation of nuclear weapons. US officials have said the metal can be used to make rotor blades for uranium-enriching gas centrifuges. Russian experts from the Economic Development Ministry say that they have supplied neither aluminum, nor any of its products or its alloys. [Note: See 26 September 2001.]
Iran and the IAEA announce that Mohamed El Baradei will visit Iran on 9 July, for the second time this year. This planned visit came after the unfavorable IAEA report on Iran, after which Hassan Rowhani, the Iranian Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, invited Dr. El Baradei to visit Iran "to remove technical problems." An Iranian senior official says "I do think this means Iran is moving to sign the [additional] protocol. It is a confirmation that Iran wants to work with the agency."
Iran and the Soviet Union sign a nuclear cooperation agreement. [Note: See 7 February 1991.]
Iran announces that a delegation from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran will visit Russia and China to "discuss nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes." Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, AEOI head, will stay one week in Moscow to discuss nuclear cooperation between Tehran and Moscow, and the completion of the Bushehr power plant. The AEOI plans to make a similar visit to China within the year.
Iran announces the first phase of its $33 million electron accelerator is operating. The center is in Yazd. The accelerator is believed to be a 3 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator. Iran's state-run radio says that the accelerator would be used for various industrial purposes, and not as a tool to develop nuclear weapons as the United States has claimed. [Note: See 3 June 1997.]
A senior member of the Iranian negotiating team, Sirus Nasseri, says "any negotiations surrounding Iran's nuclear program will be based on the continuation of [uranium] enrichment." Nasseri indicates President Bush's comment that military action would not be the first option to address Iran's nuclear ambition, clearly demonstrates Washington is aware a military attack will have no impact.
Iran appoints a five-member team to determine Iran's stance toward the IAEA's deadline. The members are Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi; Minister of Information Ali Yunessi; Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani; Secretary of the High National Security Council Hassan Rowhani; and the supreme religious leader's adviser for international affairs, Ali Velayati.
Iran asked the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for help in operating a center for nuclear studies. Iran denies reports that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons rather it seeks help from western experts to ensure that existing nuclear projects are following the highest international safety standards. On 17 May, the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Agency, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, informed the director of the IAEA, Mohammed Al-Baradi that Iran wishes to obtain more of its support. Aqazadeh invited the IAEA to supervise a nuclear education center located west of Tehran. A prominent official in the Iranian Atomic Energy Agency stated recently that Iran's first energy producing nuclear reactor (with Russian support) located at the Gulf port of Bushehr does not have the highest quality of supervision due to the imposed western sanction on "dual- use" technology. Iran said that western sanctions hinder attempts to obtain 10% of the energy that Iran needs for the next two decades by using nuclear energy.
Iran asks Russia for heavy water reactors, and Russia refuses because of proliferation concerns.
Iran asks the French government to deliver enriched uranium as specified in a 1974 contract between the Shah and a French consortium to build a uranium enrichment plant. However, under heavy US pressure, France decides not to sell nuclear technology to Iran. [Note: See 1974 and 1979.]
Iran awards a subsidiary of the British firm MW Kellogg (a firm that also was involved in America's Manhattan project in the 1940s) a $400 million contract to build a civilian ammonia and urea plant for manufacturing fertilizer at Bojnurd in Khurasan province, near Turkmenistan. According to Natural Resource Defense Council in Washington, DC, industrial procedures in the production of synthetic ammonia can also be used to manufacture heavy water.
Iran begins negotiations to rebuild the Bushehr reactors with nuclear construction firms in Argentina, Brazil, France, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia.
A senior official from the South Korean government characterizes as "groundless" press reports in Japan and the United States that the United States was trying to include Russian participation in the North Korean project in an effort to persuade Russia to cancel its deal with Iran. The official says that the reports were meant to upset the system of cooperation that South Korea has with its allies on the nuclear reactor deal. Vyacheslav Sychev, an expert from the information department of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy says that "reports on Russia's possible participation in KEDO is a smokescreen for a large-scale operation to torpedo the Russo-Iranian contract on the delivery of Russian reactors to Tehran."
Iran begins negotiations with Mohamed ElBareidi over signing of NPT's additional protocol, which would allow inspectors open access to all Iran's suspected nuclear facilities. Iranian parliament's head of the National Security and Foreign Policy committee, Mohsen Mirdamadi says, "Iran's case should not go before the Security Council. If allowing inspections of military sites resolves this problem, then we should do it."
Iran Brief reports that a joint Chinese-Iranian team has been formed to look for uranium in Yazd and possibly Kerman. It also reports that China and Russia have imported chemicals into Iran, including anhydrous hydrogen fluroride, that can be used to make uranium hexafluoride. [Note: See 17 and 18 April 1996.]
Iran Brief reports that, according to Iranian journalist Fereydun Sahebjam, Iran has constructed several secret nuclear weapons facilities with North Korean assistance. The report says Iran has built two underground reactors and possibly an underground calutron uranium enrichment facility. The two underground reactors were built with the help of North Korean Air Force Commander General Cho Myong Rok. Iran built one of the reactors in the desert near Tabas in a nuclear complex constructed with Chinese and North Korean assistance. The report says that in February 1994, North Korea and Iran signed a nuclear cooperation agreement, according to South Korean and Arab media sources. Iran has also tested North Korean missiles in the region between Shahrud and Damghan, east of Tehran.
Iran brings a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against the German government for preventing Siemens from completing the two reactors at Bushehr.
Iran condemns the decision by the US House of Representatives to stop the payment of the US share to the budget of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Such action will prevent the IAEA from assisting Iran in the construction of its nuclear plants. The House of Representatives made the payment contingent on confirmation by the US Secretary of State that the funds will not go to assist Iran. [Note: See 20 July 1999.]
Iran confirms reports of inviting Britain, France, and Germany to visit Tehran for discussion on resolving nuclear issue.
Iran continues its uranium enrichment even though promises were made to halt it. Hamid Reza Asefi, Foreign Ministry spokesman, claims, "officials were still studying 'the modalities of a suspension'." The IAEA has said it will again review Iran's compliance on 20 November.
Iran criticizes the United States for carrying out sub-critical nuclear tests. "At a time when the United States finds fault with out supervised peaceful nuclear activities, it engages in destructive atomic tests," says Mahmud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry. "America's hostility against Iran has made it disregard the peaceful nature of our activities. This is a discriminatory attitude towards nuclear non-proliferation conventions."
Iran declares its intention to move forward with plans to construct a heavy water reactor to produce radioisotopes for medical research. Diplomats greet the announcement with concern however, as it is possible to reprocess the spent fuel rods to produce plutonium.
Iran declares its Isfahan site to the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time.
Iran denies any nuclear material has been moved from the Isfahan facility at the same time the IAEA is monitoring the site. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, says "Iran seeks nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. It would be meaningless for Iran to smuggle."
Iran denounces US propaganda of nuclear cooperation between Iran and China. Mr. Mohammadi, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, attributes this action to an US attempt to divert attention from what he believes is an increasing stockpile of nuclear weapons in Israel. Mohammadi further stresses that any collaboration concerning the exchange of nuclear information with other countries is explicitly done with peaceful objectives. Muhammad-Reza Ismailzadeh declares US attempts to damage the nuclear relationship between Iran and Russia is done so despite a declaration by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran's nuclear installations and reactors are for peaceful use only. Ismailzadeh warns that US endeavors in this area, such as its success in forcing China to end peaceful nuclear cooperation with Iran, will further US resolve in this arena.
A senior official of the Russian Foreign Ministry says Moscow will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons because that would endanger Russian national interests.
Iran dismisses reports of a fire at Isfahan Nuclear Center as propaganda spread by the United States and its allies. Iran also denies the existence of a nuclear power plant in Isfahan.
Iran drops demands to be allowed to continue some of its nuclear activities. An IAEA draft resolution for Iran to continue its suspension of nuclear-related activities was held up due to Iranian demands for some sensitive technology to be exempt from the deal.
Iran Expert reports that in light of Iran's recent refusal to ratify two new provisions of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United States and Israel have cast Iran as the most significant threat to peace in the Middle East. Iran believes itself justified not to ratify the provisions on the grounds that it has been denied nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, which is provided under Article IV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mohammad Khatami, Iran's president, continues to refute claims that Iran is seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction. Much of Western consternation comes in light of increasing evidence that Iran is using clandestine methods to acquire nuclear weapons. Jane's Defense Weekly reports Iran has attempted to acquire enriched uranium, fuel fabrication and processing capabilities, research reactors, gas centrifuge and enrichment technology, and uranium conversion and laser enrichment plants.
Iran expresses interest in India's new monazite-based fuel cycle technology for fast breeder reactors. The technology uses a blanket of thorium produced from the beach sands of Kerala, in southwest India.
Iran Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi claims, "I do not believe Iran will reach a dead end which could lead to sanctions." He further says Iran's nuclear activities were for peaceful ends and "totally transparent."
Iran freezes all sensitive nuclear work including uranium enrichment while France, Britain, and Germany circulate a draft resolution calling on the IAEA to notify member states if it finds Iran has resumed enrichment activity.
Iran hires a number of South African technicians whose jobs were eliminated following the demise of South Africa's nuclear weapons program. Iran has shown an interest in laser isotope separation, an area in which South Africa and Russia are known to have collaborated.
Iran is believed to be able to obtain nuclear equipment more effectively and at a cheaper cost than Iraq had been, and is feared to use it to increase instability in the region.
Iran is in the market for $50 million worth of turbines for the Bushehr power plant, according to Ukrainian officials.
Iran is ordered by an arbitration court in Switzerland to pay 4.06 billion francs to a French consortium of Framatome, Alcatel Alsthom, and Spie-Batignolles for canceling a contract to build a nuclear power plant in Darkhovin. [See the January, 28 February, 8 July, October 1991 entries for other developments in the loan dispute.]
A senior US State Department official suggests that there was evidence within the Bushehr contract that Russia intended to provide Iran with plutonium separation technology, but noted that Russia promised not to deliver such technology. [Note: This probably refers to the gas centrifuge in the secret additional protocol.]
Iran is prominently cited in an assessment of Middle East proliferation by IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei, who refers to the situation as "unsustainable" and suggests that "if we do nothing, catastrophe is only a matter of time." He supports the idea of a Middle East WMD-free zone, saying that "any enduring peace in the Middle East will only be achieved through an inclusive and comprehensive approach to security, which should include a ban on WMD, limitations on conventional armaments and appropriate security and confidence building measures." He adds: "Any attempt to achieve security for one country at the expense of insecurity for others will ultimately fail."
Iran lambastes Ukraine for its decision to back out of a deal with Iran to provide it with turbines for its nuclear power plant at Bushehr. Iran state radio calls the move unwise, stating, "Ukraine is only losing its political and commercial credibility. It lacks the qualifications to boost relations with Iran." Mahmud Mohammadi, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, condemns Ukraine's inference that it has an agreement with Iran on the construction of a nuclear plant in Bushehr, Iran. Mohammadi further states that its interest in nuclear technology is for peaceful purposes that are within the right of any sovereign state wishing to further its national development. Ukraine's decision comes after it reached an agreement with the United States on a new 30-year nuclear cooperation accord that will provide Ukraine will considerable funding. This accord confirms the two states' commitment to controlling the export of nuclear technology to states that do not possess nuclear weapons and allows Kiev to purchase American fuel for its reactors. [Note: See 6 March 1998.]
Iran negotiates the purchase of a 10MW nuclear research reactor subsequently installed at the Moallem Kalayeh site. [Note: Construction began on the Moallem Kalayah site in 1987, and a 10MW Indian reactor was planned for the site. See 1987 entry.].
Iran News denounces 'Zionist' attempts to lobby the US Congress to impose sanctions on Russia for providing Iran with nuclear technology. The daily asserts that both Russia and Iran have allowed inspections of the plant to take place, and that inspectors from international organizations have confirmed the plant is designed for peaceful applications. Mahmud Mohammadi, spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, affirms this conclusion, stating the plant complies with the tenets of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Iran offers $3.5 billion to Pakistan to share its nuclear technology. [Note: See 19 December 1995.]
Iran possibly opens a uranium ore processing plant near the Saghand uranium mine in Yazd province.
Iran prepays a Russian company, Kolomensky Zavod, $2 million for five emergency diesel generator plants, at least some of which are for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. [Note: See 11 February 2002.]
Iran provides a $3 million loan to save the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy from a financial crisis. Iran sends 77 nuclear and other scientists to study at the center. The center has a "policy of ignoring" whether visiting nuclear scientists are working in civilian or military projects. The center has access to a US-made supercomputer, lasers, and advanced microprocessors.
Iran purchases a cyclotron accelerator from the Belgian company Ion Beam Applications. The cyclotron is reportedly for its Nuclear Medical Research Center in Karaj. The center is said to be civilian, but Chinese and Russian technicians have been seen at the site. [Note: See 11 May 1991 and February 1992 entries.]
Iran receives world support on its decision to sign protocol to NPT. Iranian representative to the IAEA says Iran is also ready to sign a protocol to a previous agreement with Russia over the return of spent fuel from Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Iran refutes new allegations by the United States that it is seeking nuclear weapons, calling the accusations "absurd." A senior Iranian official reiterates Iran's "inalienable right to use nuclear technology."
Iran reiterates its unilateral commitment to the EU to stop uranium enrichment was only temporary and voluntary. "In the talks with Europe, we are conquering position after position. The ultimate goal is to preserve [our nuclear] fuel cycle, and we have a long way to go until we achieve it," said Supreme National Security Council Information Committee Director Ali Agha-Mohammadi. Sirus Nasseri, head of the technical and nuclear committee of Iran's team of negotiators said: "A final agreement in the new round of talks will be based on continuation of [uranium] enrichment by Iran."
Iran rejects accusations made by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that it is building and attempting to procure nuclear arms. The rebuttal comes in response to accusations made by the CIA in the New York Times that Iran is seeking to obtain nuclear arms. A source from the Iranian Defense Ministry says "The Islamic Republic of Iran which made the initiative to establish a dialogue of civilizations has no need of nuclear weapons and declares against violence."
Iran rejects Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent allegations over nuclear weapons. [Note: See 10 July 1996.] Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister responds, "Iran's doors are always open to international inspectors," and that they already had "visited Iran several times and confirmed that Iran plans to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes only."
Iran rejects the idea of the United States jointly monitoring the Bushehr nuclear power plant. "The only authorized body to supervise Iran's nuclear power plant in Bushehr is the International Atomic Energy Agency," says Mahmud Mohammadi, spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry. The Iranian news agency IRNA reports that Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov told Iran's ambassador in Moscow that Russia had not offered a joint monitoring agreement to the United States. [Note: See 21 September 1997 for a report of a Russia proposal for joint US-Russian monitoring.]
Iran Report reports that Anatoly Buhayets, director of Turboatom, the Ukrainian company originally contracted to supply turbines for the Bushehr plant, met with William Taylor, the US coordinator of assistance to the newly independent states, to find alternative means of compensation for cancellation of it deal for Bushehr. Buhayets finds the results of the meeting less than satisfactory, stating the United States failed to provide sufficient guarantees of compensation.
Iran Report reports that several Russian companies are involved with the Bushehr nuclear power station in Iran: Electrosila signed an $18 million contract to supply power generators; Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg signed a $44 million agreement to supply a reactor; and the Leningrad Metal Factory is expected to sign a contract to provide turbines. In addition, the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry is training 38 Iranian nuclear specialists at the Atomtekhenergo facility. The Iranians will have the opportunity to make international connections because the facility already trains Bulgarian specialists, and will soon train Indian and Chinese nuclear scientists.
Iran Report reports that the US Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) "Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Advanced Conventional Munitions (ACM)" says Iran "remains one of the most active countries" in the pursuit of WMD and ACM. Much of the effort Iran exerts for this purpose, according to the report, is directed at Russia, China, North Korea, and Western Europe, from which Iran has sought to acquire nuclear weapons and technology.
Iran reportedly signs a secret deal with Kazakhstan to buy four nuclear warheads, but the CIA stops the deal. In an unsuccessful attempt, the Iranians approach the Ulba Metallurgical Plant within the Ust-Kamenogorsk production complex in Kazakhstan in order to purchase beryllium and enriched uranium. The plant makes reactor fuel and metal components for the defense industry and has 600k g of surplus highly enriched uranium. There are conflicting reports as to why the Iranians wanted to purchase the uranium. Reports indicate that the Iranians sought to use the uranium as reactor fuel or for weapons. According to Ergali Bayadilov, Director General of the Kazak Atomic Energy Agency, Iran wanted to purchase safeguarded low-enriched uranium (LEU) to fuel the soon-to-be supplied Russian VVER-1000 [1000MW light-water] reactor. [Note: See 9 July 1995.]
A source at the uncompleted Iranian Bushehr nuclear power plant reports that 30,000 tons of the plant's main parts are being stored in Iran after export from Germany, although another 7,000 tons that were reportedly paid for by Iran are being held up because Germany has not issued an export permit.
Iran requests that EU nations allow it to continue to conduct "research and development" with centrifuges during the freeze period. Western diplomats say the European Union has rejected their request.
Iran requests the United States provide definitive proof of Iranian attempts to obtain nuclear weapons. Hasan Qashqavi, Iran's Ambassador to Almaty, states "Iran invites the United States to submit the documentary proof to the world forum to prove of its uninterrupted allegations." Iran reasserts its interest in nuclear technology is for peaceful purposes only, "Iran's objective behind setting up the Bushehr nuclear power plant is to gain access to a cheap source of energy through the development of a nuclear station with the cooperation of Russia."
Iran says China will continue its assistance to Iran despite reports by the United States that China has halted all nuclear technology trade with Iran. Mahumd Mohammadi, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, claims "Iran's nuclear program and cooperation with other countries is entirely peaceful, in accordance with international regulations and under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." US lawmakers were reportedly told in closed briefings that China will most likely continue to provide Iran with nuclear assistance, which runs contrary to a previous agreement reached between the United States and China. [Note: See also 13 and 14 March 1998.]
Iran says it will provide a detailed list of imported parts for its uranium enrichment program and show UN inspectors the location where they are stored. "These are items which were not bought officially, they were bought through intermediaries and it is not possible to trace intermediaries," says Iran's Ali Akbar Salehi.
Iran says no link exists between it and Switzerland for the trade of nuclear materials. Mohammad Reza Alborzi, Iran's ambassador to Switzerland, denies any link, stating, "Such accusations are baseless and are aimed at discouraging Switzerland from doing business with Iran." At the same time the Swiss assure its export procedures fully comply with the rules of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). [Note: See 25, 28, 30 June 1993.]
Iran says Russia agrees to finish the first reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant for $800 million. Reuters reports that Russian experts have already started work on the project. An official of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, identified as Mehralizadeh, says work at the plant has continued with a $850 million. [Note: The contract for the plant is signed on 8 January 1995.]
Iran says that despite the United States' best efforts, China has rejected demands for China's stop of nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Iran says that it is ready to sign an agreement renouncing nuclear weapons development.
Iran says will hand over full details on its nuclear enrichment program to the IAEA to allay concerns.
Iran signs the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty despite reservations. In an interview shortly after the signing of the treaty, Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister and head of the delegation, says that this is "a practical and clear sign of the truth" of Iran's steadfastness in their support of total disarmament of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, he says that his signature was accompanied with a letter that outlines Iran's reservations, which are that the treaty "fails to be within a framework of comprehensive nuclear disarmament treaty, [...] that in the field of control and supervision, national technical equipment only plays a complementary and temporary role," [...] and "that we oppose Israel to be placed in the Middle East and eastern Asia group."
Iran states it will postpone the building of three nuclear power stations. An unidentified source says the decision is due to budget constraints that Iran hopes to be rectified soon to ensure the Bushehr nuclear power plant will be completed by the end of 2000.
Iran states that 12 years ago it received 1.8 tons of uranium from China. The head of the Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirms that the 1991 shipment included 1 ton of hexafluoride and 800 kilos of UF4 uranium. He adds that at the time, Iran and China did not see any legal necessity to inform the IAEA about the Uranium shipment.
Iran steps up efforts to buy nuclear technology abroad at the start of the U.N. offensive against Iraq. According to a US State Department official, Iran is researching uranium enrichment methods and probably has "agents in Europe are scouring the market" for enrichment technology. The United States is concerned that Iran may acquire or already has acquired an un safeguarded enrichment facility for which it might get parts from Eastern Europe.
Iran successfully recruits 14 Russian nuclear scientists to work in Iran. Iran attempts to recruit Vladmir Kubov and Philip Gurkhanian from the Kurchatov Institute, Arsen Hamidiadeh from Kazakhstan, and Aleksandr Ahmediadeh from Turkmenistan. Six experts and scientists from the former Soviet Union are working at the Karaj nuclear site. Others are working at the Gorgan site, including Drs. Larichenkov and Ayshrov, both ethnic Russians. One of the 14 scientists has been identified as Khaled Nickov
Iran threatens to block the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) if its demands to change to the draft text are not met. Iran's delegate to the International Conference on Disarmament says Tehran has three concerns: The treaty does not call for a wider commitment to disarmament; the "national technical means" clause for monitoring could be used as a cover for spying; and Israel's membership in the executive council should not be part of Middle East group but as a Western nation. [Note: Iran announces on 11 September 1996 that it will sign the treaty.]
Iran will not be able to make a nuclear bomb until "the middle of the next decade," says a senior Israeli intelligence official. According to Israeli and other sources, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been delayed by US pressure on Iran's nuclear suppliers.
Iranian Ambassador to China Husayn Mir-Fakhr says China's sale of two nuclear reactors to Iran has not been terminated.
A source in the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy says the major equipment for the first reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant will be there early in 2002. The first unit is 80% complete, according to the source, and more than 1,000 Russians are working at the site. After the reactor is finished projected for 2003âit will take 18 months to load the fuel and test it, the source says.
Iranian ambassador to Russia Mehdi Safar says construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is nearly 40% finished. Safari says Iran and Russia are discussing the construction of four total units at Bushehr, a deal which would be worth $3.5 billion total. [Note: A previous report said Iran had agreed to construction of an additional three reactors, one at Bushehr and the other two at a location not yet specified. See 4 April 2000.]
Iranian Ambassador to Russia Mehdi Safari declares to Russian journalists that Iran does not intend to build nuclear weapons, and added that the Bushehr nuclear power station will be Iran's "first and last." [Note: See 10 September 1995 entry for a similar statement by Safari.]
Iranian Ambassador to Russia, Mehdi Safari, says that Iran and Russia should "develop cooperation in all spheres, including military-technical ties, the exchange of technologies, etc." Safari says that Iran was not a threat to the United States. In fact, Safari says Washington is manufacturing threats as a "pretext for the deployment of a limited national anti-missile defense system." Safari adds that, "Iran strictly abides by the principle of nonproliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction."
Iranian and Russian officials, including the Russian Atomic Energy Minister and the vice president of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, meet in Moscow to discuss the construction of the Bushehr nuclear plant. A representative of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry says that the participants at the meeting discussed "the issue of making an amendment to the Russian-Iranian agreement in the construction of a nuclear power plant in Bushehr, which is concerned with the return of spent nuclear fuel from Iran to Russia. Iran has re-confirmed its readiness to return spent nuclear fuel from Bushehr to Russia."
Iranian arms dealers Mehdi Kashani and Musa Khair Habibollahi purchase the small Hartenholm airport located north of Hamburg in Germany. The Iranians have reportedly been using the airport as a transit point for smuggling weapons-related materials and technology since sometime after 1985, and according to Western intelligence officials, continue to use the airport for smuggling nuclear weapons-related items and other goods under the new management of another Iranian, Nick Ahmed Semnar. [Note: See March 1995 entry.]
Iranian chief nuclear negotiator Hassan Rohani announces that his country will suspend all its voluntary confidence-building measures and return to making fuel if Iran is referred to the U.N. Security Council. Mr. Rohani indicates further repercussions could include pulling out of the NPT as some conservative parliamentarians have threatened.
Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani addresses the nuclear threat to Iran and its response. "We have neighbors who, due to international competition, have gained nuclear weapons," he says. "We do recognize that it is their right to have such capabilities, and they have apparently done so. We have no other alternatives but to defend ourselves in view of these developments. Although we are not trying to obtain non-conventional weapons, we must however, be able to protect ourselves against such threats."
Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani says that Iran is seeking to establish a non-aggression pact with neighboring countries.
Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani says that Iran's armed forces do not have any research program for developing nuclear energy for military purposes. Shamkhani points out that Iran adheres to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and that Iran's current programs are for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and conform to internationally agreed standards. He also notes that the policy of the Iranian government is to get rid of non-conventional weapons in the Middle East and Gulf region. Iran says that US-Israeli allegations regarding Iran's nuclear program are propaganda from "Zionist circles" aimed at preventing Iran from conducting peaceful nuclear projects.
Iranian Defense Minister Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani says if Israel attacks the Bushehr nuclear power plant, Israel "will receive a response, which no politician in Israel can even imagine." Asked if he means a nuclear response, Shamkhani says no, but says "actions will speak." He denies that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons or that Russia is supplying Iran with parts to enrich uranium.
Iranian Defense Minister Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani says it is not in Iran's interest to acquire nuclear weapons. "The presence of nuclear weapons with us," he says, "will turn us into a source of threat for others, which could be seriously exploited to harm our relations with the countries in the region."
Iranian Defense Minister Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani tells US reporters that Iran was not pursuing a nuclear arms program. He also says that US statistics regarding Iranian arms purchases were wrong. In light of the recent South Asia nuclear tests, Shamkhani says that Iran would continue to honor its commitments to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as well as the Comprehensive Tests Ban Treaty and would not conduct a nuclear test. He stresses that Iran would "never start a war against any other country."
A spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry says that Russian nuclear assistance to Iran is fully in line with all nonproliferation commitments.
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Larijani says that because Germany refused to finish construction of the Bushehr nuclear reactor, Iran has sought to build another nuclear reactor valued at $300 million. Larijani said that Iran has China's help on the construction of a nuclear reactor, and that Russia will finish the Bushehr reactor. Larijani says Iran has no reason to want nuclear weapons, since it has sufficient conventional capabilities to deter an attack.

"Nevertheless, the topic is sensitive, especially for the United States, and a decision has been made to give the issue more thorough consideration. This is being done by two commissions, Russian and American." The technology would have come from the Yefremov Scientific Research Institute in St. Petersburg, part of Minatom. The institute's director of microtechnology says the equipment, with an average capacity of 15 to 20W, could be used only for medical, industrial, or scientific uses. Sources say the deal may go through if the Russian and American commissions conclude the technology cannot be used for military uses.

Iran's Mojahedin-e Khalq opposition group reports that Iran requested nuclear warheads and uranium enrichment technology in a recent meeting with Chinese officials. [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
Iran's Mojahedin-e Khalq opposition organization claims that Iran country has allocated $200 million for nuclear weapons programs and is receiving help from Argentina, Pakistan, and China. A US administration official says Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons, and adds that the United States has tried to prevent the Argentina, Pakistan, and China from "selling equipment that would give Iran secrets to enable them to produce these types of weapons." [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
Iran's National Security Council head Rohani, speaking after meeting with IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei in Vienna, states that Tehran will be sending a letter to the IAEA next week. It will confirm Iran's intention to sign the NPT additional protocol, in addition to indicating precisely when Iran will begin implementing the agreement to cease its uranium enrichment program.
Iran's nuclear chief Gholam Reza Aghazadeh tells Le Monde that Iran is willing to sign the additional protocol of the NPT if Western countries drop their economic sanctions against Tehran. He says "We are waiting for the sanctions to be lifted before we sign."
Iran's nuclear chief reveals that he was assured by Russian officials that Moscow will not hold up the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant as a way to force Iran to accept the NPT's additional protocol inspections.
Iran's nuclear head Gholamreza Aghazadeh announces the inauguration of a uranium ore concentrate production plant near Bandar Abbas within a year, to be named the Bandar Abbas Yellowcake Production Plant.
Iran's nuclear program has an annual research budget of $800 million, and has major facilities at Tehran University, Moallem Kalayeh, and Isfahan. Iran's nuclear research program has received technical assistance from North Korea, India, and China. Two hundred technicians and more than 50 nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union have signed agreements with Iran.
Iran's permanent representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed Sadeq-Ayatollahi, says that Iran is willing to accept additional safeguards on two reactors to be supplied by Russia and would have "no objections" to returning spent fuel from the reactors to Russia. [Note: As of mid-October 1992, Russia had not agreed to a US request to accept the return of spent fuel from Iran.]
Iran's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Dr. Kamal Kharazi, says many countries in the Middle East are watching whether at a summit between the two leaders Russian President Boris Yeltsin "will succumb to US President Bill Clinton's demands or fulfill his country's commitment to Iran," referring to US pressure on Russia to cancel the deal for the nuclear energy plant at Bushehr. Kharrazi says he believes Russia will "honor" the deal. Kharrazi goes on to say that "Iran supports one of the groups which believes the NPT [Non-Proliferation Treaty] should be extended subject to the condition that there be a built-in mechanism which will ensure a review of the commitments made by the five major nuclear powers....This mechanism should be able to eradicate deadly weapons from the globe forever."
Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations, Hadi Najad-Hosseinian, writes a letter to the UN Secretary-General denying an Israeli statement that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons.
Iran's President Khatami claims, "We are ready to do everything that does not damage our national security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, even accepting the additional protocol."
Iran's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency affirms Iran's intention to return spent fuel to Russia. This prompts speculation that Iran is willing to compromise on some aspects of its nuclear deal with Russia in order to soften US resistance. US Secretary of State Warren Christopher welcomes the Iranian statement, which was made at the New York conference on the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Christopher adds, however, that the Russian-Iranian nuclear deal would be a major topic of discussion at the upcoming Clinton-Yeltsin summit meetings in Moscow, and that Clinton would share "very sensitive information concerning Iran's true intentions" with his counterpart in hopes of convincing Yeltsin to cancel the agreement. Evgenii Mikerin, head of the Fuel Cycle and Nuclear Weapons Production Facilities Directorate at Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, says that the plutonium from the Bushehr type of light water reactor does not readily lend itself to such applications. Although Iran has expressed an interest in acquiring centrifuge technology for uranium enrichment, Russia has never considered delivery of such technology, Mikerin says.
A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency visits Iran, but like the previous visit in February 1992, it is not a full or special inspection mission. The team visits three nuclear research centers, at Tehran, Isfahan, and Karaj, but is not given full access to all activities nor to soil and particle samples at the sites.
Iran's Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), Rowhani, makes statement against the United State's abuse of the IAEA and biased actions toward Iran. "This is the worst kind of interference in international law and order when a specialized United Nations agency and its legal authority are exploited for political objective of the United States," says Rowhani in an address to the 18th Conference of the Friday Prayers Leaders from across the country.
Iran's successful effort to enrich uranium using laser technology is referred to as a "troubling achievement in the annals of weapons proliferation." The IAEA report on Iranian nuclear activities acknowledges the recent opening of a pilot plant for laser-enrichment and concordant success in enriching tiny amounts of uranium -- grams not kilos. Some nonproliferation experts describe Iran's accomplishment as "startling."
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei denies that Iran seeks nuclear or chemical weapons. "Those claims have lost credibility in the eyes of the world's public," he says. "If such arms were source of real strength, the governments possessing those would have long succeeded in imposing their will over the world."
IRNA reports that Mohammed Javad Zarif, Iran's deputy foreign minister, regrets the failure of efforts made by the international community to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and offer guaranties to non-nuclear states for their security.

A three-day International Conference on Islamic Unity concluded in Tehran with a 14-article statement condemning any "conspiracy depriving Iran from nuclear energy."
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reports Iran has labeled accusations that it is working with Pakistan to develop nuclear weapons as "baseless." Mahmud Mohammadi, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, says though Iran views an arms race between India and Pakistan as destabilizing, and it sees Pakistan's successful exploding of a nuclear device as providing an "Islamic deterrent" to Israel. Mohammadi dismisses Israeli concern as an attempt to divert attention away from its own nuclear program. Iran claims stability in the region can only be attained through the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. He further states Iran's stance "has always stressed that the South Asian regions and the Middle East eventually be non-nuclear zones."
Israel Radio quotes Meir Degan, head of Mossad intelligence, as saying that Iran was close to "the point of no return" in it nuclear weapons program, and that this presents the greatest threat faced by Israel since its inception.
Israel threatens to impose sanctions on Russia if it does not halt plans to build a nuclear plant in Bushehr.

He further states correspondence between Israel and Russia is underway on what actions should be taken against Iran.
Israel Wire reports that Israeli intelligence and security officials have revised their estimate of how long it will take Iran to develop a nuclear weapon capability. The previous estimate of five to seven years has been changed to two to three years. Uzi Arad, special advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Minister of Industry and Trade, Natan Sharansky, met with US National Security Advisor Sandy Berger in mid-December 1998 to discuss the issue.
Israel Wire reports that Israeli security officials are concerned with the new Russian-Iranian cooperation agreement to expedite construction of Iran's nuclear power plant.

A Times report indicates Israel has drawn up and discussed secret plans with the United States to attack Iran if diplomatic effort fail to stop Iranian nuclear projects.
Israel Wire reports that Pakistan has assured Israel's ambassadors to the United States and the United Nations that Pakistan will not transfer nuclear technology or materials to Iran or to other Middle Eastern countries. Israeli officials had feared that Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi's visit to Pakistan shortly after its May 1998 nuclear weapons tests was a sign that Pakistan was preparing to sell nuclear technology to Iran.
Israeli Army intelligence head Uri Saguy says that within about eight years, Iran is likely to have developed a nuclear weapon. Saguy adds that Israel and other countries are undertaking measures to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Israeli Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Amnon Lipkin-Shahak says, "Iran is quite a few years away from having a [nuclear] bomb. The only way to stop it is by not allowing it to take shortcuts through persons or through technology that can be purchased in the free world."
Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer says Israel should not strike Iran's nuclear program, but should act through diplomatic channels and economic pressure to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, which he says could happen in 2005.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens calls for severing Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran. At the same time, Russia says that it will honor its agreements and will work to reach new agreements with Iran.
A top German official says Iranian nuclear power plants would not be a threat to peace. "Plants placed at the disposal of Iran are not capable of producing atomic weapons," says Rainer Funke, parliamentary secretary of the Ministry of Justice and member of the Bundestag.
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens says, "We know that [the Iranian nuclear program] is n't going smoothly. But with the help of foreigners, the Russians and others, I think in time they can achieve operational capacity."

Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai says Iran is trying to get unconventional weapons, and says, "Israel is using all means at its disposal in order to foil Iranian efforts to acquire nuclear and missile technology."
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai says, "Iran will never manage to produce nuclear weapons. We will make every effort to prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons, because whoever aims or threatens to produce nuclear weapons against Israel will never succeed."
Israeli defense officials describe Iran's attempts to gain nuclear and other unconventional weapons as "unprecedented." US intelligence sources indicate that Iran's unconventional weapons will become operational in 2002. Additionally, Israeli sources indicate that Iran and Syria have strengthened strategic ties, specifically with respect to unconventional weapons.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher states that Iran is undertaking a "crash effort to develop nuclear weapons." He expresses concern that other countries are assisting Iran in developing nuclear technology. According to a US official, Christopher's comments are targeted at Russia, which recently concluded a contract with Iran for the completion of two nuclear reactors. US diplomats indicate that it will be more difficult to secure Congressional approval for Russian aid if the contract is implemented. Sources say the United States is intensifying its efforts on several fronts to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons; including discouraging Russia and China from selling nuclear reactors to Iran.

Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak states that a regional peace including Iran would be required before Israel would discuss the future of its nuclear program.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres says Israel believes Iran is trying to obtain nuclear weapons as soon as possible by importing scientists and technology.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres says that a 14 December 2001 speech by former Iranian President Rafsanjani "leaves no room for any doubt as to Iran's hatred of Israel and its declared goal to destroy it." In a letter or United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, Peres says the speech "clearly contradicts the Iranian claim that its plans to acquire nuclear technologies are designed only for peaceful purposes."
A top official quotes Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as saying, "Israel has no intention of attacking Iran and continues to support the diplomatic efforts of the international community, in particular the United States, to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons."
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres says, "We know...[Iran] works very hard in various ways to attain a nuclear option. That not only means that it will attain a nuclear capability, but it says publicly that it plans or demands the destruction of another people."
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres writes letters to the foreign ministers of the countries on the United Nations Security Council protesting recent remarks by former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani that seemed to imply Iran would use nuclear weapons against Israel. Peres calls Rafsanjani's remarks "bone-chilling," and says they show Iran's nuclear program is not peaceful. [Note: See 14 December 2001 for Rafsanjani's remarks.]
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, referring to Israel's warning to Germany that smuggled Russian plutonium is being received by Iran, tells visiting German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel that "the time has come to settle accounts with Iran." Peres says that there is information indicating that Europeans have been selling "nuclear merchandise" to Iranians or Iranian groups. Peres wants Germany, which has hosted the head of the Iranian security services, to pursue a harder line against Iran in its foreign policy.
Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom claims Iran is "only six months away from having the knowledge to build a nuclear bomb."
Israeli intelligence reports indicate that although Iran has suspended uranium enrichment, Tehran continues to acquire elements for its nuclear capability. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon called on U.S. President George Bush "to step up the diplomatic efforts to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb." Israeli radio reported Sharon's aides as saying "Israel in not initiating or leading an offensive against Iran."
A top-secret report from the newly formed Russian intelligence service claims that Iran has obtained at least two nuclear warheads from a batch listed as missing from Kazakhstan. The nuclear weapons were reportedly smuggled across the border to Iran in 1991 and are under the control of Reza Amrollahi, who is head of the Iranian Organization for Atomic Energy and is also in charge of recruiting atomic scientists from the former Soviet Union. Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev is believed to have engineered the weapons deal with Iran, exchanging warheads for hard currency or gasoline. US officials have denied aid to Kazakhstan based on the belief that Kazakhstan has nuclear ambitions.
Israeli news outlet MIGnews reports that Israel and the United States paid Ukraine not to take part in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. According to MIGnews, Israel gave humanitarian aid to Ukraine, part of which was used to build a new wing at the Medical Academy of Kharkov. The United States paid Ukraine $250,000.
Israeli officials contend that, with Pakistan's help, Iran could produce a nuclear bomb by the end of the decade. US officials estimate 10 to15 years and say Iran is seeking a wide range of nuclear weapons technology.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says Iran is close to overcoming nuclear weapons "technical problems...[and] once they solve it, that will be the point of no return."
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stresses diplomatic pressure over a possible military strike to deter Iran from achieving nuclear weapon capability.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Russia's assistance to Iran in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant amounts to advancing Iran's capacity to build non-conventional warheads for the ballistic missiles he believes Iran is developing, "This is a step that runs counter to efforts at reaching peace and stability in the Middle East."
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns efforts by Iran to acquire nuclear technology "may be the most dangerous development in the 21st century." If its progress is allowed to go unabated, he states, it might some day have the technology to hit targets as far away as the United States. "Thus Russia should stop the delivery of modern weapons technology to Iran immediately and other countries should also try to induce Russia to take this step."
A top-secret report prepared by European intelligence services for leaders of the European Union and leaked to the Italian newspaper La Stampa, concludes that Iran will have nuclear weapons "in five, or at most seven years from now." The document also reports that Iran has requested Chinese assistance in its efforts to procure enriched uranium through the construction of plants designed to convert uranium from its mineral form.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warns the US Congress that nuclear weapons in the hands of Iran and Iraq would have dire consequences and calls for a strong international effort to isolate the two Middle East states.
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeniy Primakov agree to set up a joint committee to oversee the transfer of non-conventional weapons technology to Iran. Netanyahu says during the meeting with Primakov that Iran does not possess a missile that is able to reach Israel. Prime Minister Primakov refuses to answer questions as to whether Russia was granting Iran assistance in the nuclear field.
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu asks the US Congress to wait six months before applying sanctions against Russia or Russian entities for exporting dangerous items to Iran to see if Russia halts the exports on its own. The request is believed to be the result of a meeting the week prior between Netanyahu and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeniy Primakov. Netanyahu had previously asked the United States to impose sanctions against Russia for exporting items to Iran. One unnamed congressman replied that if the US does not apply sanctions, Iran will have nuclear weapons in six months.
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu presses US President Bill Clinton "to exert all his influence" to stop Russia from helping Iran obtain nuclear weapons. Netanyahu wrote Clinton "a secret letter" indicating that Clinton should persuade Russia to not sell nuclear reactors to Iran.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak expressed his concern to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin over continued Russian missile and nuclear technology leaks to Iran. Putin replies that his government was trying to stop the "leaks," but it was difficult due to private companies' involvement. Putin adds that Iran might be receiving technology from other sources. Putin also states that discussions over the technology leaks to Iran were ongoing with the United States. He reiterates Russia's proposition to hold similar talks with Israel by establishing a joint committee to exchange information on the transfer of technology to Iran, a proposal Israel has not favored in the past.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin asks Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec to prevent export from the Czech Republic to Iran of equipment that can be used in Iran's nuclear program, even for peaceful purposes, according to Israeli Ambassador to the Czech Republic Moshe Yegar. During his visit to Israel, Zieleniec claims that Czech exports could not be used by Iran for purposes that were not peaceful.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin says "hundreds of experts from Russia and China, who can smell hundreds of millions of dollars, will help Iran gain the technological know-how to convert its nuclear reactors for military use."
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin says China had assured him that its export of nuclear reactors to Iran "would not create any security risks to Israel."
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin says in an interview that Israel is asking the United States for help in stopping Iran and Iraq from developing long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. According to an Israeli intelligence official, China, North Korea, and some European countries are supplying manufacturing tools and components Iran is using in its nuclear weapons program. The official notes that Israel regularly provides the names of nuclear suppliers suspected of dealing with Iran to other countries' intelligence services, and adds that a first step in confronting Iran's nuclear weapons development should "focus on sanctions or a boycott."
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin states during a visit to Japan that he believes North Korea is exporting nuclear weapons technology to Iran. Rabin says he is concerned about nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and wants to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone, monitored by all Middle Eastern nations, as the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency have been "ineffective" in their attempts to monitor the region.
Israeli security sources say that Israel is examining a possible attack on the Iranian nuclear power plant in Bushehr, in the same way it bombed the Iraqi reactor in 1981.
Israeli sources say Iran tried to buy nuclear enrichment facilities from South Africa.

Italian customs authorities seize eight steam condensers for nuclear reactors, manufactured by the Italian firm Ansaldo, and prevent them from being exported to Iran. Italian authorities suspect that the condensers, valued at about $15 million, could be used for nuclear weapons production, and they are attempting to determine if the shipment of sensitive equipment was intended to be concealed by shipping it first to Germany. The order for the eight condensers was originally placed with Breda Termomeccanica (subsequently acquired by Ansaldo) by the German firm Kraftwerk Union for use in an Iranian nuclear power plant, but delivery was prevented by an embargo instituted during the Iran-Iraq War. Special authorization was needed to export the steam condensers, and would have been necessary even prior to the September 1993 Italian export law which requires special authorization from the Trade Ministry for all dual-use equipment exports. [Note: See 13 November 1993.]
A truck carrying equipment for a nuclear reactor is intercepted by the Kapitan Andreevo Border Checkpoint at the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Some documentation stated that the items were en route from Austria to Iran, while other documentation stated that the items were en route from France to Armenia. The Iranian Embassy in Baku denies the Iranian military or civilian involvement is trying to import the metal, although it did not rule out the use of this steel for civilian purposes by a private company. The Embassy calls a Russkiy Telegraf story reporting the matter "libelous" and states that it was an attempt by, "Zionist information circles" to cover up Israeli nuclear projects. [Note: See 17 April 1998 for what may be a related entry and 29 May and 27 December 2000 for other seizures/arrests at the Bulgarian border.]
Italian police seize "ultra-sonic equipment for the testing of nuclear reactors," which originated in Slovakia, passed through the port of Bari, and were destined for Iran via Greece. Iranian smuggling is also said to receive active support from Syria and Pakistan, who often transship items to Iran.
Italy seizes ultrasound equipment bound for Iran at the port of Bari. The equipment can be used for reactor testing.
ITAR-TASS news agency reports that Russian reactors used in the construction of nuclear power plants in Iran cannot be used for military purposes. An anonymous ministry specialist says that the reactors are incapable of producing the fissionable material needed to produce a weapon.
ITAR-TASS reports that Aleksandr Rumyantsev, the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, believes the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant may be delayed if the war in Afghanistan expands. Rumyantsev further states that up to 1,000 workers may have to be recalled if the war escalates, but if construction is unimpeded by the conflict the plant will be complete by 2003 plus an additional 18 months to load fuel and test the reactor.
ITAR-TASS reports that an estimated 30 Russian specialists are working at the Buhsher nuclear power plant. In addition to completing construction of the site, the specialists are also effecting repairs of "subsidiary objects."

ITAR-TASS reports that Iran made three attempts in 1997 to procure Russian nuclear components and technologies. According to the report, the Sanam, a state-run company in Iran, attempted to purchase dual-use technologies from the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute in Zhukovskiy and the Mytishchi machine-building plant in order to build its own missiles. Vladimir Orlov, the director of the Russian center for political studies, claims a 32-year-old Iranian citizen, Reza Teymiri, was arrested last November [1997]. Orlov asserts that such incidents highlight the importance of curtailing the problem before it becomes wider spread, asserting "This is not Russia's problem alone. Iranians are very active in the CIS. US companies also tried to pass on to Iran components of rocket technology."
ITAR-TASS reports that Iranian and Russian nuclear experts are scheduled to meet this week to discuss fuel options for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The experts will choose between two Russian nuclear fuel plants, one at Elektrostal and the other at Novosibirsk. The provision of fuel is part of Russia's January nuclear deal with Iran.
ITAR-TASS reports that Russia may supply Iran with two more VVER-1000 [1000MW] light water reactors for the Bushehr power station, in addition to one to be provided under a 1995 agreement. The Bushehr plant is scheduled to come on line in four years.
ITAR-TASS reports that Russia will assist Iran in completing construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The plant is expected to produce one-seventh of Iran's electricity demand and is scheduled for completion by 1995. Russian specialists are doing technical research for the project.
ITAR-TASS reports that the Russian Leningrad Metal Factory signs a $38 million contract with the Atomstroyeksport company to provide a 1,000MW turbine for the Bushehr nuclear power station in Iran. The turbines will reportedly be delivered during the second half of 2000.
ITAR-TASS reports that Zarubezhatomenergostroy (Russian company for nuclear power engineering abroad) and Atomic Energy Organization of Iran have signed three agreements: for the preparation of designs for building a mine at Saghand; for the technology design and documentation for construction of a uranium ore enrichment plant at Saghand; and for the completion of construction of Block 1 of the Bushehr power station.
Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg begins producing equipment for the primary circuit, reactor vessel, steam generator casing and internals for the Bushehr reactor in Iran.
Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg ships the 350-ton assembly kit for a nuclear reactor to the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Assembly will begin soon after it arrives in Iran, says Viktor Kozlov, general director of the Atomstroyeksport company. Kozlov says delays in construction at Bushehr are "not because of technical problems. The original construction schedule was tighter than actually needed. We wanted to speed up the works this way." Russia and Iran will sign a revised construction schedule that calls for the plant to be finished in December 2003, ITAR-TASS reports.
Izvestigya of Moscow reports that work is to begin on the second and third reactors at Bushehr (the type VVER-440 [440MW] reactors) only after the first reactor (the type VVER-1000 [1000MW light water] reactor) is complete. [Note: This contradicts a Russian official who said work would begin on the second and third reactors in November 1995. See 5 September 1995.]
"Iran is determined to resume uranium enrichment activities in order to produce nuclear fuel for 20 reactors it plans to build," foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi announces.
James Foley, a spokesman for the US State Department, says the United States wants Ukraine to refrain from making any deal with Iran that will provide it with nuclear weapons technology. Such a deal, the State Department asserts, will result in significant cuts of US aid to Ukraine. Washington has thus far refused to allow a deal between Westinghouse Electric Corporation of the United States and Ukraine that provides Ukraine with two nuclear plants, and will not allow any deal to take place until an agreement is reached on the Iranian reactor. He says the United States may even pay Ukraine for financial losses it sustains from scrapping the Iranian deal. Qol Yisrael International Service reports that the US government suspended several agreements with Ukraine in an effort to coerce it to not sell Iran nuclear turbines.
Janes Defence Weekly reports that more than 25 nations, including the United States, Russia, and Eastern European countries, are scheduled to meet in Paris under the umbrella organization, New Forum, to discuss military and dual-use export regulations and related topics such as pre-notification. The United States has made pre-conference proposals calling for a ban on sales of nuclear related items to Libya, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, and for multilateral negotiations regarding sensitive dual-use items. Russia's membership in the New Forum, the successor organization to COCOM (Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls), was recently approved after Russia agreed to conclude arms sales to Iran currently in progress, but not to undertake any further trade with Iran. Membership in the New Forum demands accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Missile Technology Control Regime, as well as agreement to abide by chemical and biological weapons accords, but does not allow states a unilateral right to veto a given export.
Jane's Defence Weekly reports that, according to Russian and Iranian sources, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev will soon visit Iran "to discuss military cooperation." Iranian defense officials insist that Grachev's visit is unrelated to the Russian-Iranian nuclear deal. Jane's reports that a growing number of Russian military officials who share US concerns about Iran's attempts to obtain nuclear weapons and who feel threatened by Islamic fundamentalism in Central Asia have expressed opposition to the Russian-Iranian nuclear contract. NATO's perceived eastward expansion and increasing rancor between the Russian military and Western policymakers, however, have muted domestic Russian opposition to the nuclear deal.
Jane's Intelligence Defense Review reports that former US Secretary of State Warren Christopher says that based on a variety of data, "we know that since the mid-1980s, Iran has had an organized structure dedicated to acquiring and developing nuclear weapons." US State Department staff also state that there is evidence that Iran is engaged in nuclear activities "not conducive to [a] strictly peaceful program." Iran's nuclear industry is growing, with 3,000 personnel working at various sites in Isfahan. A second, top-secret weapons design center is near the Caspian Sea, at Moallem Kalayeh. Two other research sites are located at the Bushehr nuclear power plant and at Sharif University. A source at the Israeli Embassy in the United States said nuclear activities at the university were likely to have been moved since the university had been under Western surveillance. "Work continues" at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, even though the plant was badly damaged during the 1980-88 Gulf War.
Javier Solana, the European Union's High Representative on Foreign and Security Policy, states while in Tehran,
Jayantha Dhanapala, the United Nation's Under-Secretary General for Disarmament Affairs, states in a press conference in the Uzbek capital that Iranian-Russian nuclear cooperation is under the supervision of the IAEA, which has yet to observe any violations. Mr. Dhanapala points out that the cooperation between the countries follows a routine economic deal aiming to access new technology.
Joao Santana, Brazil's infrastructure minister, visits Tehran to discuss the sale of $150 million worth of German-made nuclear equipment from Brazil's Angra III power station.
John Bolton, the US Under Secretary of State arrives in Moscow. According to the US ambassador to Russia, Alexander Vershbow, Mr. Bolton will meet with Russian officials to discuss the export of high technologies and weapons to Iran. Mr. Vershbow says that United States hopes that Russia will assure that it is controlling the export of sensitive technologies to Iran.
John D. Holum, the director of the US Arms Control Agency, says Iran is still attempting to build a nuclear weapons program despite information provided by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors that they are aware of no wrongdoing. Concerned that Iran's signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, which included a stipulation that it could obtain nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, Holum says Iran's objectives are obvious "in terms of their procurement activities, the kinds of reactors they're interested in acquiring."
John Holum, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, says Iran might be able to produce a nuclear bomb by 2003. [Note: In March 1997, Holum says Iran might be able to produce a bomb by 2005-2007.]
John Holum, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testifies that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, but that it would not be able to produce enough fissile material until 2005 to 2007. [Note: In 1995, Holum said Iran might be able to make a bomb by 2003.]
John Wolf, US assistant secretary of state, says that the United States failed to stop Russian nuclear assistance to Iran.
Jozef Sucha, press secretary for the Slovak Ministry of Economy, says on a recent visit to Russia by Slovak Minister of Economy Jan Ducky, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov offered to have Slovak companies provide equipment for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Ducky did not respond to the proposal, but considers it serious enough to report at the next cabinet meeting, says the press secretary. Sucha says the offer must be carefully considered because of US opposition to construction of the Bushehr plant. In Mikhailov's words, "the Slovak Republic could gain up to $20 million annually for supplies of boiler room and other equipment for the Iranian nuclear power plant." Sucha said Ducky will probably raise the issue at a future Slovak cabinet meeting. Concerned about US opposition to the Russian-Iranian nuclear deal, Sucha noted that Slovakia would only participate in the project if it did not involve political repercussions. Mikhailov adds, "From my point of view, cooperation with Slovak partners on the projects in Iran and Cuba is even more important than the construction of one unit in Mochovce."
Juergen Moellemann, the German economic minister, meets with Iranian officials to discuss German-Iranian trade. The meeting may have included talks on the Bushehr reactor, which was to be built by Siemens-Kraftwerk Union of Germany. Germany halted work on the project during the Iran-Iraq War, and the German government now claims the reactor cannot be completed because its technology is outdated and unsafe.
Just before his departure to Vienna, US Deputy Secretary of State John Bolton meets with Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyanstsev at the Russian of Atomic Energy Ministry at Bolshaya Ordynka Street to discuss Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation. He states after the meeting that, "the Russian side had presented the US with its proposals." Russian Minister Rumyanstev says in an interview regarding the disagreements between the United States and Russia, "the most important thing we have is an understanding that Russia and the United States must reach an agreement on this issue. The fact that it is not always clear how we will be able to agree on intricate matters is another matter. At any rate, we need a compromise that takes account of both countries' interests."
K. Subramanyam, a defense analyst from India, says there is little existing evidence that proves Iran assisted Pakistan with its nuclear program. This statement runs counter to a previous promulgation made by Iftikhar Khan Chaudhry, a Pakistani nuclear scientist in the United States. Chaudhry is one of six nuclear scientists that defected to the United States in protest of alleged discussions among Pakistan policymakers of a pre-emptive strike against India. Subramanyam asserts that rumors of Iranian assistance to Pakistan's nuclear program are exaggerated. "We have not heard of Iran having provided monetary or technological help to Pakistan, facilitating nuclear explosions by the latter last month," he says.
Kamal Kharazi, Iranian foreign affairs minister meets with Mohammed Al-Baradi the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Wolfgang Hoffman, the executive secretary of the organization of Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Kharazi reiterates the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear program and calls for a nuclear free zone in the Middle East. Kharazi also thanks the International Atomic Energy Agency for its support for Iran against US criticism.
A truck is stolen in Isfahan on its way to the Bushehr nuclear power plant, reportedly containing several pieces of welding devices. [Note: See 10, 13 May 1998 for more on the theft. See also 5 June 1998 for what is perhaps a related entry.]
Kamal Kharazi, Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister, says that the cooperation agenda between Iran and Russia includes completing the construction of the nuclear power station in Bushehr.
Kamal Kharazi, Iran's foreign minister, proclaims Iran's concern over the intensification of nuclear rivalries in the Middle East, hoping nations of the region will join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Kharazi, while on a visit to Ashgabat, tells IRNA that "we believe that the countries that were not prepared to join the talks on nuclear disarmament and to decide on the comprehensive elimination of atomic weapons, are guilty of causing these dangerous rivalries."
Kamal Kharazi, Iran's foreign minister, tells journalists upon his arrival in Islamabad, Pakistan that Muslim countries are pleased with advances Pakistan has made regarding its nuclear capabilities. Kharazi points out that despite recriminations from international sources, the Islamic world understands Pakistan's decision to conduct nuclear tests, a choice he believes is understandable in light of India's recent detonation of a nuclear device. Though he is pleased with Pakistan's recent success, he hopes it will use restraint to reduce tensions in the region. Sanctions against Pakistan, Kharazi states, will be firmly opposed by Iran.
Kamal Kharazi, Iran's representative to the United Nations, says Iran is committed to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East.
Kamal Kharazi, the Iranian foreign affairs minister, visits Moscow after his planned visit was postponed following divergence between Iran and Russia. [Note: See 18 February 2002.] This visit comes amid US pressure on Russia to stop its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear and missile fields. Mr. Kharazi is expected to discuss the completion of the Bushehr nuclear plant construction.
Kamal Kharazi, the Iranian foreign minister, approves of Russia's defense of the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation during US President George Bush's visit to Moscow.
Kamal Kharazi, the Iranian foreign minister, rejects allegations that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons.
Kamal Kharrazi says, "We will not allow anyone to deprive us of our right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and in particular our right to enrich fuel for our power stations." He further confirms Iran's commitment to the NPT and reassures cooperation.
Karel Samec, spokesman for Czech engineering company Skoda Plzen, says the company is negotiating a $200 million contract with Iran for consulting work at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. "In no case will we be supplying nuclear components or technology to Iran," he says. Jocelyn Greene, spokeswoman for the US embassy in the Czech Republic, says the United States opposes Czech nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Kazakh and Russian officials deny that Kazakhstan was going to sell Iran the 600k g of enriched uranium transferred to the United States if the United States had turned down the deal. Kazakh Deputy Minister Bulat Nurgaliyev denies that his country had held any talks on the matter with Iran. He adds that if the United States or the other signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty had not been willing to purchase the material, it would have been transferred under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and kept in the same storage facilities at the Ulba metallurgical plant. The report also states that experts express skepticism about the alleged plans to transfer the uranium to Iran because the uranium in question was in alloy with beryllium. According to a high ranking Russian Atomic Energy Ministry official, the technology for extracting uranium from beryllium is difficult and expensive, and Iran does not have it.
Kazakh deputy Ozhas Suleymanov says the three missing nuclear weapons said to have been transferred to Iran have been found at Semipalatinsk.
A two-person IAEA inspection team arrives in Tehran with visits to the Natanz and Isfahan facilities on their agenda.
Kazakhstani and CIS military headquarters in Moscow deny that Iran bought four nuclear warheads from the former Soviet Republic. Mohammed Mohaddesin of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, says that Tehran paid for the warheads but Kazakhstan had not yet delivered them. A commentary published in the Russian military newspaper Red Star says that the accusation is false, and that all the nuclear weapons in Kazakhstan are under reliable supervision, and that no one has the ability or the desire to sell any of them.
Kazakhstani and US officials report that in 1992-1993 Iran was seeking an agreement with Kazakhstan on purchases of low-enriched uranium (LEU) and beryllium metal from the Ust-Kamenogorsk fuel fabrication facility. According to Ergali Bayadilov, Director General of the Kazakh Atomic Energy Agency, Iran wanted to purchase safeguarded LEU to fuel the soon-to-be supplied Russian VVER-1000 [1000MW] reactor. The Ust-Kamenogorsk facility produces UO2 pellets for Soviet-design VVER-1000 reactors. Kazakstan's "chief official for nuclear materials accounting and control" and US officials says that there was no substance to media reports that Iran had sought to smuggle or steal over 500k g of highly enriched uranium (HEU) from Ust-Kamenogorsk, material that was later transferred to the United States in "Project Sapphire" [also referred to as Operation Sapphire]. According to a US official, the HEU, which had been intended for use as fuel in Soviet submarines, remained in storage at the Ust-Kamenogorsk site because the facility does not have the capacity to process HEU into LEU. US officials also say that Iran was interested in purchasing beryllium from a metal processing plant located near the Ust-Kamenogorsk fuel fabricating facility. Iran might have used the beryllium in research reactors to be supplied later by Russia. However, the Ust-Kamenogorsk beryllium is pure enough to be utilized in nuclear and missile programs as well. [Note: See 1992 entry.]
Kazakhstani Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev says that "Kazakhstan does n't supply these types of weapons [nuclear warheads] to Iran and our cooperation is based on economic projects."
Kazakhstan's Defense Minister S. Nurmanambetov denies reports that Kazakhstan sold Iran three nuclear weapons. Nurmanambetov says, "We declare that there are no nuclear weapons on the territory of Kazakhstan. The nuclear weapons were withdrawn back in November 1991. The logical conclusion to be drawn is how can it sell what does not exist?"
Ken Brill, U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, comments that the recently released IAEA report "proves Iran's October 2003 declaration of the IAEA was neither correct nor complete." Brill reiterates the U.S. position that Iran's nuclear efforts are "clearly geared to the development of nuclear weapons." The United States has again called for the IAEA to refer Iran to the UN Security Council.
Kenneth Bacon, the US Pentagon spokesman, states the United States is hopeful that statements made by Iran regarding its nuclear capabilities are true. [Note: See 7 January 1998.] But reports of nuclear component exports to Iran have provided the United States with reason to believe Iran is moving towards the development of nuclear weapons. "We don't see any signs they are stopping their efforts to develop or procure longer range ballistic missiles," he says.
A Ukrainian official says Ukraine still may go ahead with plans to provide Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant with turbines. Turboatom, the Ukrainian company involved in the deal, says it lost tens of millions of dollars by not providing Iran with the originally agreed upon turbines, and may lose more if its reputation is tarnished by the deal. The official further states, "If we do not receive real compensation for our losses from the United States, we could lose more than we have already lost."
Kenneth R. Timmerman, the Director of the Middle East Data Project, testifies before the US Senate that in 1993, US companies exported dual-use technologies to Iran, including "toxins, turbojet engines, air or vacuum pumps, machinery for liquefying gas, centrifuges and centrifuge parts, machine-tool holders, gas separation equipment, hydraulic presses, and laboratory furnaces," without proper Department of Commerce (DOC) licensing or inspection. An official from the Department of Commerce calls Timmerman's testimony "inaccurate and without foundation."
Khalil Musavi, Iran's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, does not confirm a report that the Soviet Union might rebuild the Bushehr PWRs that were damaged by Iraqi air strikes while under construction.
Khalil Musavi, Iran's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, says that Iran has been negotiating with the Soviet Union for the supply of several 440MW pressurized water reactors for about six or seven months.
Khalil Musavi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says in an interview that the Bushehr nuclear power plant will be economical, "but the important point about building atomic power plants lies in transfer of nuclear technology and transferring its new technology inside the country." He says the Bushehr "building program is in progress in accordance with our contract with the Russians, and we are not too far behind schedule."
Khatami claims that due to popular support by its people, Iran does not need weapons of mass destruction nor nuclear armament.
Khatami states Iran will extend all cooperation to the IAEA but will continue to enrich uranium.
Khusro Abedi, an official of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says the first unit of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is 52% complete and should be finished within three years. [Note: See 16 January and 27 June 2001 for differing estimates of completion.]
Komsomolskaya Pravda reports that a Russian nuclear expert said it is unlikely that China could provide Iran with a uranium enrichment facility. China utilizes the oldest and least efficient method of uranium enrichment (gaseous diffusion) and needs the fuel it produces for its reactors. Even though China bought new technology from Russia, the centrifuge plant in Shangsi will produce only four percent uranium for use as reactor fuel. As the gas centrifuge plant is still being built, there is nothing China could have sold to Iran which could help it enriches uranium, the Russian experts said. [Note: Other news sources report similar statements by Russian officials on 25 September 1995. It is not clear if this is report is based on the same statement.]
Komsomolskaya Pravda reports that Russian officials claim to have drafted the reactor agreement with Iran only after reviewing Iran's nuclear capabilities and finding them non-threatening. Potential profits from the deal exceed proposed US economic assistance to Russia.
Konstantin Shuvolov, Russia's Ambassador to Tehran, says Russia will continue its work to complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran despite rumors of Russian assistance to Iran regarding the export of long-range missiles. The Ambassador states, "The Russian Foreign Ministry has strongly rejected these rumors. Russia has only committed itself to complete the Bushehr nuclear power station for the peaceful use of nuclear energy."
Konversiya of Moscow reports that since 1992, Russia has sent 14 nuclear physicist-engineers to work in Iran. Starting in 1994, other countries from the former Soviet Union have sent 50 engineers and 200 technicians to work in Iran's nuclear industry, earning $5,000 per month.
Korea Power Engineering Company representatives travel to Iran to conduct a feasibility study on completing the plant. [Note: In January 1990, officials from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran visited South Korea to request assistance on the Bushehr nuclear power plant.]
Kraftwerk Union of West Germany expresses its unwillingness to complete work on the Bushehr reactors. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran says that the country's nuclear program is suffering because of German export controls. West Germany has also prevented Spain from finishing construction on the reactors.
A US Department of Defense official says that Iran currently is negotiating with China and Russia for the purchase of commercial nuclear reactors that could be used for military purposes.
Kuwait's Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah says that Iran's attempts to open a dialogue with Western powers would be more likely to succeed if words were accompanied by actions to renounce the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Al-Sabah says that the confrontation between Iran and the West puts Kuwait in a difficult position, as if "between a rock and a hard place." He welcomes a change in the relationship, saying that tension between Iran and the United States "does not serve our interest here."
L.P. Chromova, the director of Inor, and A. Asgharazadeh, the director of an unidentified Iranian facility, reach an agreement regarding the supply of a specialty alloy.
Labor MK Rafi Elul meets with an unknown US source, reportedly with long-time connections to the Israeli government, who states that in 1995 she gave to both the CIA and Israel Iranian government documents on Iran's successful efforts to obtain nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union. [Note: For more on this topic, see 1995, 9, 10 (2 entries), 11, 15, and 16 April 1998. 1991, 13 October, December, and 27 December 1991 entries may also be related.]
Labor MK Rafi Elul says that Israel and the United States have suspected for years that Iran acquired nuclear weapons smuggled from the former Soviet Union. Elul reportedly met with an unknown US source, reportedly with longtime connections to the Israeli government, in March 1998 who said that in 1995 she gave both the CIA and Israel Iranian government documents on Iran's successful efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.
Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's president, says his country's involvement in the construction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr will be relegated to "the electrical and not the nuclear cycle." Kuchma further asserts that the Ukraine's decision is meant to create jobs and provide the Kharkov Turboatom plant with prospects for future building contracts.
Leybold AG of Germany and an official at the Iranian embassy in Germany, Said Karim Ali Subhani, negotiate the sale of a vacuum arc remelting furnace to Iran, according to German intelligence information. The furnace was scheduled to be transshipped via India, but the shipment "apparently was not completed." According to Nucleonics Week, Subhani is a "key broker for nuclear, chemical, and biological technology." [Note: The information on the transaction is released in August 1992, and a Leybold spokesperson denies the report in August 1992.]
Lidove Noviny, the Czech newspaper, reports the Czech Republic government is reconsidering its stand on whether to allow ZVVZ Milevsko to provide the Bushehr nuclear power plant with equipment. A great many countries have already refused to provide Iran with technical assistance, a fact that supplants some of the Czech Republic's original stalwartness with reticence regarding the sale of nuclear technology to Iran. Mahmud Mohammadi, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, states "a reaction to such interference in the domestic affairs of Iran, Tehran has decided to reduce the level of its economic and political cooperation with Prague."
Literaturnaya Gazeta (Moscow), reports that Major General Vitaliy Yakovlev, deputy chief of the Main Administration of the Russian Ministry of Defense, says that reports of a Kazakhstani sale of nuclear warheads to Iran are unfounded.
London-based Arabic periodical Al-Majallah publishes a report based on an interview with an unnamed former Iranian nuclear scientist, offering an insider's look at Iran's nuclear program. According to the scientist, who reportedly lives in Europe and held an "important position" in Iran's Nuclear Energy Organization prior to the Iranian Revolution, Iran needs at least 10 years to build a nuclear weapon because construction of the Bushehr and Darkhovin reactors has been dormant for so long--17 years. According to the scientist, in 1979 Iran had a plan to create the technology to build nuclear weapons. Iran expected to have a weapon within ten years of completion of the reactors--the late 1980s. The scientist, however, says reports that Iran has acquired or attempted to acquire nuclear warheads from former Soviet republics and other countries are not true and are part of the US-led propaganda campaign against Iran. But the scientist says Iran has large amounts of uranium, enriched uranium, and plutonium, obtained from sellers in Sierra Leone and Chad. [Note: This seems to corroborate part of a report in Sabah Al-Khair that Iran illicitly brought nuclear material into the country. [Note: See 20 April 1995. The Al-Majallah report does not clearly state if the scientist worked for Iran's nuclear program after the Iranian Revolution, and if so, for how long, which raises the question of what he knows first-hand about Iran's nuclear program versus what he is conjecturing based on his past experience.]
London-based daily Al-Hayat reports that several of 13 people accused of spying on Iran for Israel were investigating the Bushehr nuclear power plant and nuclear cooperation with Russia and China.
Lt. Gen. Lance Smith, deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command, describes the updating of war plans for Iran as a "normal process," asserting that current military concerns are focused more on possible political influence in Iraq or Afghanistan, and the flow of Iranians feeding the insurgency in Iraq, than any pressure to squelch Iran's nuclear weapons program.
Lynn Davis, US Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs, says during hearings of the House Committee on International Affairs that the United States will continue to press Russia to cease cooperation with Iran in the nuclear field due to concern that Iran intends to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
M. Dimitriov, Russian deputy defense minister, rejects allegations that Russia and Iran cooperate on unconventional weapons. He says that the construction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr complies with international laws and regulations.
Mahdi Safari, Iran's Ambassador to Moscow, says attempts by the United States to infringe on the sovereign rights of two countries, Russia and Iran, do not "correspond with the ethics of international relations." Russia's promise to complete the nuclear power station in Bushehr, he believes, is symbolic of the relationship Iran and Russia should have in the field of energy development. Safari says, "Mutually beneficial cooperation between the Russia and Iran will develop further despite outside pressure." The plant once constructed will provide 5% of Iran's electricity output.
1,500 Iranian hard-line protestors gather in Tehran to denounce Iran's decision to sign additional protocol and urge withdrawal from the NPT.
Mahmud Mohammadi, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, denounces US policy towards Iran and the White House's antipodal behavior. Mohammadi says such US activities insinuate hostility towards Iran that contradicts what Iran has promised to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). "The Islamic Republic of Iran always wants the Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction," Mohammadi says.
Mahmud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, says Israel's possession of nuclear weapons points to its aggressive intentions and opposition to peace and security. Referring to a recent statement by former Israeli Prime Minister Sharon Perez that Israeli nuclear weapons ensure peace in the region, Mohammadi says it is "shameful" that a former Israeli official admits Israel has nuclear weapons at the same time Israel is loudly claiming that Iran is seeks nuclear weapons.
Mahmud Vaezi, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister, says despite the recent agreement reached between the United States and Russia, Iran believes the latter will not sway from its commitment to Iran. Vaezi states, "My impression from Yeltsin's news conference (Wednesday), is that Russia will carry out the agreement it has signed with Iran in this regard."
Mail and Guardian of South Africa reports a meeting between Reza Amrollahi, Iran's Deputy Minister of Atomic Affairs, and Dr. Waldo Stumpf, head of South Africa's Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC), took place at Pelindaba near Pretoria, where the two officials allegedly discussed a list of items needed for manufacturing nuclear weapons. Jane's Defense Review reports the meeting was arranged by President Nelson Mandela's office, which immediately rejected the idea of any kind of transfer. Conflicting reports exist regarding whether the meeting actually took place, with Tehran saying "considerable progress" was made towards acquiring aid to develop nuclear weapons. South African Defense Force officials claim a number of technicians no longer needed by South Africa's defunct nuclear program have been hired by Iran. F. "Pik" Botha, who is alleged to have been present at the meeting, said only peaceful applications of nuclear technology were discussed. [Note: See 1997 and 11 September 1997 entries for more on Iran and South Africa meetings. See 17 August 1997 for Iranian statement on this meeting.]
A US General Accounting Office (GAO) report ["Export Licensing Procedures for Dual-Use Items Need to be strengthened" (GAO-NSIAD-94-119)] says that since 1988, the United States has approved 24% of Iranian requests for shipments of nuclear-related material. The report states that the US government has approved 1,508 export licenses for nuclear-related equipment destined for "companies or sites known or suspected to be involved in developing nuclear weapons or nuclear materials."
Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, says at the United Nations General Assembly that Iran is committed to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and safeguards implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency. He says Iran's commitment to safeguards has been confirmed by the IAEA, and that Iran is open about its nuclear activities. He says that fears of violations of IAEA safeguards should be expressed to the IAEA, but that repeated, politically motivated claims of violations by some countries hurt the IAEA's ability to do its job, an apparent reference to stated US concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri indicates that Iran's relations with Russia are excellent and bilateral relations should be expanded. He further indicates that Russia is committed to completing the Bushehr nuclear power plant despite "foreign pressures."
Major General Mohsen Rezaie, the commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), dismisses an accusation that Iran is trying to obtain nuclear weapons as "just a baseless rumor." Rezai states that Iran will not allow North Korea or any other country to use Iran as a testing ground for nuclear weapons.
Major General Uzi Dayan, head of the Israeli National Security Council, tells Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that Israel is concerned about Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran. Ivanov replies that Russia is helping Iran with the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Major General Zeev Livne, Israel's military attachÃ to Washington, reports that Iran's recent successful firing of new long-range missile does not mean it is too late to prevent Iran from making progress in nuclear technology. At the same time, Uzi Arad, diplomatic adviser to Israel's prime minister, and Brigadier General Amos Gilad, head of the Research Division of Military Intelligence, say they have information regarding Russia's participation in efforts by Iran to produce nuclear weapons and long-range missiles capable of employing non-conventional warheads.
Malaysian police cite evidence that Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan sold Iran $3 million worth of nuclear centrifuge parts in 1994 or 1995 via a middleman named Buhary Syed Abu Tahir.
Marianne, a weekly published in Paris, reports that the Russian minister of atomic energy has imposed severe restrictions on nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran. The weekly adds that Russian scientists will leave Iran. Hamid Reza Asefi, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, did not challenge the veracity of these reports but refused to confirm them.
Marshall Billingslea, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, stated in his testimony in front of the Senate that "Iran is aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons, and we are concerned that the Bushehr nuclear power project is, in reality, a pretext for the creation of an infrastructure designed to help Tehran acquire atomic weapons."
Martin Indyk, assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs, testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Iran's Shehab-3 and Shehab-4 missiles are linked to its nuclear weapons program. He says Iran has a "clandestine nuclear weapons program." He says assessments vary of when Iran can produce a nuclear weapon, adding "there are large gaps in our knowledge of what is going on there because it's a clandestine program."
Maxim Shingarkin, a leading Russia nuclear expert, says that the reactor sold to Iran, a VVER-1000, can be used to produce nuclear weapons grade plutonium irrespective of IAEA inspections. He says that the reactor produces neutrons. Even if Iran returns the spent fuel to Russia, they will be able to produce plutonium with such a reactor.
Mayak Radio Network (Moscow) reports that an undisclosed portion of the uranium stolen from the Chepetsk plant apparently made its way to the Russian town of Grozny, Chechnya, where it was reportedly purchased for 280 million rubles by buyers from Azerbaijan who intend to sell it to Iran for $15 million. [Note: See also 4 July 1998.]
Mehdi Akhundzadeh, Iran's Ambassador to Pakistan, says Iran and Pakistan do not have an agreement regarding nuclear cooperation. Akhundzadeh further states Iran's missile program is solely for defensive purposes.
A US National Intelligence Estimate concludes that Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capability, indicating concern for Iran's cooperation with China. The report adds that Iran's nuclear program appears disorganized and in its early stages. US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Richard H. Solomon acknowledges that China sold nuclear-related technologies to Iran despite previous assurances from China that it would not do so.
Mehdi Safari, the Iranian ambassador to Russia, says that Iran "has never intended" to have nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction. Safari further stresses that Iran and Russia have never had any intention to cooperate on developing missile technologies, citing Iran's adherence to International Atomic Energy Agency regulations.
Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the IAEA, says that the agency has long been aware of Iran's indigenous uranium explorations efforts. She states, "This comes as no surprise to us, as we have been aware of this uranium exploration project for several years now....[I]n fact, a senior IAEA official visited this mine in 1992."
Michael Eisenstadt, an analyst with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy testifies before the US House International Relations Committee that despite the widespread belief that Iran's nuclear program is "in its early stages," US, Russian, German, and Israeli intelligence services are convinced that Iran is attempting to obtain nuclear weapons. He testifies that Iran may need approximately five to seven years to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. However, CIA officials estimate that if Iran has access to fissile material and assistance from abroad, it is likely to achieve a nuclear weapons capability in eight to ten years. Assistance from China and Russia in obtaining fissile materials and nuclear technologies may very likely accelerate an Iranian nuclear weapons program. However, a 1993 estimate by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service states that Iran could not acquire a nuclear weapons capability in less than ten years, even with the necessary funds and foreign assistance.
Michael Ryzhov, director of international relations for the Russia Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom), says that Minatom and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) have agreed on a draft contract for the completion of Bushehr-1 but are still negotiating the financing for the project. The contract will involve the installation of VVER-1000 equipment in the reactor building that was partially constructed by Siemens in the late 1970s. Minatom and AEOI still need to determine how to modify the building, which was designed for four Siemens vertical steam generators, so that it can house six horizontal VVER steam generator units. Ryzhov adds that Minatom expects to finish the project within five years.
Middle East Defense News reports that a geological survey is underway at Gorgan with assistance from Turkmenistan as possible site for 450MW power reactor which Iran is negotiating to purchase from the former Soviet Union. According to Western intelligence, Gorgan is not a civilian site and was not visited by the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1992 or declared to the IAEA. Western intelligence also reports that nuclear scientists from Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan are employed at Gorgan with salaries upward of $20,000 a month. Again according to Western intelligence reports, the Gorgan site is not funded by the Central Bank of Iran but rather Great Nuclear Plan. The reports also say that Iran allotted $4.2 billion for nuclear weapons development over the next three years.
Middle East Defense News reports that intelligence sources believe the Isfahan site is meant to contain the facilities for the entire uranium fuel cycle.
Middle East Defense News reports that Siemens has acknowledged it approached the West German government in 1987 for permission to allow its subsidiary, Kraftwerk Union, to rebuild the Bushehr nuclear power plant. But Siemens says it has "not approached the government since then." Iran has given KWU new proposals for completing the plant, but nothing has been agreed upon, according to the report. Siemens says it believes Iran now wants a gas turbine plant rather than the light water, low-enriched uranium plant, because it is cheaper.
Middle East Defense News reports that the Mojahedin-e Khalq, Iranian opposition claims that parts of the 5MW research reactor in Tehran have been moved to the Isfahan nuclear research center. The opposition also claims that the Revolutionary Guards have a secret nuclear weapons center at Moallem Kalayeh, north of Qazvin in the Elburz Mountains. The opposition also claims that Iran has created a special unit within the Ministry of Defense, led by two nuclear experts, "Dr. Nari and Dr. Musavi," to research nuclear weapons and acquire nuclear technology from other countries. The article says US intelligence sources believe Rafsanjani has decided on China as its primary partner in the nuclear field. Chinese experts are now working at the Qazvin nuclear research center. [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
Middle East Intelligence Bulletin reports that there are unconfirmed reports of a nuclear reactor in Tabas.
Middle East International reports that Russia may have been secretly assisting Iran in basic nuclear research since the 1980s, when the Islamic revolution and Iran-Iraq War led to a cutoff of Western nuclear technology. The reactor at Iran's Nuclear Research Center acquired "critical assembly capability" in 1990, which suggests that Iran, a state with little nuclear technology of its own, received assistance from Russia or Pakistan or both. Russia's December 1994 contract [signed 8 January 1995] to complete Iran's 1300MW pressurized water reactor (PWR) at Bushehr-1 would be a "logical follow-on" to such secret cooperation, although the deal is considered to be far more significant than any previous cooperation between the two countries.
Middle East Newsline reports that although US administration officials agree that Iran is approaching nuclear capability, they believe that the nature of the Iranian regime offers possibility of democratic change.
Middle East Newsline reports that the United States is trying to prevent Russia from selling a second reactor to Iran.
Mikhail Bogdanov, Russia's ambassador to Israel, says Israeli evidence purporting that Russia has given missile and nuclear technology to Iran is inaccurate. Bogdanov says "the Russian-Israeli dialogue on Iran and other Middle East issues will continue," an attitude he believes is confirmed by Deputy Foreign Minister Yevgeniy Primakov's visit with Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's Prime Minister.
Mikhail Fedorov, the chairman of the Ministry of Atomic Energy committee for international relations, says that Russia will have to open a scientific research center in Iran in order to realize the agreement on scientific and technical cooperation. Reportedly, the center will have a model reactor to train Iranian specialists. Negotiations for this center are in progress.
Mikhail Virchenko, chief engineer at Turboatom in Ukraine, says his company "is doing design work on a one million-kilowatt [1,000MW] turbine for the Bushehr nuclear power station in Iran." The Ukrainian company Turboatom was contracted by the Russian firm Zarubezhatomenergostroy (company for nuclear power engineering abroad) to design the turbine Russia needs for the Bushehr nuclear station in Iran. Turboatom hopes to sign a contract with Russia for manufacturing the turbine once the design phase is completed. [Note: See 14 February 1998.]
Mlada Fronta Dnes reports that Czech officials have been trying in vain for three months to find a way to prevent Czech firms from assisting Iran in the completion of the Bushehr nuclear plant. The Czech firm Skodaexport is trying to provide some technical assistance to Iran. Czech lawyers and Ministry officials have concluded that there is no mechanism for stopping Czech firms from offering advice abroad.
Mohamed Al-Baradi, the newly elected Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), acknowledges that Iran has maintained a positive relationship with the IAEA. Inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities indicate that the country is compliant with its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations. "Our relations with Iran contain nothing special or different from our relations with other countries," he says.
Mohamed ElBaradei, the IAEA director general, is of the opinion that "the Iranians are open to a deal" but normalized relations between Iran and the United States are a prerequisite. In talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, ElBaradei advocated a dialogue between the two countries, which Armitage said would be taken under advisement.
A US National Intelligence Estimate is released that says Iran is seeking a nuclear weapons capability.
Mohammad Husayn Mahluji, Iranian Minister for Mines and Metals, signs a letter of intent pledging Iran's interest in buying the ailing German machine tool manufacturer Magdeburg GmbH.
Mohammad Husayn Mahluji, Iranian Minister for Mines and Metals, visits Germany and signs a letter of intent to buy German machine-tool maker Sket Magdeburg GmbH. The Iran Brief writes that Iran could be attempting to repeat Saddam Hussein's approach to building nuclear weapons. Hussein in 1987 bought the British machine-tool maker Matrix Churchill, which supplied Iraq with machine tools under dual-use export licenses, some of which were found to part of Iraq's nuclear weapons program.
Mohammad Hussein Mahlujchi, Iranian Mines and Metals minister, goes to Germany to order from Kraftwerk Union a $1.4 billion natural gas power plant; construction is to begin in 1992. [Note: Kraftwerk Union is the company that was building the Bushehr nuclear power plant.]
Mohammad Javad Zarif, the deputy foreign minister of Iran, at a news conference in Geneva says that Iran is willing to implement the final document of the treaty banning nuclear tests. But he adds that the United States wants the treaty signed for domestic purposes. He further adds that from his country's point of view, the few unresolved issues remain so because of the lack of will from a few governments. Sirus Naseri, the Iranian representative to these talks in Geneva says that the treaty text is not acceptable to Iran, but that there is another prospect to end the conference in a satisfactory manner. He asserts that the treaty is very important to Iran as well as to many other developing nations and adds that Iran is endeavoring to resolve the situation despite American attempts at disruption. [Note: Iran announces on 11 September 1996 that it will sign the treaty.]
A US Republican task force reports that Iran has possessed all of the necessary components to build a nuclear bomb since December 1991.
Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister in charge of legal affairs says that Iran has the right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and that the US Congress does not have the authority to make interventions in its relations with other countries.
Mohammad Khatami, Iran's president, tells Sergei Ivanov, secretary of Russia's National Security Council, that Iran has the right to use nuclear technology. Khatami stresses the importance of adhering to international norms related to nuclear technology, stating Iran's cooperation with Russia to build a nuclear power plant in Iran is testament to Iran's adherence to international law.
Mohammad Khatami, the Iranian President, visits Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg, where equipment is being built for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Plant director Yevgeniy Sergeyev says delays in construction of the Iranian plant are not because of his company, but because the plant had been designed by a German company and had to be redesigned to work with Russian equipment. Sergeyev says Khatami told him a contract for a second unit at Bushehr would be signed as soon as the "first block" equipment is delivered.
Mohammad Mohaddessin, director of the International Affairs Section of the Iranian opposition group Mojahedin-e Khaleq, says Iran has spent $200 million on its nuclear weapons program since March 1990. [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program. See 30 June 1991 for other claims by Mohaddessin.]
Mohammad Sadeq Ayatollahi, Iran's permanent representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, says the Bushehr plant will be open in three years. He says Iran wants to reduce its dependence on oil and get 20% of its energy from nuclear power.
Mohammed Al-Baradi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, says, "We have not seen any violation of [Iran's] obligation under the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
A US State Department official says of Iran's nuclear program, "I don't think the Iranians are going about it in such a brutish fashion as Saddam Hussein. Their program is much more subtle and long-term." Further reports from officials say, "We have not established that there are any secret nuclear facilities in Iran."
Mohammed Javad Larijani, a member of Iran's National Security Council, says nuclear weapons have been "erased from Iran's policy." He notes that President Rafsanjani has repeatedly called for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.
Mohammed Mohadessin, director of international relations for the Iranian opposition group Mojahedin-e Khalq, says Iran has paid Kazakhstan for nuclear warheads but has not received them. Mohadessin's comments match US intelligence reports. [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
Mohammed Saeidi, vice president for planning and international affairs at the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says the generation of nuclear electricity is the "prime priority of Iran's nuclear program." "The people and government of Iran are determined to open their way through the tortuous path of peaceful use of nuclear technology despite all imposed restrictions and difficulties," Mr. Saeidi said.
Mohsen Mirdamadi, head of the Iranian Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, noted Iran's move toward accepting the Additional Protocol as "logical." Hojatoleslam Hassan Rowhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, says that Iran has no intention of joining the additional protocol prior to 20 November.
Mohsen Nurbakhsh, Iran's vice-president for economic affairs, declares to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that Iran will not seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction under any circumstances. Although the United States has claimed that Iran is attempting to develop chemical and nuclear weapons, Nurbakhsh states that Iran has adhered to all international agreements concerning the proliferation of chemical and nuclear weapons.
More protests are held in Tehran over the government's decision to sign the additional protocol to NPT, fueled by concerns raised by young Iranians over national security.
According to a commentary on Russian radio, cooperation between Iran and Russia is proceeding smoothly with the possibility for cooperation on future projects, but that the point of agreements has not yet been reached.
More than 600 Russian engineers are working at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Under the contract, Russia is to complete the nuclear power plant by supplying equipment, facilities, as well as fuel for running the plant. The agreement also includes provisions for the supply of $30 million worth of fuel and for the removal the spent fuel from 2001 to 2011. Sergey Tretryakov, the Russian ambassador, also says that Iran and Russia's cooperation for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will not stop with Bushehr, as the possibility for cooperation for a second power plant exists under a protocol signed by the two countries for the construction of the second atomic power plant.
Morteza Sarmadi, the Iranian deputy foreign minister, denies any nuclear cooperation between China, India, Iran, and Russia at present, but says that such cooperation is welcome.
Moscow's Segodnya reports that two Russian companies, Atommash of Volgodonsk, and Izhorsk and Podolsk Machine-Building Plants [Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg], will provide much-needed parts for the Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran. The shipment comes in light of what the Moscow daily states is Iran's "chronic electricity crisis," and will consist of window covers, atomic filters, and domed roofs.
Moskovskiye Novosti of Moscow reports that Iran will obtain nuclear weapons in 10 to 15 years.
Mostafa Tajzadeh, a member of the reform movement in the Iranian Parliament, maintains that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons, while asserting that Iran has the right to develop them. He says, "It's basically a matter of equilibrium....One the one hand Israel says, 'If I don't have it, I don't have security.' And we say, 'As long as Israel has it, we don't have security'."
MP Kazem Jalali, rapporteur of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, counts Iran's membership in the IAEA nuclear fuel cycle group as "one of the achievements Iran has gained from negotiations with Europe." He stresses Iran's potential effectiveness as part of this group.
Mr. Aqamohammadi, head of the Supreme National Security Council publicity committee, declares that Iran "will never accept total suspension of uranium enrichment" and that the negotiations currently underway are to define the guarantees "so that we can have the fuel cycle and this process can take its proper course." In Brussels, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, adds that it is "necessary for Europe to do its best to ensure that we reach a clear result in the nuclear negotiations."
A "senior official" [presumably American] says that Iran's resolve to produce nuclear weapons could result in an Israeli preemptive strike. The official says, "The date by which Iran will have nuclear weapons is no longer 10 years from now. If the Iranians maintain this intensive effort to get everything they need, they could have all their components in two years. Then it will be just a matter of technology and research. If Iran is not interrupted in this programme by some foreign power, it will have the device in more or less five years."
Muhammad ElBaradi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reaffirms the peaceful nature of Iran's and Russia's nuclear cooperation, assuring the international community that Russia's aid in helping Iran complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant will not prepare it for the production of nuclear weapons.
Muhammad Jawad Zarif, the Iranian deputy foreign minister, and Russian Foreign Mnistry official Georgy Mamedov meet concerning non-proliferation issues.
Mustafa Zarei, a Majlis deputy from Sarvestan, says Iran must counter US and Israeli propaganda by producing a nuclear arsenal. "So far we have not tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction, but it is essential for us and the Islamic world to have such weapons so as to prevent the Israeli acts of aggression," he says.
Namibian Director of Mines Asser Mudhika emphasizes that the government is working with the IAEA and that "they know the end destination of our uranium." Responding to a recent Reuters article that Iran has held a 15 percent share in Roessing Uranium Limited since 1970, Mr. Mudhika says this is not a secret.
NATO officials say all of the more than 17,000 tactical nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union have been returned to Russia. [Note: This rebuts a 2 May 1992 report that Kazakhstan sold Iran two nuclear weapons.]
According to a diplomat close to the EU-Iran talks in Geneva, Britain, France and Germany "are going to read the riot act to the Iranians" regarding quality control work accomplished on centrifuge parts, which is not permitted (whereas maintenance work is), and which they did not report.
NBC-TV reports that US intelligence reports say that Iran and Pakistan have been cooperating in making a nuclear bomb for the last two years.
News reports say Germany was unsuccessful in attempts to persuade the United States to reconsider its opposition to the Russian-Iranian reactor deal.A senior Western official revealed that in the past few months, the United States and Germany had been involved in "an informal exchange of views" on this matter, but the UnitedStates declined to openly renew consideration of the deal. OneExecutive Branch official contends that Secretary of StateWarren Christopher is the driving force behind US opposition,and that there are US officials who "see virtue in holding nuclear talks with Teheran; in part because Washington i swilling to provide power reactors to the DPRK." Although the United States and Israel have claimed that Iran has a secret nuclear program, an International Atomic Energy Agencyofficial states that "no new information has come forth which would justify a return non-routine visit [to Iranianfacilities]." Reshetnikov states that US opposition to the Russian reactor sale is based on "considerations of economic competition." A Western source indicates that Moscow will go through with the deal because the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. Russia hopes to "exert some influence" in the Middle East and Central Asia. Moreover, Russia itself has30 million Muslim citizens. Spain is reportedly also considering selling nuclear technology and supplies to Iran.An effort in the late 1980s by a Spanish Siemens' licensee to establish a supply link with Iran was unsuccessful.
Nezavisimaya Gazeta of Moscow reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked that existing economic deals between Israel and Russia to be put on hold. This comes in response to rumors that Russia is providing nuclear weapon and ballistic missile know-how to Iran. According to the Israeli daily Haaretz, a "vast number of Russian military enterprises" are involved in modernizing Iran's military industry. Israel believes that if technological assistance from Russia to Iran does not cease, Iran will eventually be capable of developing ballistic missiles with a range of 2,000k m. Yevgeniy Primakov, Russia's foreign minister, believes reports of Russian-Iranian ties to develop nuclear weapons capabilities are erroneous, saying "press reports and certain politicians' statements that Russia is allegedly helping Iran to develop nuclear weapons and long-range missiles," are completely false.
Nezavisimaya Gazeta of Moscow reports that Russia may be willing to sell Iran its S-300 air defense missile system to protect the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
According to a report by the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), there is "scarcely a doubt remaining that Iran is interested in buying nuclear materials" on the black market. The report details Iranian efforts to acquire nuclear materials on the international black market, as well as from German companies. The BND warns of the increased "professionalism" of nuclear smugglers. US CIA head John Deutch says that "Iran has attempted to obtain nuclear materials on the black market.
Nezavisimaya Gazeta of Moscow reports that the United States is apprehensive of Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran. Washington is specifically concerned that Iran may be learning about uranium enrichment from Russian scientists.
Nezavismaya Gazetta reports that future scientists at the Bushehr Nuclear plant will undergo a technology, work organization, and equipment training at the Balakovo nuclear power station. The Russian station is believed to be similar to the Bushehr plant, and will provide Iranian specialists with information pertinent to the safe management of a nuclear reactor. The Iranian specialists are expected to complete their training by August 2001.
Nikolai Shengaryov, spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, says that Russia may provide the Bushehr reactor with fuel from the newly found uranium reserves in Iran.
Nikolai Shingarev tells ITAR-TASS that Russia and Iran have reached an agreement to set the final dates of deliveries of nuclear fuel by the end of the week. Mr. Shingarev states that the two countries atomic energy agencies chiefs "discussed in detail technical issues of the nuclear power plant construction, the schedules of work, and deliveries of equipment for the first reactor of the Iranian nuclear power plant...[T]he general contractor of the construction, the Russian company Atomstoiexport, should supply and assemble 20,000 tonnes of equipment at the Bushehr nuclear power plant by the year's end."
Nikolay Kovalev, director of the Russian Federal Security Service, reports that it has gathered two years' worth of evidence regarding Iran's attempts to procure Russian nuclear and missile technology, as well as materials used in the manufacture of non-conventional weapons. Kovalev promises Russia will make every effort to stop any attempt to obtain technologies used to produce weapons of mass destruction or launchers.
According to a statement issued by the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Energy, after a third day of meetings with US officials, Russia's Minister of Nuclear Energy Alexander Rumyantsev states that Russia would take into account "political factors" before deepening its aid to Iran. US Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham says, "No one should be under any impression that there is anything but the utmost concern on this question on our part, and those concerns have been frankly and directly conveyed during our meetings here."
Nikolay Kovalev, leader of the Russian FSB (Federal Security Service), reports that President Boris Yeltsin informed him of the need to stop illegal deals with Iran regarding dual-purpose technologies. The order comes after a report last week by the Jerusalem Post said the newspaper had documents relating to an exchange made in 1991 between Russia and Iran of two tactical nuclear warheads.
Nonproliferation issues, export control and disarmament policies are discussed between the Russia and Iran at the level of directors of departments from the foreign ministries of the two countries. The two countries also discuss future nuclear cooperation.
Noremly Bin Muslim, deputy director of the International Atomic Energy Agency inspects several projects of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI). Bin Muslim meets with AEOI head Reza Amrollahi and discusses IAEA cooperation with Iran.
Norinco, a major Chinese conglomerate, denies US allegations that it aided Iran's missile program and demands that the United States lifts the penalties that were imposed on Norinco products, which include firearms and firefighting technology.
North Korea and Iran conclude a fifth joint committee meeting centered around increasing economic, scientific, and technological ties. Iranian Defense Minister Mohammad Foruzandeh led the Iranian delegation.
According to a top official at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom), a new stage of construction began at Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant after Iran made a $60 million advance payment to Russia. Minatom Deputy Minister Yevgeniy Reshetnikov said that the reactor vessel has been manufactured and experts have begun building the plant's steam generators and other equipment. Assembly of the plant's VVER-1000 [1000MW] light water reactor will begin in early 1998. The Bushehr-1 reactor is scheduled to be commissioned in 2001.
North Korea and Iran sign a nuclear cooperation agreement, according to South Korean and Arab media sources. Iran has also tested North Korean missiles in the region between Shahrud and Damghan, east of Tehran.
Nuclear cooperation plans between Iran and China are near collapse, according to "an Iranian source." According to the source, "the recent talks in Beijing showed that the positions of the two sides were far apart." Iran and China had an understanding to sign an agreement this summer for the construction of two or three nuclear power stations, the source says, but that now seems unlikely, the source says. China cannot guarantee it can provide all the parts needed for the power plants, as some are made in Germany, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. China is modifying its reactors to work without the foreign parts, but this will take four years. Also, Iran failed to give China detailed plans on how it would pay the 1.2 billion Pounds Sterling for China to begin work on the first two plants. China reportedly was not interested in payment with Iranian crude oil. Iranian sources say US opposition to Iran's nuclear program may also be a factor in delaying a deal. [Note: See 30 May 1995.]
Nuclear Developments reports that according to a Jane's publication, Chile, Iran, South Korea, and Libya are capable of producing nuclear weapons.
Nuclear Developments reports that Iran is cooperating with the Soviet Union in setting up new nuclear power plants in Iran.
Nuclear Developments reports that the Soviet minister of transport and the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran reach an agreement for the Soviet Union to assist in the construction of two 440MW nuclear plants in Iran. The two nations also agree to cooperate for peaceful purposes in the nuclear field.
Nuclear Engineering International reports that Argentina has attempted to revive work at Bushehr.
Nuclear Engineering International reports that France and Iran are continuing discussions on resolving a dispute about a $1 billion loan made by Iran to the French Atomic Energy Commission in 1974 to build the Eurodif enrichment plant. As part of the loan conditions, Iran agreed to pay part of the plant's operating costs and take 10% of the enriched uranium produced. However, after the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, Iran demanded full repayment of the Iran interest. France has paid back $630 million, but is asking for damages from Iran for Eurodif, since Iran backed out of the agreement.
Nuclear Engineering International reports that Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov said that by the end of 1995, Iran will make an initial payment of about $20 million on its $800 million contract for the completion of the first nuclear reactor at Bushehr. The payments are being arranged by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom), Russia's Alta Bank, Iran's Melli Bank, and the Iranian government.
Nuclear Fuel reports that China is providing Iranian nuclear experts with know-how and design information, some of which may be related to fissile material production and weapons development.
Nuclear Fuel reports that Chinese sources confirmed that China will continue with the deal to build a hexafluoride plant in Iran and that Iran notified the International Atomic Energy Agency of its plans to purchase the plant. Ostensibly, Iran would use the plant to convert its own uranium yellowcake deposits to hexafluroide for export. However, US officials are concerned that the plant could be used to produce weapons-grade nuclear material. In early November 1996, John Holum, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), announced that China had cancelled the UF6 plant sale because Iran could not pay for it. Apparently, by making public the possible cancellation of the deal, ACDA was attempting to pressure China.
Nuclear Fuel reports that US and European officials say that Iran, Pakistan, and India were attempting to procure materials and technologies that would allow them to purify nuclear materials using lasers.
Nuclear Fuel reports that Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Mikerindeclares that Russia and Iran "have made no agreements"regarding the future of spent nuclear fuel from the Bushehrnuclear power station. The report says the issue concerns whether the spent fuel will remain in Iran or will be returned to Russia for reprocessing. In Mikerin's words, "both side shave left open spent fuel management options." Mikerin adds that although both countries are parties to the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), neither of them has signed a contract to place Iranian spent fuel under InternationalAtomic Energy Agency safeguards. The United States wants Russia to require that Iran not reprocess the spent fuel, the report says. A senior Russian Ministry of Atomic Energyofficial considers such a requirement "beyond NPT safeguards requirements" and claims that Russia "would not initiate"discussions on Iran not reprocessing spent fuel after commercial agreements with Iran have been completed. Mikerinnotes that only the front end of the fuel cycle for the twoVVER-1000 [1000MW] reactors is addressed under theRusso-Iranian nuclear agreement. Furthermore, Mikerin says Russian environmental law mandates that if Iran chooses to return the spent fuel to Russia, Iran would have to return the fuel after 25-30 years of storage or reprocess it in Russia.Under those conditions, Iran must take back vitrified high-level radioactive waste (HLW), reprocessed uranium, and separated plutonium, which would be placed under IAEAsafeguards. Russian specialists analyzed the possibility of shipping the spent fuel from Bushehr to Krasnoyarsk-26 through the Caspian Sea and concluded that because of inadequate transport conditions in Iran, the shipment cannot be delivered. Russian specialists, however, suggest that the fuel can be shipped from Iran to Krasnoyarsk via Shevchenko,Kazakstan. Minatom's nuclear contract with the Atomic EnergyOrganization of Iran (AEOI) states that Russia is to provide the Bushehr station with the first core of low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, which will be produced at the NovosibirskChemical Concentrates Plant. The Novosibirsk Plant is expected to produce reloads for the Iranian reactors.
Nuclear warheads from Kazakhstan are reportedly transferred via Turkmenistan to Iran. [Note: See 13 October and 27 December 1991.]
Nucleonics Week reports that a French court has blocked payment of $110 million from Framatome to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Framatome was told to pay the money by the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration in Lausanne. The money is the down payment of 271 million francs, plus interest, paid by Iran for construction of two reactors at the Karun nuclear power plant. Iran cancelled the contract for construction after the revolution in 1979. The French companies Framatome, Alsthom, and Spie-Batignolles have filed a $5 billion franc suit against Iran for breach of contract. [Note: See January 1991 entry for the ICC's ruling against Framatome. See August 1991 for the court's subsequent ruling against Iran for breach of contract.]
Nucleonics Week reports that a German official and other sources say Russia has been putting pressure on the German firm Siemens AG to work with it in constructing a nuclear reactor in Iran. Germany has been resisting Russia's efforts to retransfer to Iran "advanced reactor electronic diagnostic and control technology" made by Siemens/Kraftwerk Union that the Soviet Union imported in 1989.
Nucleonics Week reports that Arab diplomatic sources do not believe the United States can substantiate its accusation that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Arab officials noted that the International Atomic Energy Agency has found no evidence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program. The officials add that because the Arab states could be threatened by Iran, they cannot support US efforts to isolate Iran.
Nucleonics Week reports that Argentine President Carlos Menem has blocked the supply to Iran of equipment for a pilot fuel fabrication plant and a uranium conversion facility. [Note: See 7 February 1992 and 2 March 1992 entries.] Argentina cancels negotiations for supplying Iran with a heavy water production plant. Iran reportedly also sought hot-cell equipment from industry in Argentina and Europe, although a US official says Iran has not obtained any equipment that can be used to reprocess fuel.
Nucleonics Week reports that Chinese officials said it is their "firm intention to export the UF6 [hexafluoride] plant to Iran." [See November 1996 and 6 January 1997.]
Nucleonics Week reports that German intelligence is investigating the possibility that earlier this year, South Africa reshipped furnace equipment to Iran supplied to it by Germany in the early 1980s.
Nucleonics Week reports that Iran has a nuclear cooperation agreement with Pakistan and secret nuclear agreements with South Africa and China, which may reflect nuclear weapons ambitions on the part of Iran. European officials express concern that Iran might seek Pakistan's assistance in enriching uranium obtained under a secret nuclear cooperation agreement from South Africa in 1988-89. [Note: See 1988-1989 entry regarding South African cooperation.]
Nucleonics Week reports that Iran's President, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani expressed interest in restarting the country's nuclear program.
Nucleonics Week reports that Italy's foreign trade minister says that Italy will not allow export of steam generators built by Breda [Termomeccanica, later Ansaldo] for Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant. Ansaldo transferred the four steam generators to Siemens of Germany, but they will remain in Italy. The generators were built by Italy's Breda for Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant, but Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Vito Lattanzio says Italy has no intention of exporting them. [Note: See mid-1976 entry on the contract for the generators. Also see 11 November 1993 entry on the seizure of the equipment by Italian customs.]
Nucleonics Week reports that Khalil Musavi, Iran's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, states that a Soviet-Iran nuclear cooperation agreement signed in 1990 will not lead to an agreement by the Soviet Union to complete the Bushehr reactors.
Nucleonics Week reports that Liu Xuehong, Chinese deputy director general of the Ministry of Energy and Bureau of International Cooperation at the China National Nuclear Corporation, says China cannot supply a 20MW reactor to Iran for "technical reasons." Iran has been seeking a 25 to 30MW heavy water-moderated natural uranium-fueled reactor. Given that Iran planned to purchase fuel cycle and heavy water production facilities from Argentina, the United States is now convinced that Iran has non-peaceful nuclear objectives. Western officials doubt that China is really unable to supply the Iranian reactor. Liu says that the reactor sought by Iran is too small to pose a proliferation threat. However, US experts speculate the reactor could be capable of producing 6k g of plutonium per year. Although the International Atomic Energy Agency does not consider such an amount to be significant, it is enough to produce a nuclear bomb. The United States has pressed China not to export the reactor. [Note: See 23 September and 17 November 1992 for entries on US pressure on China.]
Nucleonics Week reports that Majid Teymuri, director of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, has said that the plant is four months behind its timetable because of ongoing adjustments in detailed design engineering.
Nucleonics Week reports that Russian companies participating in the construction of Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant failed to supply Tehran with VVER-type reactor equipment as stipulated under an $800 million contract. Officials from the Russian firms said "metallurgical specifications" of the German equipment, installed at the Bushehr plant by Siemens, do not match specifications for the Russian equipment. According to Russian industry sources, the "optimal solution...would be for Minatom [the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy] to exactly match the metallurgy of the [Russian] equipment" with that of the equipment previously installed by Siemens-Kraftwerk Union. Such a move would greatly increase the construction costs and delay completion of the reactor until after 2003. Russian firms are having trouble fitting VVER steam generators into the German plant design, causing Iran to seek out Siemens steam generators. Iran also sought to expand participation in the project to include Western firms such as Electrowatt of Switzerland and Hochtief of Germany. However, Western firms will not join the project as long as the United States opposes it. Iran has paid Russia less than $100 million for its work, and will not make further payments until Minatom commits to a "firm completion deadline." Participating Russian companies refuse to accept such an obligation due to numerous unsolved technical problems at Bushehr, as well as concerns about paying heavy fees if the reactors are not completed on time.
Nucleonics Week reports that sources in Europe believe Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), does not control all activities at AEOI. US sources claim that Iran's secret efforts in nuclear development are organized outside of the AEOI.
Nucleonics Week reports that Spain's Equipos Nucleares, a Siemens' licensee, is interested in receiving a subcontract from Siemens to complete Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Nucleonics Week reports that the foreign affairs department of the Canadian government is expected to prepare a preliminary report within a month on plans to sell Canada's fusion energy research program to Iran. Sean Rowan, spokesman for the foreign affairs department, says the report will follow analyses by the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB) and the department "to see where exactly the components and reactor as a whole fit into existing Canadian legislation." Managers at the Canadian Center for Magnetic Fusion in Varennes, Quebec have discussed selling the tokamak reactor, related equipment, and technology to a research center in Iran. The Center expects that the Iranians would hire about 10 researchers from Varennes as consultants. However, Rowan says that a sale would not take place for a long time and would be subject to extensive export control investigation. He says "obviously, fusion reactors are currently experimental and have not been proven capable of producing commercially viable energy nor nuclear explosive devices." In addition, Rowan notes that "Canada does have a policy of controlled engagement with Iran right now. It places limits on bilateral relations with them because of certain Iranian policies in the area of human rights, support for international terrorism, rejection of the Middle East peace process, and its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction."
Nucleonics Week reports that the German government denies that it favors allowing Siemens to supply new reactors rather than complete the heavily damaged, uncompleted reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology and the Federal Ministry of Economics favor new reactors, according to the report. Engineers from Siemens and the German reactor inspectorate Technischer Ueberwachungsverein (TUeV) say that 5 to 8 billion DM would be necessary to repair the reactors.
Nucleonics Week reports that Ukraine will participate in a Russian-Iranian nuclear project by supplying a turbine for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The turbine will be manufactured at Ukraine's Kharkiv Turbatom factory, which has manufactured turbines for nuclear facilities in Cuba, Finland, and Bulgaria. According to the terms of the contract, Ukraine will supply the 1,000MW turbine and other equipment to Iran by the end of 1998. The Sumy Pump Factory, which produces pumps for nuclear power plants, is expected to participate in the $50 million project. The United States is expected to pressure Ukraine to cancel the deal.
Nucleonics Week reports that unless the United States ends its antagonism to Iran's nuclear development program, senior Iranian officials said, Iran will not sign INFCIRC-540 (the "Additional Protocol" for more intrusive IAEA safeguards). A senior Iranian diplomat told Nucleonics Week on 8 May that some disarmament and arms control Iranian officials have proposed committing Iran to INFCIRC-540, but "Tehran always replies by asking us whether signing it will mean that the US stops harassing our nuclear development program, and so far the answer has been no." Iranian officials point out that their country signed and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) yet the United States "persists in making claims that we have a program to produce chemical weapons. Our implementing the CWC has n't stopped the US from continuing its propaganda war against our industry." The Iranian diplomat also noted, "So we have no assurance that if we agree to the Additional Protocol, the US will stop attacking our nuclear program." Iran has never been cited a violation of its safeguard agreement and remains a member in good standing of the NPT. However, as one European safeguards official stated, "It is generally understood but never publicly acknowledged (by the IAEA), that Iran is one of the key targets, not Australia or Sweden." [Note: See 1 June 2000 and 31 May 2002 for more on Iran and the Additional Protocol.]
Nucleonics Week reports that US officials have said China has not met the conditions for President Bill Clinton's certification of China's nonproliferation credentials, which would enable the 1984 Sino-US nuclear cooperation agreement to enter into force. A possible compromise is a "partial certification," which would allow contracts to be signed but not allow transfers of components. China's assistance to nuclear programs in Pakistan and Iran are the primary obstacles to certification. Specifically, US officials are concerned about China's recent statement that it intends to sell a uranium hexafluoride (UF6) plant to Iran. The plant would convert uranium oxide to UF6 using gas centrifuges. China may also be preparing to sell a heavy water weapon-grade HEU research reactor to Iran. The United States wants China to stop using HEU in its nuclear fuel cycle, and to pledge not to export HEU-fueled reactors.
Nucleonics Week reports that, according to Iranian officials, China will construct a minimum of two pressurized water reactors at Bushehr. Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, names the Chinese reactor project Esteqlal. An Iranian official says his country has already made a "down payment" on the reactors and wants "to see some results."
Numerous US congressmen ask the Bush administration to utilize economic sanctions against Iran and private corporations that deal with the Iranian regime. In a congressional hearing, state department officials admit using diplomatic pressure against European governments and corporations to cancel oil and gas contracts with Iran.
Obninsk State Technical University of Atomic Energy administrators deny Western media reports that their institution is training Iranian specialists in nuclear energy. The university director tells Interfax that the university offers the Iranians a number of three-month Russian technical language courses, no more.
Occupied with Iraq's weapons of mass destruction controversy, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency Dr. Mohamed El Baradei had to cut short his long-awaited inspection of Iran's unreported nuclear sites in Natanz and Arak. The IAEA has consequently decided to reduce the scope of its inspections in Iran.
Officials from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran visit South Korea to request assistance on the Bushehr nuclear power plant. [Note: In February 1990, Korea Power Engineering Company representatives travel to Iran to conduct a feasibility study on completing the plant.]
Officials in Russia confirm that they will stop a shipment of a laser isotope separator to Iran, which the US government believes will be used for the production of weapons grade uranium. Yuri Bespalko, the head of public relation for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry says in an interview that depending on approval by US and Russian commissions, the deal could proceed. Boris Yatsenko, the director of Microtechnology at the Yefremov Scientific Research Institute, the laboratory that was going to sell Iran the laser says that the laser, which is only 15-20W, is "intended 'only for medical, industrial and scientific purposes'." Also, at 15-20W, the laser is considerably lower than the 40W threshold imposed by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a group of 34 countries that agreed to impose export controls on dual-use material that could be used for weapons production. The US Enrichment Corporation, a private nuclear fuel provider that inherited the US government's laser program says that though the technology works, it does not yield enough uranium to make it viable.
According to a US government source, Iran is interested in setting up a consulate in Aktau (formerly Shevchenko), Kazakhstan. The United States is concerned about Iran's intentions, since Aktau houses Kazakhstan's fast breeder reactor, which can produce at least 110k g of plutonium a year. [Note: The Aktau reactor is used to generate electricity and to desalinate water. Russia was discussing the supply of a water desalinization reactor to Iran.]
Oleg Velichko says besides the Bushehr project, there are "other projects in Russian-Iranian cooperation aimed at using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes." He does not specify the projects but notes that they "will not give Iran the possibilities to use nuclear technologies for military purposes."
On a state-run Tehran radio report, China's First Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei says that, "China will continue its cooperation with Iran on the peaceful use of nuclear energy within the framework of regulations set by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and considers this a principled and correct policy."
On a trip to Israel, Li Lanqing, Chinese deputy prime minister, says China is not providing nuclear cooperation to Iran. "We will not do anything that could harm you," he says. "You can relax." David Levi, Israeli foreign minister, says, "We expect China, as a country which wants to contribute to peace, to do everything it can to curtail such dangers which could lead to war."
On a trip to Washington, DC, a Russian official hints that Russia might reconsider its nuclear deal with Iran if the United States were to buy Russian uranium. "If the issue of uranium shipments is solved, then the Russian-Iranian agreement can be considered from another point of view," says Oleg Davydov, foreign trade minister and deputy premier. "We are strategic partners of the United States and therefore can hold talks on the 'nuclear deal' issue," he says, adding "one may understand the US concern over the possibility that Russia can provide technologies for Iran which would allow it to accelerate the creation of nuclear weapons." He adds that Russia is committed to non-proliferation, and says "we are not going to transfer nuclear technologies to anyone; including Iran."
On his way to Iran, I.K. Gujral, Indian external affairs minister, says he will not discuss nuclear cooperation with Iran on his trip.
On the fourth day of meetings with Iran in Geneva, the discussion has turned to the possibility of a European mission to acquire a light water reactor versus the heavy water reactor the Iranians want to build, which would present less of a proliferation concern.
One day after the U.N.'s atomic watchdog presented a report on Iran's nuclear record, the U.S. IAEA ambassador, Jackie Sanders, says "The IAEA is still not able to provide assurances that Iran is not pursuing clandestine activities at undeclared locations." IAEA Director Mohammad ElBaradei added that Tehran needs to take steps to dispel doubts "through transparency measures and co-operation with the [IAEA]."
According to Agence France Presse, IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming claims, "The first [IAEA] mission is leaving on Friday [to Iran] and what will follow will be a lot of talks and inspections." Fleming says the IAEA is "moving forward with a very detailed and intense plan of work," regardless of Salehi's comments, since nothing official had been sent to the IAEA on Iran's behalf.
Owner of Ray Amiri Computer Consultants, Reza (Ray) Amiri, and the firm's operations manager, Mohammad (Don) Danesh, plead guilty for illegally shipping nuclear weapons and missile guidance systems components to Iran. Amiri and Danesh are convicted on 19 counts, including falsifying customs declarations and exporting controlled commodities such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, pulse generators, and a universal programming system to the Ministry of Defense in Tehran. [Note: See 29 August 1991 for their arrest.]
Pakistan dismisses an old report about a meeting between Iranian officials and AQ Kahn. The story was originally published by the Washington Post 18 year ago. Foreign Minister spokesman, Masood Khan, said "it's recycling of an old story...and does not warrant a substantive response from us."
Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister Husayn Haqani denies reports of an Iranian-Pakistani cooperation agreement on nuclear technology. He says Pakistan would not export nuclear technology. [Note: See 1991 (2), May 1991 (2), November 1991 for more on cooperation between Iran and Pakistan.]
Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Jalil Abbas Jilani rejects a report that Pakistan will hand over centrifuge components to UN inspectors which could be compared with machinery sold to Iran. An IAEA spokesman declined to comment, but diplomats close to the IAEA said the parts would arrive soon. Mr. Jilani said, "Pakistan has not been asked to give centrifuges, nor will Pakistan do so."
Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan rejects media allegations at a weekly press briefing and declares that Pakistan has not extended any nuclear cooperation to Iran.
Pakistani General Mirza Aslam Beg proposes to create a strategic alliance with Iran, including the sharing of nuclear weapons technology. The plan is scrapped by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Pakistan and Iran currently receive a large amount of nuclear-related assistance from China, raising the possibility of three-way nuclear trade in the future.
Pakistani government officials downplay allegations from a newly released CIA report that A.Q. Khan provided more assistance to Iran's nuclear program than previously revealed. Khan is said to have provided "significant assistance" to Iran, including designs for Pakistan's older centrifuges, as well as for more advanced and efficient models and components. Although pardoned by Pakistani President Musharraf, Khan is still under house arrest in Pakistan.
Pakistani information minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, confirms A.Q. Khan gave centrifuges for enriching uranium to Iran, "but the government was in no way involved."
According to an Iranian military source, Iran made a formal request to China regarding the dispatch of an Iranian observation team to China's next scheduled nuclear test. Iran also requested training for ten or more Iranian personnel at Chinese nuclear weapon test sites.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf announces he may provide the IAEA with uranium enrichment components to clear Pakistan's name from Iran's nuclear program. "We will give you them and you examine them...but once and for all," President Musharraf said. The parts would help establish the origin of the uranium contamination discovered in Iran and if Tehran has been secretly developing nuclear weapons.
Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar asserts that Pakistan has not and will not export nuclear technology to any country. "Neither we are [sic] helping the Iranian nuclear programme nor [do] we intend to do so."
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif denies rumors that Pakistan is helping Iran rebuild and upgrade a research reactor. [Note: See 2 November 1991.] Pakistan refuses Iranian offers to purchase nuclear weapons technology in exchange for writing off Pakistani debt.
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif denies that Pakistan might help Iran rebuild a 20-year-old nuclear research reactor. [Note: This refers to research reactors that were supplied by the United States in the 1960s under the atoms for peace program].
Paris Match, a French weekly, reports Tehran is investing $2 billion per year to develop its nuclear capability.
According to an Iranian official, IAEA Deputy Director for Department of Safeguards Pierre Goldschmidt leads a team to Tehran for discussions on the implementation of safeguards.
Paul Muenstermann, vice president of the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), says that Iran received two of three nuclear warheads and medium-range nuclear delivery systems that are missing from Kazakhstan. Iranian officials and the commander of the CIS Joint Armed Forces reject these claims. Russian General Victor Samoilov, however, who handles disarmament issues for the CIS general staff, admits that three nuclear warheads were missing from Kazakhstan. Also, Iran allegedly purchased four 152m m nuclear shells from the former Soviet Union, which were allegedly stolen and sold by former Soviet Army officers. The Iranian Foreign Ministry denies these allegations. Lt. General Sergey Zalentsov, senior commander of the United Armed Forces of the CIS and deputy-in-charge of all CIS nuclear arms, also rejects the reports. Iran reportedly received the warheads from Kazakhstan through Bulgaria. However, Iran did not receive the necessary launch codes or missiles capable of carrying the warheads. [Note: See 16 March 1992 entry for the response from Russian and Kazakh officials.]
Pavel Sarkisov, rector of the D.I. Mendeleyev Russian Chemical-Technical University, says that his university had nothing to do with the sale of missile technology to Iran. Sarkisov says that the university deals with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, that the Department of Physical Chemistry trains specialists and conducts studies of zirconium for the nuclear industry, but this research is not secret and does not involve the export of nuclear technology. Sarkisov adds that the university has no contracts with Iran in the areas of zirconium research or the burial of spent nuclear fuel, and has not trained personnel for Iran in the past 15 years, although an Iranian post-graduate at the university is conducting non-military-related research on the synthesis of polystyrene. [Note: See 12 January 1999.]
Penuell Maduna, Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister of South Africa, says previous allegations of South Africa's collaboration with Iran over the latter's development of nuclear weapons technology are erroneous. He further asserts that the only meeting Dr. Waldo Stumpf, head of the Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC), or any other AEC official had took place in a public restaurant in 1996 in Cape Town with Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, Iran's then petroleum minister. The meeting he reports, was part of a plan to set up a possible oil storage agreement at Saldanha. [Note: Aqazadeh was appointed head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran on 3 September 1997.]
According to an unidentified Minatom spokesman quoted by Interfax, Iran has still not signed the Spent Nuclear Fuel agreement, which was prepared last month by the Atomic Ministry. The agreement dictated that all spent fuel from the Bushehr reactor will be sent back to Russia. The unidentified official says that "Russia will not supply nuclear fuel to the Bushehr nuclear power plant until an agreement on the [spent fuel's] return to Russia is signed." Russia's Atomic Minister Alexander Rumyantsev is quoted as saying that Iran was not being uncooperative regarding Bushehr with Russia. He states "on the contrary, at the general conference the Iranians proclaimed the complete openness of their nuclear activities."
Phil Williams and Paul N. Woessne state that recent incidents in Turkey and Germany indicate that Iran is seeking high-quality nuclear material.
Physicists from Tblisi State University and at least one plasma physicist from the former Soviet Union have accepted offers to work for Iran.
Pinar Bakir, a Turkish businessman and economics professor, is arrested in Turkey for possession of 2.5k g of uranium, which he was allegedly smuggling from Russia to Iran. Four Iranians and four Turkish citizens are arrested in the raid while trying to purchase the uranium from Bakir. Police suspect the four Iranians of working for SAVAMA, the Iranian secret service. Police identify Turker Gelendost, who is among those arrested, as the central figure in the smuggling of the uranium from Russia to Turkey. According to chief of the police anti-smuggling department, Salih Gungor, visitors from Russia brought the uranium into Turkey, where they sold it to Turks. Deputy Head of the Turkish Cekmeci Nuclear Research Center Erol Balikcigil announces that the smuggled material "only has about 2.5 to 3.5% uranium-235 and cannot be used in nuclear weapons manufacture." Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Borujerdi denies that Russian uranium is destined for Iran, calling the case a plot to undermine Turkish-Iranian relations and stating that Iran is willing to cooperate with Turkish security forces in the matter. Iran continues to deny that it is attempting to develop nuclear weapons. Another Iranian is being sought in connection with the case. The uranium was to be sold for $40,000 per gram. However, a specialist at the Cekmeci Nuclear Research Center estimates that "the whole amount was worth only a few thousand dollars."
According to an unidentified senior State Department official, Russia has been pressuring Iran to open its facilities to intrusive inspections, warning that it may delay or put a halt to Russian assistance with the construction of the nuclear reactor at Bushehr if Iran does not follow through with its promises to the IAEA. However Nikolai Shingarev, spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, rejects the assertion that work might stop on Bushehr, and reaffirms that Russia would in fact "do its best to expedite the process."
Post-Soviet Nuclear &amp; Defense Monitor reports that, according to Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs Lynn Davis, the United States continues to try to persuade Russia not to provide Iran with four nuclear reactors for the Bushehr nuclear facility, arguing that "such technology is dangerous in the hands of Iran." Thus far, Russia has refused to cancel its $1 billion nuclear contract despite a law passed by the US Congress withholding $195 million in aid to Russia for weapons dismantlement. The Russian journal Novaya Yezhednevnaya called the sanctions "unfair considering that the US provided the same light water reactor technology to North Korea."
PPNN Newsbrief reports that Iran is facing difficulties in locating funding for the Russian completion of its Bushehr reactors and is seeking to import less costly VVER equipment from unfinished reactors in Eastern Europe. The US government reportedly has pressured Poland not to respond to an Iranian request for components from the uncompleted Zarnowiec plant where the Soviet Union had been building two VVER-440 type reactors. The United States also is said to have urged Germany not to allow the transfer of parts from the Greifswald plant in the former East Germany to Iran.
Preparing for a possible attack by the United States, Iran publicly states it "would respond within 15 minutes to any attack...and it is sharpening its abilities to wage a guerilla war."
President Bill Clinton, at the end of the nuclear safety summit held in Moscow, states his opposition to the nuclear cooperation between Iran and Russia and asks that Russia ends its assistance.
President Bush announces diplomatic steps will be taken to convince the mullahs to give up their nuclear ambitions. National Security Advisor, Stephen Hadley, indicated the president may still consider offering incentives; a tactic the Europeans are utilizing on Iran. Responding to suggestions that the United States is preparing to bomb Iran, Bush says they are "ridiculous" but "diplomacy is just beginning...and all options are on the table." Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany says "we absolutely agree that Iran must say no to any kind of nuclear weapon, full stop."
President Clinton and former President Bush convince Russian President Boris Yeltsin to kill negotiations with Iran on the sale of a natural-uranium-burning [heavy water] reactor. Such reactors can be used to produce weapons-grade fissile material. [Note: See previous 1993 entry on Russia and heavy water reactors.]
President Clinton signs the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, an act which allows him to take punitive measures against any individual or organization that provides any material aid to Iran's nuclear or any other WMD program. The legislation also cuts considerable funding from the US-Russian space station project unless Russia is determined to have demonstrated a commitment to oppose Iranian nuclear weapons program. Sergei Ivanov, the secretary of the Russian Security Council says in an interview that Russia assisting Iran in a weapons program would be like giving them a "grenade with a pulled out pin," that could "be hurled back at Moscow." The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the legislation by saying that the bill may considerably affect US-Russian relations particularly in the field of nonproliferation and export controls.
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani criticizes alleged American propaganda, stating that Iran's strict adherence to the tenets of Islam do not allow attempts to develop "destructive and antihuman nuclear weapons..." This exclamation comes as part of a report conducted by the Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in which Rafsanjani reiterates Iran's cooperative relationship with the International Atomic Energy Agency to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani inaugurates the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran's (AEOI) new research center in Tehran.
President Khatami announces, "The Iranian nation is not after a war, violence or clashes, but the world must know that the Iranians will not tolerate any invasion" and decries U.S. threats as "psychological warfare" in line with its "expansionist policies." Iranian nuclear negotiator Rowhani describes a possible assault on Iranian nuclear sites as "the most stupid move." Defense Minister Shamkhani dismisses the possibility of a U.S. attack, saying "Iran is not a small country like Iraq; wherever they attack us, they will be attacked."
President Mohammad Khatami stated at a July 6 meeting that "while the Islamic Republic of Iran is the front runner of nuclear disarmament, we are being accused of trying to obtain these weapons. We are seeking nuclear technology only for the development of the country and not for any other purposes." On July 2, state radio condemned allegations by German intelligence chief August Hanning that Iran is working on a secret program to enrich uranium for use in weapons. One day before Khatami's comment, Kazakhstan security forces detained three people who were smuggling Uranium-235, which "was expected to be brought to Afghanistan and then, ...to Iran," Moscow's NTV reported.
According to an UPI analysis, although there is a consensus amongst the reformist and right-wing figures and bodies in "seeing the [October] deadline as an affront to Iran's national dignity," divisions within Iran's political circle have come out over how to react to IAEA's October deadline. Different groups show dissenting views on cooperation.
President Mohammed Khatami insists on Iran's right to peaceful nuclear technology, noting that opinion polls indicate a plurality in favor of proceeding with same.
President Rafsanjani and Jiang Xinxiong, the president of the China National Nuclear Industrial General Corporation, meet to discuss the construction of a 300MW nuclear power station in Iran. China promises to provide the technology and equipment for the construction of the nuclear power station.
Prior to a meeting with SNSC Secretary Rohani, the EU head of foreign and security policy Javier Solana expresses the hope and belief that the matter of Iran's nuclear program would not be referred to the UN Security Council. Solana also tells reporters that he thought Iran had thus far been honest with the European Union. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell later comments that Solana's evaluation was premature given Iran's past dissembling. Separately, Russia's atomic energy minister Alexander Rumantsyev remarks that in the absence of evidence against Iran, "sanctions are unacceptable;" Iranian IAEA envoy Salehi suggests that the EU draft resolution for the IAEA board meeting is forward looking and makes no reference to the possibility of having the case brought before the UN Security Council.
Prior to talks in Moscow, Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, confirms plans to build another reactor for the Iranian government. The reactor will be a 20% enriched uranium reactor for research purposes. Adamov says he and his Iranian counterpart, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, will discuss the lack of progress made on the construction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr, Iran. Yevgeniy Adamov further calls "for the expansion of cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy between the two countries," though he states any work on additional nuclear power plants may delay completion of construction of Iran's Bushehr plant.
According to David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has a peaceful nuclear program. In a news conference at United Nations headquarters in Vienna, Kyd stated that the IAEA has regularly inspected Iranian nuclear facilities and has never observed anything, which would indicate that the Iranian nuclear program has any military purposes. Kyd also said that the IAEA is cooperating with Iran to promote the highest international safety standards at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He reminded his audience that Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its nuclear facilities are permanently under IAEA supervision. In addition, Kyd said the IAEA has not received any intelligence from the United States that indicates that Iran is using its nuclear program for producing weapons. The United States and other Western countries have an embargo on numerous dual use items because they believe Iran is using its civilian nuclear program to prepare for producing nuclear weapons. US officials have criticized the IAEA inspections, because they claim that the IAEA failed to detect Iraq's large nuclear program in the 1980s.
Priroda of Moscow publishes an interview with Russian Atomic Energy Minister ViktorMikhailov in which he discusses in detail Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran. Mikhailov says Russia's nuclear contract with Iran does not violate the 1992 framework agreement. He says the agreement refers to "average-capacity"reactors, not any specific wattage, "so we have no violation of the agreement." [Note: Mikhailov's comments on this matter appear to be in response to an article by Aleksey Yablokov,chairman of the Russian Federation Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission for Ecological Safety. See 2 June1995.] According to Mikhailov, the German Siemens firm completed 70% of the work on the first reactor at Bushehr and45% of the second reactor. [Note: In January, an Iranianofficial said the reactors were 90 and 60% complete,respectively. See 7 January 1995.] Mikhailov says there are two research reactors operating in Iran, one built by the Chinese and the other built by the United States. He also says Iran has four nuclear facilities that produce isotopes for agriculture and medicine. Mikhailov asserts it would be economical for Iran to extract its own uranium, but its ore reserves are complex with little uranium content. He says Iranapproached Russia about building a uranium mine, and Russiareplied that the establishment of a fuel cycle including extraction and enrichment of uranium should be discussed after at least two of the reactors at Bushehr are finished. Russiahas a $1 million contract with Iran, he says, to examine how Iranian uranium can be best processed. The contract expires at the end of the month, he says, and he expects it to be terminated. Mikhailov says the Russian government authorized the sale of 2,000 tons of uranium to Iran, but the authorization expires at the end of the year and Russia and Iran have not been able to agree on a price. "It is unfortunate that we could not conclude a contract," Mikhailovsays. "They insisted on their low prices. Perhaps because they do not have any special need for uranium at present." [Note:It is not clear from the interview when the Russian government authorized the sale of uranium, perhaps as part of the framework agreement in 1992 or as part of the 1995 contract.]Russia asked Iran why it needed that amount of uranium,Mikhailov says, to which Iran replied that "they wanted to have customer-supplied raw materials to supply research reactors with fuel."
Proliferation Issues reports that the head of the Israeli Defense Forces Intelligence Branch, Major General Uri Saqi, warns that Iran is within 10 years of developing nuclear weapons capability. At least nine Western firms and dozens of nuclear scientists are involved in developing the Iranian atomic program. A senior Israeli government source said that Israel would not sit passively by while Iran develops its nuclear program but would use all options to stop it.
Proliferation Issues reports that the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) has issued a report that says Iran does not possess nuclear weapons and even with outside help, it will take Iran more than 10 years to develop nuclear weapons. Russian FIS experts said three factors that inhibit Iran's nuclear weapons program include the weakened state of Iran from the Iran-Iraq War, the great dependency of Iran on foreign assistance in technology and science, and the low level of development of Iran's industry. The report states that Iran has attempted to overcome its lack of technology and science through buying "dual-use" technology from other countries as Pakistan and Iraq have done. Russian FIS experts said that Iran carries out research on nuclear energy at Karaj, Tehran, and Isfahan, with increased attention being given to the Tehran facility. Since 1968, a 5MW research reactor that uses nuclear fuel enriched to 93% has operated at the Tehran plant. The Russian report concludes that despite concerns over statements made by both Iranian leaders and foreign intelligence services that Iran will soon develop a nuclear bomb, there is no evidence to substantiate such claims.
Qol Yisrael reports that Russia has once again denied that ties between Russian and Iran exist regarding transfers of unconventional weapons technology. The Russian ambassador to Israel in a meeting with Yuliy Edelstein, Immigrant Absorption Minister, says collaboration between Russia and Iran is solely for peaceful purposes.
Qol Yisral reports that Israel's ambassador to Kazakstan received a "commitment" that Kazakstan had not sold nuclear warheads to Iran and does not intend to do so in the future because it wishes to strengthen its ties with Israel and western countries.
Radio reports from the United Kingdom report that the first group of Iranian nuclear scientists will go to Russia in March 1999, as part of a contract related to the Bushehr nuclear power project. Thirty-eight Iranian nuclear engineer specialists will soon leave for Russia, where they will receive training in nuclear energy. The students are expected to stay in Russia for 13 months or more.
Rasfanjani criticizes France for not supplying highly enriched uranium to Iran, and says Iran can get it elsewhere, such as China and North Korea. [Note: On 8 July 1991, France refused to give Iran access to enriched uranium. See also 10 July 1991.]
Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, Iran's new Defense Minister, reasserts that Iran's nuclear programs are for peaceful purposes, while at the same time stating Tehran is ready to establish an alliance with Arab states to ensure regional security.
Refael Eytan, Israeli Agriculture and Environment minister, says US attempts to improve relations with Iran could be beneficial if "it leads to a more moderate Iran and dissuades the Iranians from attaining nuclear and other weapons."
Refael Kohen, director of the Ministry of the Interior, files an affidavit that says the High Court of Justice in Israel believes Israeli citizen Gregoriy Luchansky is trading in radioactive materials and the company he owns is providing nuclear information to North Korea and Iran.
According to Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA), the IAEA confirms in its report on Iran that it has not found any evidence that Iran had used nuclear material to develop weapons, although it could not rule out the existence of nuclear materials that had not been declared. Iran has agreed to cease its enrichment program on 22 November and invited the IAEA to monitor. Iran is still facing a 25 November IAEA compliance deadline or else face sanctions by the Security Council.
Referring to a Washington Post report that U.S. drones have been over flying Iran seeking evidence of a nuclear weapons program for over a year, Iranian Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi asserts, "Most of the shining objects that our people see over Iran's airspace are American spying equipment used to spy on Iran's nuclear and military facilities."
Refuting Azerbaijan's Turan news agency's report of the capture of equipment with nuclear missile applications, the Iranian Embassy says the detainment of the truck does not involve Iran and is solely an attempt by Israel to divert attention from its nuclear stockpile. [Note: This entry is related to entries on 17 April and 5 June 1998 for other reports involving a truck carrying nuclear materials.]
Regarding the Iranian issue, ElBareidi states that the finding of different levels of enrichment and different isotopes raises questions over where the enrichment took place. He claims this information needs to be clarified along with the origin of any equipment involved. In regards to testing of centrifuges, IAEA experts claim "testing with nuclear material must have taken place for Iran to reach the stage that it has." Various scenarios that need to be examined include contamination of equipment, importation of enriched uranium, enrichment inside Iran and possibly a combination of the above. ElBaradei seeks answers by end of November.
Reports say China is Iran's most important nuclear trading partner, selling over $60 million worth of equipment per year, although Iranian scientists have reportedly been disappointed with the quality of some of the Chinese equipment. Fourteen Chinese nuclear experts are currently working at Iranian nuclear facilities.
Reports say Iran and North Korea have been making secret weapons deals and have been attempting to expand nuclear research cooperation programs. Iran has already received nuclear weapons technology from North Korea.
A 32-year-old Iranian citizen, Reza Teymiri, is arrested in Russia in connection with acquiring nuclear technology for Iran, according to Vladimir Orlov, the director of the Russian center for political studies. [Note: The 14 and 18 November 1997 entries may refer to the same arrest.]
Reports say Iran has received nuclear weapons technology from Brazil and India.
Representatives from China, India, Iran, and Russia sign a protocol in Moscow establishing the Asian Fusion Research Foundation to cooperate in the study of nuclear fusion. The final agreement is to be signed in Montreal during an August 1996 expert conference sponsored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Russian officials say financial support for the project was not discussed at the meeting. Western authorities believe the cooperative fusion research will probably aim to establish a tokamak, and, because no fissile materials will be produced, will not pose a proliferation threat. Western officials doubt that the project will receive enough financial support to generate important fusion engineering innovations. [Note: The foundation is also called the Asian Foundation for Thermonuclear Studies. See 29 February and 29 March 1996.]
Representatives from the Russian Atomic Ministry deny any other deals for cooperation with Iran once the Bushehr nuclear power plant is completed. They say, however, another unit could be installed at the Bushehr power plant. There have still not been any discussions on this issue, as all depends on the implementation of the Bushehr project. The Russian officials, however, do not rule out further cooperation at the end of this project. The Bushehr agreement provides for the putting in place of two VVER-1000 light water reactors at 1000MW capacity each and two VVER-440 reactors at 440MW capacity each.
Responding to a recent statement by Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, President Khatami says Israel "would be making a mistake" if it carried out an implied threat to eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iranian Air Force General Seyed Reza Pardis went further, stating that should Israel attack Iran, it would be "digging its own grave."
According to Die Welt, "Tehran is working to develop missiles and nuclear weapons." The Federal German Intelligence Service (BND), reports Iran's decision to expand its arms industry may provide it with similar in-roads to procure nuclear weapons. The BND further states "Iran is striving to control either nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium prospecting to reprocessing. In so doing, knowledge is also gained that can be used to build nuclear weapons."
Responding to Kuwaiti environmental concerns, Hamid Reza Asefi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, declares that IAEA experts confirm that the Bushehr nuclear power plant currently under construction complies with all international standards. Bushehr is due to launch in 2006.
Responding to President Bush's State of the Union accusation that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear arms, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi says the charge is baseless. Top nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani stresses, "We have never attempted to develop nuclear weapons and the idea has no room in our defense strategy." The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition group, has asserted that Iran has experimented with "a crucial triggering mechanism for a nuclear weapon."
Responding to Washington's recent ratcheting up of rhetoric, Iranian ambassador to Britain Mohammad Hossein Adeli declares to BBC radio that "despite irregularities in the past" Iran is now committed to a cooperative stance with the IAEA. Adeli stressed Iran's right to develop nuclear technology while accusing the United States of "false accusations."
Reuters reports that arms control experts from the Nuclear Control Institute (NCI) in Washington, DC sent a letter to US President Bill Clinton warning him against rushing into implementing the 1985 US-China Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Agreement; the issue is expected to be discussed during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's October 1997 visit to Washington. NCI President Paul Levanthal pointed out that China could be shipping excessive quantities of heavy water to Pakistan, and that China gives assistance to Iran's nuclear energy program as well.
Reuters reports that Lieutenant-General Gennady Yevstafyev, a senior official of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), says that Russia will proceed with the nuclear reactor sale because the SVR officials "have no grounds for changing our assessment vis-a-vis Iran."
Reuters reports that Russia will build a nuclear power plant in Iran. Eduard Akopyan, head of the Russian state company that builds atomic power plants abroad, Zarubezhatomenergostroy, says that the Iranian plant will have two modernized pressurized water reactors. Construction is expected to take seven to eight years. Western governments are expressing concern about the safety of the Russian plants. However, Sergey Shoigu, head of the State Committee for Emergency Situations, rules out the possibility of a major accident.
According to documentation provided to the IAEA, Iran's Pakistan connection appears to have been established around 1987, after Iran tried unsuccessfully for years to develop its own enrichment capabilities. A Pakistani-designed centrifuge proved the key to Iran's technological problems, finally permitting some forward progress in its research although even after almost 20 years, it apparently has yet to produce sufficient fissile material for a bomb. The documents provided by Iran make no specific allusion to Pakistan, only to its "signature technologies."
Reuters reports that Slovakia has offered to help Iran with the construction of the Russian nuclear power plants by providing technical aid on matters such as security and safety, but Iran has not yet asked for help, according to a Slovak official.
Reuters reports that the Clinton administration has complained to the Russian government that Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran exceeds the restrictions Russian President Boris Yeltsin promised two years ago. An anonymous US official also said Washington is concerned that Russian technical advice to Iran's uranium mining and processing efforts could eventually help Iran build a nuclear bomb. According to the official, if Iran acquires the ability to mine and process uranium, it could either enrich it to weapons grade, or irradiate it in a nuclear reactor to produce plutonium.
Reuters reports that the United States has secretly negotiated to bring one-half ton of highly enriched uranium to the United States from a poorly protected site from Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan. The US clandestine operation named "Operation Sapphire" retrieved enough uranium to build 20 to 50 nuclear weapons. [Note: The Sunday Times of London says 20 bombs, Reuters says 50.] The 600k g of uranium was secured by 31 nuclear specialists from the Ulba metallurgy plant in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic. The Russian government, which still considers Kazakhstan under its "sphere of influence," agreed to sell the uranium to the United States for what is rumored to be in the "low tens of millions of dollars." The US operation was initiated after rumors arose that Iranian scientists had recently obtained beryllium and low-enriched uranium for Iran's nuclear weapons program from the Kazakh plant, a conclusion the Kazakh government denies.
According to Efraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister, the United States has failed in its attempts to contain Iran's nuclear capability. Sneh said that Israel must to continue to build a wall of deterrence against Iran "perhaps different and greater than the one we have today." Referring to Iran's missile arsenal, Sneh stated that "it's clear that such missiles with such a large radius and warhead capability are not intended to solve their problems with Iraq, their enemy neighbor." Sneh implied that Israel might try to stop the progress of Iranian nuclear projects, but did not give specifics. He said "there is a list of other things ... but I'm not sure they should be discussed publicly." In the past, Sneh has expressed that Israel should think about launching a pre-emptive strike against Iran to destroy its nuclear facilities.
Reuters reports that the US State Department warned Ukraine against selling nuclear or conventional weapons to Iran or other outlaw states. A State Department official says the Ukraine had assured the United States that it would "exercise restraint in arms transfers to areas of concern."
Reuters reports that Yuri Kotov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry department that deals with Iran, said that Russia does not plan to concede to US pressures and will go ahead with the $1 billion nuclear reactor agreement with Iran. Kotov stresses that the Russian-Iranian deal is based on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, much like the US-North Korean agreement. The Russian contract includes one reactor, with the possibility of three additional reactors to be constructed at a later date.
Reuters reports the Canadian Center for Fusion Magnetics, is currently discussing plans to provide Iran with nuclear technology know-how and an experimental reactor. [Note: See 9, 14 July 1999.]
Reza Amrollahi, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, calls "baseless" US accusations that Iran will use Russian help to develop nuclear weapons. Amrollahi points out that as a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran has the right to receive assistance in the development of peaceful nuclear technologies. Amrollahi says that the first unit of a power plant at Bushehr will be completed in four years, and would have a generating capacity of 1,000MW. He said that 200 Russian and 500 Iranian experts and technicians are working to complete the plant.
Reza Amrollahi, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that the two 300MW nuclear power plants that will be constructed by China will be ready in nine years.
Reza Amrollahi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, says that the Bushehr nuclear power plant will soon be producing 1000MW of energy. He says that Iran's nuclear programs are strictly peaceful. He says Iran is interested in expanding its nuclear cooperation with Russia, particularly in the construction of more nuclear power plants.
According to experts at the Georgian Institute of Physics, laboratory tests show that the 920 grams of uranium, which was seized in Ajaria, is up to 30% enriched uranium-235. The experts say that this type of uranium is no longer used in Georgia and therefore the substance is probably from a foreign source. This type of uranium is typically used at nuclear power stations. In response to press reports that the uranium was destined for Iran, the Iranian Embassy in Tbilisi has issued a protest against these allegations. [Note: See 1 May for Iranian denial.]
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Agency of Iran, announces that subsequent to the signing of the agreement with Russia for the completion of the Bushehr power plant, "the construction of the first phase will be completed and it will join the national grid by the end of the second economic, social, and cultural development plan." Amrollahi says that the Bushehr nuclear power plant is worth over $10 billion in today's economy because of the investments previously made for its construction. He further comments on Germany's refusal to deliver some equipment and documents despite a ruling given by a Geneva arbitration court, and adds that Russia is demonstrating political independence by accepting to work on the Iranian nuclear power plant.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Agency of Iran, says that US allegations of Iran's military nuclear program is an attempt to blemish Iran's as well as other Muslim countries' reputations around the world. He says that the Bushehr power plant is strictly for peaceful uses and that the first reactor of the power station is going to have an output that will meet the country's total demand for electricity. He goes on to reveal that Iran is planning to sell its share in the French uranium enrichment plant. He goes on to reaffirm Iran's firm stance behind the principles of the Non-Proliferation Treaty as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency. He also explains that the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran functions directly under the control of President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), says that Iran has established the "center for research and application of radio process" in Yazd province. Amrollahi added that the AEOI is building a second Tokamak nuclear fusion research reactor.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), says that Iran has successfully produced nuclear materials instrumental for nuclear medicine. He also says that the AEOI has "successfully engaged in 178 cases of expansion of technology transfer and innovation." The AEOI also "provided its industries with 120,000 industrial radioactive forces" between 1989 and 1994. An Iranian television program featuring the Karaj nuclear facility says that Iran can produce "30 million-electron-volts proton ion and 15 million-electron-volts deuteron ion used in nuclear physics and radiochemistry."
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov deny a report of a secret deal to build two nuclear reactors in Iran. "There is in face just one contract," Mikhailov says, "to finish the construction of the first reactor unit at Bushehr--and the work is scheduled to be completed in four-and-one-half years." [Note: See August and 5 September 1995 entries for reports that a deal was signed for two 440MW reactors.]
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, breaks ground at the site for the nuclear research center at Bonab. He says the research there will be for "agricultural purposes." It is scheduled to open in July 1995. The Iranian press has called it a "cyclotron center" for research in nuclear medicine and agriculture. [Note: See January 1995.]
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, criticizes Israel's Air Force commander for saying that Israel may take military action against Iran's nuclear installations.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, denies allegations by Western intelligence sources that Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons and declared that Iran has completely complied with the requirements of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. He also refutes a recent report by the British Broadcasting Corporation that Iran is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons technology from Kazakhstan. Amrollahi says, "We don't have a bomb, nor are we seeking one. We oppose nuclear weapons because of our convictions." Amrollahi also declares that Iran had completed work on five of twelve projects for finding uranium and says, "We hope to produce and sell uranium to the world some day."
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, inaugurates Iran's first graduate degree in nuclear engineering. Over 40 foreign nuclear experts will assist in teaching the post-graduate courses. However, the nationality of the foreigners is unclear. Iran rejects western allegations that the program proves that the Islamic Republic is seeking nuclear weapons.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, meets with Mexican Energy Minister Fernando Hiriart in Mexico City. Iran and Mexico sign a nuclear cooperation agreement that calls for the exchange of scientific and technical information about nuclear energy and for cooperation in nuclear security.
According to German intelligence reports, Iran possibly imports uranium-melting technology from Pakistan. Pakistan acquired this technology from the company Urenco in the mid-1980s.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, refutes Western allegations that assistance from Russia will result in the development of nuclear weapons in Iran. Amrollahi says Iran is "completely open to international monitoring" and will place "any facility" at the International Atomic Energy Agency's disposal for inspections at "any time."
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says "Iran is not capable of making atomic bombs. Our objective in promoting nuclear industries," he says, "is merely its peaceful use specially in the field of atomic energy and its application in agriculture and medicine."
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says $780 million has been allocated for completion of the Bushehr power plant, $200 million of which will be paid in rials.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says 25% of the $780 million cost of construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant will be paid by the supply of goods to Russia. Also, Iran will pay Russia in rials for "local work," he says. [Note: The price of the contract has variously stated as $800 million and $1 billion, most often $800 million. See 7 and 8 January 1995.]
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says China has supplied Iran with one small research reactor and will supply another. [Note: Iran's planned nuclear cooperation with China seems to have been scaled back in recent days. On 18 May 1995, Amrollahi said Iran hoped to buy two or three nuclear power plants from China. See 21 May 1995 entry for a report that Iran's nuclear cooperation with China was near collapse. See 1 June 1995 for a report that Iran signed a deal for two new Chinese reactors.]
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says his nation "respects efforts aimed at the elimination of atomic weapons in the region," but believes his nation must have room to make independent decisions. Reiterating Iran's adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Amrollahi says Israel has not been in full compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran has successfully developed laser technology and produced zero-power and miniature reactors.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran may cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of future nuclear power plants as a "logical consequence of the unacceptable attitude of West Germany since the victory of the Islamic revolution." He says Iran is waiting for a decision by West Germany on the completion of the Bushehr nuclear power plant "to take appropriate measures."
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran plans to sell its share in a French uranium-enrichment plant.
According to Haaretz Iran will hold negotiations with the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry (Minatom) to procure a 40MW nuclear reactor. Western sources also assert that Iran seeks a supply of heavy water to aid in the production of plutonium for weapons manufacture. Such an agreement would violate an agreement between Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and US Vice President Al Gore. Haaretz also adds that Professor Gerald Steinberg, an arms control expert at Bar-Ilan University, believes if Iran is interested in nuclear research, it already has a 5MW research reactor that does not produce plutonium to conduct analyses. Viktor Mikhailov, the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, reasserts that Iran is still not in a position to build a nuclear weapon. Mikhailov further asserts transparency is possible since "Russia will build the nuclear power plant in Bushehr not partially, as supposed, but on a turnkey basis, since Iran is not capable with its part of the work."
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran will have several nuclear power plants in the next ten years.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran's nuclear cooperation with China is within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency. He says the United States is making "feverish propaganda on Iran's nuclear potential."
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran's nuclear program is suffering because of export controls, despite the country's adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and full-scope safeguards. He also says the International Atomic Energy Agency is emphasizing its safeguards role to the detriment of its promotional role, and adds that no developing country has diverted nuclear material from a power plant for military use.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says said the upcoming operation of the cyclotron facility at Karaj is a sign of Iran's emerging capability to manufacture radioisotopes. Amrollahi says that Iran found uranium deposits in Saghand and Bandar-e Abbas.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that a Russian television report on the Bushehr nuclear power plant erroneously stated that Iran was technically capable of building a nuclear weapon. The Russian report "is completely contrary" to Amrollahi's statements. [Note: See 16 March 1997 entry for more on the television report.]
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that Iran is holding talks with both China and Russia the possible purchase of four nuclear reactors. The Chinese units are two 300MW reactors based on Westinghouse design but built in China. The Russian units are of the VVER-440-213 type. Amrollahi said the reactors meet IAEA safety standards and would be used for peaceful applications
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that of all the countries in its region, Iran has the most self-sufficient industries for peaceful nuclear technologies.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that stricter International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards have complicated the nuclear industry and have made it costly for developing countries to build nuclear projects.
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that the country's first nuclear power plant [Bushehr] will become operational by 1999. At the same time, Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says that work has begun on the Bushehr power plant. He states that "making use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes is something without which a country could not find its real standing in the world."
Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, states that the world is not invulnerable to nuclear aggression. He adds that nuclear arsenals are not yet eliminated and the Non-Proliferation Treaty of is not yet universalized. Despite this, he says there are still encouraging signs that there are developments being made. He adds that the complete eradication of nuclear arms and of the means of producing these devices should be supported, adding, however, that an international agreement distinguishing the production of material for military and peaceful purposes should be clearly outlined.
Reza Amrollahi, Iranian Vice President and President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), says at the International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference that Iran intends to continue construction of the Esteqlal nuclear plant in Bushehr as part of a two-year-old bilateral cooperation agreement with China. According to an Iranian official, Iran would prefer to receive technical assistance from the United States and Europe, but because of the West's reluctance to supply Iran with the necessary nuclear technology and equipment, Iran has been forced to turn to China and Russia for assistance at Bushehr. [Note: The Federation of American Scientists reports that the Esteqlal nuclear plant is at Darkhovin, not Bushehr. See 1993 entry on Esteqlal. Note: See July 1991, October 1991, 31 October 1991, and 29 September 1994 for additional information on China's role in the construction of Bushehr.]
Reza Amrollahi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, tells the New York Times that Iran is planning to build about ten nuclear reactors within the next 20 years. Further plans include training Iranian researchers by Chinese nuclear physicists and nuclear engineers.
Reza Amrollahi, the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization, says that the first nuclear power plant in Bushehr will be completed, with Russian assistance, in 1999. Amrollahi also confirms that Iran intends to build two more power plants with production capacities of 300MW each with China's help.
Reza Amrollahi, the president of Iran Atomic Energy Organization, says at an International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors meeting that Iran will complete the nuclear reactors of Bushehr.
Richard Perle, chairman of the Defense Policy Board, says that Russia's Soviet-era debt should be forgiven. Such action might help persuade Russia to stop its nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Risk Report reports that Western intelligence sources said Iran has obtained gas centrifuge design data and is now seeking component technology that will enable its military to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapons program. Particularly worrying, said senior US officials, according to the report, is a potential deal between China and Iran which would see the transfer of a "turnkey" facility to convert uranium to hexafluoride gas. Centrifuges use hexafluoride gas to enrich uranium. Iran has already received Chinese assistance in mining, purification, and fuel fabrication. US officials said that given the fact that reactor-grade uranium is easily obtainable in the world market there is no rationale for Iran's efforts to build or acquire centrifuges other than a nuclear weapons program. "Foreign officials" said Iran has been trying to buy a fluorine production plant from France. Hexafluoride gas production requires fluorine. Iran is said to have attempted, without success, to purchase fluorine in 1991 for the Sharif University of Technology. Atomic Energy Organization of Iran disclosed that Iran is trying to exploit its own uranium sources in the Saghand region of Yazd province, although a February 1992 inspection revealed there were fewer than two dozen workers operating drilling rigs at the site. Also, it is reported that Iran wants to buy 2,000 tons of Russian natural uranium, ostensibly for the Bushehr reactor project. As the Bushehr reactors are not expected to use natural uranium, US officials express concern that the uranium is actually destined to be enriched and used in bombs. The US officials raised similar concerns in connection with the visits of Iranians to Kazakhstan during 1992-93 to buy low-enriched uranium.
Risk Report states that pro-Israeli lobbying organizations such as the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) view the United States as the key to halting Iranian nuclear development, and have been urging legislation to penalize foreign companies trading with Iran. In April 1995, AIPAC supported a bill by US Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) to ban trade between US companies and firms abroad known to export sensitive technology to Iran and Libya. One Pentagon official observes that this legislation "scared the White House to death," prompting a ban on trade with Iran. [Note: See 30 April 1995.] Fearing a nuclear-capable Iran, an anonymous Israeli government analyst explains that "in strategic terms, Iran has become the most important threat" to Israeli security. Efraim Kam, a political observer at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for International Studies, contends that the threat from Iran will grow in the near future due to the end of the Iran-Iraq War and because "Iran is run by a radical regime that desires to change the status quo."
Robert Nigmatulin, Russian deputy minister of atomic energy, says that Iran does not have the technology to separate plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel and will not be able to develop such technology on its own.
Rose al-Yusuf of Cairo reports that Egypt has received "a dangerous report...whether by accident or design, from a European capital" of Israel's intentions to bomb the nuclear power plant near Bushehr, Iran. The report says Israel would only attack the facility if it seemed imminent Iran would invade neighboring countries. Israel could damage, but may not be able to completely destroy, the nuclear reactors, the report says. [Note: Israel bombed Iraq's Osirak reactor at Al-Tuwaitha in 1981, but this did not eliminate Baghdad's nuclear weapons programs.] Israel would need the United States' approval to carry out such an attack.
Rossiyskaya Gazeta reports that Russia has almost completed construction of the first unit of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr. Russia will earn around $1 billion for the completion of the first unit. About 1000 Russian specialists are currently working on the second reactor at Bushehr. Many potential suppliers and builders of atomic power plants have backed out of cooperating with Iran in the nuclear field due to US pressure.
Russia and Iran agree on a timetable for payments for construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant after a meeting in Tehran between Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksey Bolshakov and the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Reza Amrollahi. The first payment will be before the end of 1995.
Russia and Iran agreed to expand their nuclear cooperation to include three additional VVER-640 pressurized water reactors as part of the Bushehr project. Russian is already assisting Iran with a VVER-1000 nuclear reactor at Bushehr, which should be completed in 2004. So far, Russia has received $50 million of the $800 million deal. With the addition of three VVER-640 reactors to the project, the total cost of the Bushehr project will extend upwards of $4.5 billion.
Russia and Iran are negotiating the construction of additional reactors at the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, says Aleksandr Rumyantsev, Russian Atomic Energy Minister. "These intentions are true but no documents have been signed yet," he says. As for construction delays, he says, "if there was some lagging in the construction schedule we will catch up with it soon. All contract commitments will be fulfilled." According to a report, the main equipment for the reactor will be delivered in July and installation will begin in September. [Note: See 11 May 2001.]
Russia and Iran issue a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, following a bilateral meeting in Tehran.
Russia and Iran sign a contract for the construction of two additional reactors at Bushehr. According to an official of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, they will be light water VVER-440 [440MW] nuclear reactors, and construction will begin in November. [Note: Other sources report that the deal was signed in August 1995. See August 1995 entry. Russian and Iranian officials have made and will make several confusing remarks about the deal. See 24, 29 August, 7, and 12 September 1995 entries.]
Russia and Iran sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) at the conclusion of Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Adamov's meeting in Iran. The MOU is a cooperative action meant to promote and eventually establish a consortium between the two nations for the building of a second unit of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, as well as "new generation" power plants in Iran. Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says the speed of the work on the plant has increased appreciably since the signing of the MOU. Proof of this, he further states, is the completion of the "metal chamber" of the plant while the "concrete chamber" will be completed with the next few months. The MOU also provides for modifications to the pay schedule, while promising a completion date will fall within the originally projected 52 months. An exchange of academicians as well as information on nuclear sciences to increase Iranian nuclear know-how are also provided by the MOU.
Russia and Iran sign a nuclear safety agreement, which will bring Russian inspectors to the Bushehr nuclear power plant in one month. Yuriy Vishnevskiy, chairman of Russia's Nuclear Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety (Gosatomnadzor), and Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, sign the agreement.
Russia and Iran sign an additional protocol to the contract for the supply of a VVER-1000 [1000MW light water reactor] to Iran. The protocol adds $140 million to the contract and calls for Russia to make changes to the foundations at Bushehr and redesign the turbine room so that the Russian reactor components can be fit into the modified structures. Iran had originally planned to undertake this work itself. The major work will begin in 1996.
Russia and Iran sign an agreement in Tehran in which Russia pledges to uphold and monitor international safety norms, as they continue to honor their contract with Iran to build the nuclear reactors in Bushehr. The agreement also states that the norms will be enforced even after the completion of the project.
Russia announces it has captured 22 tons of nuclear missile parts destined for Iran from Russia via Azerbaijan. Natan Sharansky, a minister in charge of Israeli-Russian relations, speaks with Yevgeniy Primakov, the Russian Foreign Minister, about assuaging Israeli fears over Russian nuclear-technology transfers to Iran. Yediot Aharont of Tel Aviv opines that Russia made the announcement because of fears the United States will institute sanctions against Russian companies allegedly guilty of transferring nuclear technology to Iran. [Note: See also 7 April 1998.]
Russia brushes aside US criticism and declares that it had agreed with Iran to speed up building the Bushehr reactor and to consider constructing another reactor. Russian Atomic Minister Aleksandr Rumyantsev states, "We always tell our American colleagues that all Iran-Russia cooperation is in accordance with international regulations and the resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency." Iranian Vice President Gholam Reza Aqazadeh concurred and says, "We agreed to speed up the completion process of the Bushehr power plant....A second subject we have agreed upon is to carry out feasibility studies for a second power generation unit. We hope to start a joint study in the next few months."
Russia confirms that work is to begin on a nuclear reactor at Bushehr. [Note: A Russian official said on 18 August 1995 that construction would begin in November or December.]
Russia declared that it does not intend to evacuate Russian experts and their families from Bushehr due to the Iraq conflict even though Bushehr is located 300 miles from Basra.
Russia denies that CIA-provided intelligence information proves that Iran's nuclear program has a military dimension, and says it will never give in to US pressure. The Iranian deal will be extremely profitable for Russia, and US pressure is regarded in Moscow as the result of economic competition, because the net profit from the nuclear deal with Iran can bring Russia $7 to $8 billion. Only the United States and Russia have capabilities to produce absolutely safe reactors, and Russia argues that the VVER-1000 [1000MW] light water reactors (LWRs) it will sell to Iran are safe and cannot be used for military purposes. Russia is afraid that there will be a repeat of the deal with North Korea, when US pressure led to the replacement of Russian contractors with US contractors. According to Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma International Relations Committee, there is a remote possibility that Russia will be allowed to join the North Korean project and sell nuclear reactors to North Korea.
According to Haaretz, Israel's Director of Military Intelligence Major General Aharon Ze'evi says, "by the summer of 2004, Iran will have reached the point of no return in its attempts to develop nuclear weapons."
Russia denies that Iranian students trained at the Baltic Technical Institute were provided with sufficient expertise regarding nuclear missile technology. The head of the training program at the Institute says no leakage of "sensitive technologies" was transferred to any of the Iranian students.
Russia expresses concern over the spread of weapons to other countries, and it identified certain areas of concerns. In varying degrees, Russia is concerned about Israel, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Taiwan, Syria, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Algeria, Egypt and South Korea.
Russia gives assurances to Canadian Foreign Minister Bill Graham, who is visiting Russia, that it had taken steps to ensure Iran could not use the Bushehr reactor to produce nuclear weapons. Mr. Graham says, "The Russian have a vested interest in making sure this plant works in such a way that nuclear materials don't get diverted to improper uses... I got very good assurances form the minister [Alexander Rumyantsev] that the Russians are serious about monitoring and controlling and they'l l make sure that Bushehr does not become a place for diversion of materials."
Russia is negotiating with Iran to build five or more nuclear power plants, Yevgeniy Reshetnikov, the Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister says. Possible sites are being examined, including Bushehr, Karun, and an area near the Caspian Sea. Reshetnikov says he does not know when a contract will be signed. [Note: See 16 April 2001.]
Russia issues a statement proposing cooperating with Iran on nuclear safety, which would be applied to Iran's "peaceful use of nuclear power."
Russia issues Decree No. 388, which provides the basis for a Russian export control structure. A potential problem in the current export control structure is that Georgii Khizha, who heads the Export Control Commission, also heads the Commission for Military and Technical Cooperation, which is assigned to promote the export of Russian defense items. As a result of such bureaucratic inconsistencies, Russia decided to sell two nuclear plants to Iran.
Russia must honor its nuclear agreement with Iran, says Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma's Security Committee. "Russia is a sovereign state and it has the right to choose who to do business with and what to sell," he says.
According to Husayn Abedini, a member of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, "there is no doubt that Iran is intensifying its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons arsenal. If they continue to make progress at the current rate, they will have their own nuclear capability within five years." [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
Russia proclaims that agreements with Iran made by Gazprom, Petronas, and Total regarding the construction of Bushehr's nuclear power plant are legitimate, and that any collaboration with the Iranian government over the nuclear technology is "based solely on peaceful relations."
Russia proposes to assist Iran in deploying a constellation of communication and earth-monitoring satellites. The project would be run by the Spurt Scientific-Industrial Center, with the satellites being developed by the Reutov Machinery-Building Scientific-Industrial Association. If deployed such a system would allow Iran to keep track of its neighbors and may even lead to regional stability. Or the system could be used for targeting of unfriendly neighbors. Whether such a system is affordable for Iran is unknown.
Russia provides assistance in uranium mining in the areas of Saghand and Yazd in Iran. Though Russia has denied the allegation, the atomic ministry acknowledges that the uranium mining in Iran was planned at a small scale.
Russia rejects a US proposal to increase quotas regarding satellite launches in return for Russian promise to end construction of Bushehr power plant. [Note: See 11 March 1998.]
Russia rejects further US pleas to halt construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran.
Russia releases a proposal to build a total of six reactors in Iran over the next ten years, four at Bushehr and two at Akhvaz. Russia will bid for the construction after completing the first reactor at Bushehr in 2003 or 2004. The proposal might be signed by Russian and Iranian officials at a September meeting in Tehran. The proposal also includes major cooperation in non-nuclear energy development in Iran. [Note: On 12 July 2002, the Russian atomic energy minister said nuclear cooperation with Iran would be limited to Bushehr.]
Russia says it will not change its policy on Russia-Iran cooperation in using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes despite the recent capture of an Iranian citizen who was attempting to procure dual-use nuclear technology. [Note: See 18 November 1997 entry on the arrest of an Iranian citizen.]
Russia signs a contract with Iran to sell two VVER 440MW reactors that use enriched uranium, which Iran needs for nuclear weapons development. [Note: ITAR-TASSreports that a deal is signed on 5 September 1995 for two440MW reactors. See 5 September 1995 entry. See 29 August 1995for the denial by Russian and Iranian officials of a deal for additional reactors.] The reactors will probably be installed at the Neka complex, which was unknown to the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency before now. Iran and Russia insist that there are no illicit activities involved in the reactor transactions. The IAEA maintains that Iran's recent activities do not signal a move in a dangerous direction, but others contend that the IAEA is repeating the same error it made with Iraq. The deal is made after a visit to Moscow by an Iraniandelegation, and it is signed during a reciprocal visit by a Russian delegation to Tehran later in August. [Note: Thisprobably refers to the Russian delegation to Iran led by Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Reshetnikov.See 17 August 1995 entry.] The Iranian delegation, which included Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Agency of Iran, and Sayyid Mohammed Rasuli, head of the Isfahan NuclearCenter, went to Moscow to work out details concerning the Iranian-Russian deal for the completion of two reactors at Iran's Bushehr power plant. [Note: See 7 August 1995 entry for more on the meeting.] The <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> of Londonreports that the Neka facility, located in an underground bunker, "is one of a network of highly sensitive Iraniannuclear research establishments," and a part of Iran's nuclear weapons program, dubbed "The Great Secret Project." US StateDepartment spokesperson Nicholas Burns says the StateDepartment cannot confirm reports about the Neka deal, stating that "We have seen the reports...We can't confirm them; we don't have independent verification of them." According to an unnamed US official, the Clinton administration was unaware of the Neka deal, but will conduct an investigation.
Russia strongly defends its decision to complete construction of the Iranian nuclear reactor and accuses the United States of "double standards" in its efforts to force Russia to terminate the project.
Russia Today reports that advertisements placed in the Iranian press by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran say that Iran seeks to recruit engineers to receive training in Russia for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The advertisements say that a total of 225 engineers were needed, with expertise in physics, nuclear physics, mechanical engineering, or computer science. Applicants must be Iranian nationals, and successful candidates will be sent to Russia after a short period of training in Iran. The advertisements appeared despite the recent imposition of sanctions on Russian research institutes, and threats to curtail space cooperation, by the United States.
Russia will fulfill all contracts for weapons exports to Iran signed before 30 June 1995. That is the date when Russia signed the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission agreement pledging not to enter into contracts with Iran for military hardware or expanding military-technical cooperation after 1999. Sergey Ivanov, secretary of the Russian Security Council, stated that while Russia is not entering into new contracts with Iran, fulfilling the obligations on contracts signed in 1992-1993 is important for the country's prestige and business reputation. Ivanov stressed that Iran is under IAEA safeguards, and Russia welcomes IAEA inspections of the civilian nuclear power plant in Bushehr.
Russian Ambassador Iran Sergey Tretyakov says the financing problems with the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant have been solved. [Note: See 20 November 1995 for his statement that financing problems were hindering construction.]
Russian Ambassador to Iran Sergei Tretyakov confirms that Russia will help Iran build a nuclear power plant, indicating that a preliminary agreement has been reached but that financing is still being negotiated. Financial problems stall Russia's assistance to Iran in the construction of a nuclear power plant in Bushehr and in the completion of a second plant started by Germany but abandoned for political reasons. Iran has requested that Russia fund the projects, but Russia has refused due to its own financial crisis.
Russian ambassador to Iran Sergey Tretyakov announces Russia will not sell nuclear power plants to Iran.
Russian Ambassador to Iran, Sergey M. Tretyakov, says Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran is peaceful, reiterating that Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and has been monitored by inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Russian ambassador to the United States, Alexander Vershbow, says of the US-Russian disagreement over Russian Bushehr, "In my view, Russia should be concerning itself with its own security and global security and should for this reason be far more vigilant and should be preventing the transfer or technology and know-how that could accelerate Iran's development of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. Experts of both countries are in no doubt that Iran is attempting to procure this technology. So this is, in actual fact, a question of security, not economics. But at the same time many fields of cooperation of Russia and the United States, which could be very profitable economically, have been blocked on account of our concern at the leaks of technology and know-how. And while this concern persists, very profitable cooperation in the aerospace and nuclear sphere cannot move forward."
Russian and Kazakh officials deny a report in the German magazine Stern that Iran acquired two nuclear devices and their delivery systems from Kazakhstan. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Ivan Krylnik says, "All nuclear weapons are under the strictest centralized control and selling them or stealing them is impossible." The spokesman for Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev says, "Our president has more than once emphasized that our nuclear weapons are under safe control" and that Kazakhstan is "living up to it obligations on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons." However, the US magazine US News and World Report quotes an unidentified high-ranking Russian officer as substantiating a US intelligence report that three short-range nuclear weapons have disappeared from an arsenal in Kazakhstan. The US magazine reports the weapons have been sold to Iran. [Note: See March 1992 entry for comments by the German intelligence service on the matter. See 17 March 1992 entry for the denial of a CIS general.]
Russian Atomic Energy Deputy Minister Yevgeniy Reshetnikov says Russia has begun implementing its contract to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He says the ground is now being cleared prior to installing equipment and water and power lines, which is to start in April. He also says Iran and Russia have agreed to train Iranian nuclear experts at a Russian nuclear power plant 42 kilometers from Voronezh. [Note: According to another report, they will be trained at the Novovoronezh power plant, 42 kilometers from Voronezh. See 25 October 1995.]
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev confirms that Russia will take back the spent fuel from the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He says Russia completed a protocol with Iran in November 1998 that said Russia would take the spent fuel. Russia passed a law in 2001 to allow the import of the spent fuel, and Russia and Iran will sign the protocol in September or October, he says. The reactor will be finished in December 2003 and in operation by 2005, he says. "Construction of the first power unit is nearing completion," he says. "Heavy equipment is being supplied, along with the reactor's body, pipes, and pumping equipment. In August, a turbine will be delivered."
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev confirms that uranium enrichment equipment to Iran was supplied by the Western European company Urenco and not Russian companies. He states that part of the uranium enrichment equipment found in Iran bears Urenco markings. Previously, Urenco management had claimed that the centrifuge production technology was stolen from them two decades ago.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev says that Russia and Iran have reached an agreement in principle that mandates that all spent nuclear fuel from Bushehr's first unit will be returned to Russia for storage and processing during the entire period of Bushehr's operation.
According to information from the Israeli embassy in India, India and Iran have agreed to cooperate in nuclear research and development, and India has sent nuclear experts to Iran.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev says that Russia and the United States must reach an agreement regarding Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran. He adds that the Russian cooperation with Iran is respectful of international regulations and that Iran has signed all the documents required by the International Atomic Energy Agency and that the IAEA has carried out more that 60 inspections in Iran without finding any proof of any illegal activities.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev says that Russia will meet all the commitments to the nuclear power plant in Bushehr.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev says that the construction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr remains "a sensitive topic." He stresses that the reactor cannot be used for the production of nuclear weapons.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev says, "We see no other future work with Iran besides this (Bushehr) agreement." Russia will complete two blocks of the plant already under construction and may bid for two more at the site, he says.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev states in an internet conference that Russia will not import spent nuclear fuel in the near future. He mentions that 80-85 percent of spent fuel is controlled by the United States, and for that Russia cannot participate without US consent. Mr. Rumyantsev says that Russia is currently negotiating with the United States but "the negotiations are difficult, because the US is criticizing us for cooperation with Iran....[W]hi le negations are being conducted with the US, no foreign [spent nuclear] fuel will be supplied to Russia in the next few years."
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev tells Vremya Novostei that the plant that Russia is building in Bushehr is identical to the one the US had promised to build in North Korea. He adds, "The IAEA last year carried out 60 inspections in Iran without finding a single case of abuse."
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov asserts that "the Russia-Iranian cooperation in nuclear power engineering has peaceful goals." He says that the "nuclear reactor to be finalized by Russian specialists in Iran cannot be used for war purposes since war plutonium is made by reactors of another type."
A Belarusian Foreign Ministry senior official refutes charges that Belarus may participate in nuclear deals with Iran. The senior official says, "The sales of nuclear arms components or technological cooperation in that area have never been mentioned." [Note: See similar statements in Late 1997 and 13 March 1998 and contradictory information in December 2001.]
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov meets with an Iranian delegation. Both sides agree that a plan for funding construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant should be concluded as soon as possible. A survey of the site by Russian experts will be finished in August or September. A Russian official says Russia and Iran will soon sign amendments to the January 1995 nuclear contract. The most significant amendment, says Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Lev Ryabev, is a provision for used nuclear fuel to be returned to Russia, where it will be processed at the Mayak plant in the Chelyabinsk region, and temporarily stored at the ore-dressing plant in Krasnoyarsk-26.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov rejects allegations of military nuclear cooperation with Iran and says that while there still exist some minor issues to be addressed, the first shipment of equipment necessary for the work in Bushehr has been sent out. He adds that safety is a foremost concern for Bushehr, but expresses satisfaction with the pace of work at the plant. He also states that the Iranian administrators of the power plant will begin their training while the work at Bushehr is being completed. He says that there will be some Russian personnel present at the plant acting as overseers, but that he is confident that there will be capable Iranian personnel to run the plant. In regard to continuing nuclear cooperation with Iran, he says that once the four reactors have been constructed, there might be a possibility for further cooperation.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov says Iran will pay the ministry $20 million this year for the work of Russian experts at the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov says that 1,000 Russian engineers will work at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran.
According to Israeli television, Turkish security authorities arrested members of a network involved in smuggling plutonium and osmium to be used in the production of nuclear weapons in Iran. Members of the network reportedly have been in contact with several key officials in Iran, possibly the Iranian defense minister.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov says that the US delegation that was in Moscow to discuss US-Russian economic cooperation did not raise the issue of Russian cooperation in building the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He says, "We shall cooperate with Iran. We built, are building, and will continue to build power plants [in Iran]."
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov says the United States is welcome to submit a proposal for control of nuclear activity at the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Adamov says construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is progressing and that 200 Russian specialists are working at the site.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Adamov says that Russia proposed building a research reactor in Iran. The contract was first drafted in 1996 and is now awaiting approval by both governments. Adamov says that the reactor would use enriched uranium of 20% or less and would meet IAEA requirements. Adamov also says that Russia was planning on "stepping up the pace of construction" at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Russian officials are considering finishing the project on a "turnkey" contract basis. This will allow Russia to raise the price of the reactor from $780 million to just over $1 billion.
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Adamov says that the United States has not provided any information to justify the sanctions imposed upon three Russian institutions accused of providing assistance to Iran's missile and nuclear programs. Adamov says Russia does not want neighboring states to acquire nuclear weapons. According to Adamov, "The Russian special service strictly control[s] enterprises and institutes with nuclear technologies." [Note: See 12, 13, 14 January 1999.]
Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Adamov signs a protocol with the head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Gholam Reza Aqazadeh to conduct a feasibility study regarding the Bushehr nuclear power project. According to Reuters, Iran wants the feasibility study to center on building three additional nuclear reactors at the Bushehr site. Russia is currently assisting Iran in the construction of a 1,000MW nuclear reactor, with a second reactor already under agreement. Adamov says that Iran's willingness to purchase more nuclear reactors proves that "the Iranian side believes the work will be completed." The additional reactors will reportedly cost between $3 billion to $4.5 billion.
Russian Atomic Energy Ministry Deputy Minister Viktor Mikhailov tells journalists that the Atomic Energy Ministry plans to export 50% of its atomic industry output by 2000. The Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran employs 1,100 Russian engineers and will take at least 10 years to finish. Mikhailov says that "Iran is a promising market for the sale of advanced Russian technologies."
Russian Atomic Energy Ministry spokesman Andrei Yedemsky says Russia will get a contract to build a second reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, a deal worth about $1 billion. [Note: See 14 January, 4 April and 22 May 2000.]
Russian Atomic Energy Ministry spokesman Georgy Kaurov complains of US "double standards" concerning the Russian proposal to furnish Iran with a nuclear reactor. He says that the dispute may turn into a contentious issue at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference in April 1995. Kaurov compares the $800 million Russian-Iranian deal with the US plan to supply North Korea with a light water reactor. He also claims that production of weapons-grade material from a light water reactor is not possible. US officials argue that no nuclear technology should be supplied to Iran on the grounds that it could aid Iran in becoming a "nuclear-armed terrorist state." According to a Western diplomat, Iran "has an extremely low level of technology. By giving them nuclear reactors, you are putting them a step up the ladder." Kaurov notes in response that many Iranian nuclear experts were trained in the United States.
Russian daily Izvestiya reports that Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov has recently said that Iran has agreed to a deal for the construction of three nuclear reactors in addition to the one under construction at Bushehr. One additional reactor would be built at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, and the other two at a location not yet specified. The deal would be worth $3.3 billion. [Note: See 14 January 2000.] About 1,000 Russians are working on the first reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. [Note: On 26 January 2000, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Adamov said 200 Russians were working at Bushehr.]
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev meets with Hasan Ruhani, chief of the Iranian Supreme Security Council. Sergeyev says, "Russia intends to maintain the dynamics of its bilateral ties with Iran in the military, military-technical, scientific technical, and energy fields."
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov says Russia will not limit its military or technical cooperation with Iran, including construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. "The construction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr meets all commitments that Russia has undertaken to the global community," he says. "I think I should mention that the United States is building a similar nuclear power plant in North Korea."
According to ITAR-TASS Russian News Agency, Japan's Sankei Shimbun newspaper alleges that North Korea shipped gas used in atomic fuel enrichment and production of war-grade uranium to Iran on 20 May, and that Iran signed an agreement for the delivery of gaseous fluorine because of a shortage at the Isfahan nuclear research center.
Russian Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov says that Moscow is determined to continue its cooperation with Tehran while viewing its economic interests as well as its obligations as for the nonproliferation principle. Mr. Ivanov tells reporters in Madrid that Russia is an independent decisionmaker in the sphere of military technical cooperation with countries such as North Korea and Iran. Furthermore, Mr. Ivanov states that Russia only exports to Iran the type of weapons that cannot have a destabilizing influence on the region; he says, "...the talk is about deliveries of defensive weapons air defense means, armored personnel carriers, anti tank and small weapons."
Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Reshetnikov says construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is planned to begin in November or December. [Note: He may be referring to the beginning of construction on two additional proposed reactors, not the original reactor. See 5 September 1995 entry for a similar statement by a Russian official.] Nearly 200 Russian scientists have been working on the reactor since January, and 3,000 additional workers are to be part of the contingency as well.
Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Reshetnikov says the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry will train Iranian nuclear experts in Russia. They will probably be trained at the Novovoronezh nuclear power plant, 42 kilometers from Voronezh, he says. The training of the Iranian experts will be to ensure the safe operation of the nuclear power plant to be constructed at Bushehr. He also says a delegation from the atomic energy ministry will go to Iran 26 October to submit a feasibility study of the equipment and site at Bushehr and to discuss problems with construction. He says Russian construction at Bushehr is expected to commence in November 1995.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert Chernyshev tells Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Vaezi that Russia will honor its commitments to Iran, including the deal for the Bushehr nuclear power station. Chernyshev says Russia opposes sanctions against Iran. The Russian official also says US President Bill Clinton is expected to raise US opposition to the Bushehr deal in a pending visit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, but that Russia intends "to remain as assertive as before."
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov urges Iran to sign a protocol placing all its nuclear facilities under IAEA control.
According to Levan Kidzinidze, former aid to Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze, four physicists are sent to Iran to help Iran develop nuclear weapons with Abashidze's assistance. [Note: On 26 February 2002, the Iranian embassy in Georgia issues a statement denying this; see 26 February 2002 entry.]
Russian Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov publishes an article in Yadernyy Kontrol. Mikhailov says that agreements with Iran are being developed along the lines of the Bushehr project. Mikhailov attributes the three-year delay in execution of the project to relocating the site from the seismically active northern region of the country, proposed earlier by the Iranians, to its present location in 1995. Additional time was lost because of Iran's insistence on carrying out the construction and maintenance work independently. After Iran made no tangible progress, Minatom took full charge of the construction in 1998; currently there are 600 Russian specialists working on the site. Mikhailov also explains that the Iranian offer for cooperation in uranium mining and enrichment was similar to Minatom's agreement with China, where Russia is building a gas centrifuge plant. Mikhailov asserts that despite criticism by Russian opposition political parties and the United States, Russia must continue its nuclear cooperation with Iran if it wants to retain its allies in the Persian Gulf region and in the Islamic world in general.
Russian Deputy Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Sidorenko says Russia will build several modernized VVER reactors in both Iran and China. Negotiations with Iran are in their final stage, he says. Although weapons-grade material could be produced from the spent fuel, he says Iran will promise to adhere to the internal safeguards agreement and will allow for international supervision.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Davydov says that the reactors that Russia is constructing at Bushehr are civilian light water reactors with ordinary output, which cannot produce plutonium.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets reassures Iranian Ambassador Mehdi Safari that the Bushehr nuclear power plant will be finished despite US concerns over the project. He also announces plans for further economic cooperation between Russian and Iran and stresses both countries need to enhance cooperation in the fields of metallurgy, petrochemicals, and military technology.
Russian diplomat states that Moscow demanded from a Washington firm a proof that Iran was developing nuclear weapons with Russia's help. A Russian official states "Our cooperation is focused on economic aspects that do not undermine the non-proliferation regime ... If the US side has any doubts about this, then we want to hear specific facts."
Russian experts start work on the first unit of Iran's 1000MW plant, according to a source at the plant. Iran signed an agreement with the Russian experts several months ago. The Bushehr nuclear power plant is scheduled to be finished in four years. According to the report, 85% of the construction and 65% of mechanical and electrical work at Bushehr is complete.
Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Igor Ivanov says that the United States should refrain from making unfounded allegations about Russia's peaceful nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and US Secretary of State Warren Christopher meet in Geneva to discuss US opposition to the pending Russian sale of two light water reactors (LWRs) to Iran. The only agreement reached during the meetings between two parties is a decision to meet again before Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton meet on 9 May 1995 in Moscow. US officials have admitted that the sale of Russian LWRs, worth between $800 million and $1 billion, would not directly assist the Iranians in building a nuclear bomb. The agreement would include the training of Iranian experts in Moscow. Russia has already sent 200 of its own experts to Iran. Iran will reportedly return spent fuel to Russia. The US has argued that the sale would be "counterproductive" to nonproliferation efforts and "could provide cover for Tehran to acquire other technology and materials useful in a weapons program." The US has pointed to a tightening of its trade embargo with Iran; including the cancellation of an agreement worth $1 billion between Iran and Conoco, as evidence of US willingness to accept economic loss.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev says that, with respect to nonproliferation, it would be safer for Iran to purchase a nuclear reactor from Russia than to seek nuclear technology from another source. Kozyrev reiterates that Russia will not assist Iran in manufacturing nuclear weapons, but will build the reactor for peaceful purposes. In a speech at the Johns Hopkins International Research Center, Kozyrev says, "I do not see any reasons why we should abandon the sale of reactors which is being conducted in compliance with international guarantees." It will take Russia 55 months to bring the reactor on line.
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov says that Russia is ready to resolve US concerns about the Russian Nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov says that Russia is not involved in Iranian nuclear missile projects. He adds that Russia is supplying Iran with the same light water reactors as the U.S. is supplying North Korea.
According to Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy (Moscow), the Russian commission on military industry, chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, decides that Russia will build three reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, not just the original one. ITAR-TASS, however, reports that a possible deal was announced by Vice Prime Minister Klebanov after his meeting with Iranian Supreme Security Council chief Hassan Ruhani, but does not indicate that a final decision has been made.
Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alexander Yakovenko confirms Russia's determination to continue its nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko says of Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran, "We declare once again that the cooperation is solely peaceful and not against the interest of any third country."
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexandr Yakovenko has declared that the Russian-Iranian protocol is nearly drafted and will soon be signed. The agreement requires Iran to return any spent nuclear fuel to Russia.
Russian government sources say the replacement of Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeniy Adamov with Aleksandr Rumyantsev will not mean an end to Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Russian head of Atomic Energy Agency (Rosatom), Aleksandr Rumyantsev states Russia is very likely to start supplying nuclear fuel to Iran's Bushehr power plant in 2005. The two countries are scheduled to sign an agreement in January. Meanwhile, Tehran has promised new contracts for Russia, including seven generating units worth $10 billion.
Russian intelligence sources say Iranian scientists being trained at the NIKIET Institute in Russia are acquiring knowledge that can used for Iran's nuclear weapons program. "They are here unofficially and have been told to keep as low a profile as possible," says the Russian intelligence source. "They are being taught and are gaining experience they cannot get at home. It is hardly a secret that the Iranians are in a race to develop nuclear weapons."
Russian machine-building company Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg begins production of equipment for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The company received its first advanced payment in late December 1998, an undisclosed amount, and will build the reactor vessel, the steam generator casing, the "lid for the No. 1 unit," and "inner appliances." Production is expected to take three years.
Russian Minister for Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov justifies Russia's agreement to supply a light water reactor to Iran by noting that it is the same kind of reactor that the United States will supply to North Korea with the help of an international consortium. Mikhailov adds that cancellation of the Russian deal might cause Iran to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, at which point the United States would move to build nuclear facilities in Iran [to persuade it to remain a party to the Treaty, as it did with North Korea].
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov and Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, sign an $800 million contract that commits Russia to complete one of two nuclear reactors in Bushehr within four years. The contract formalizes a 1993 Russian agreement in principle to complete the facility. The contract calls for Russia to build a VVER-1,000MWe reactor at the site. German firm Siemens-Kraftwerke Union, began construction of the Bushehr plant in 1974, but failed to complete the project before the 1979 Islamic revolution. [Note: See November 1974 and March 1979 entries.] Germany has since prohibited the export of equipment vital to the project's completion. The bilateral meetings also included discussion of the construction of another 1000MW unit and two 440MW reactors at Bushehr, education of Iranian students and postgraduates at Russian institutes, and training for Iranian experts in the operation of nuclear power facilities in Russia. [Note: Some sources put the value of the deal at $1 billion rather than $800 million.]
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov says Russia will ship equipment in April for construction on the Bushehr nuclear power plant pursuant to a deal signed last year between the two states. He also announces that the number of Russian experts at Bushehr will increase from 20 to 500. He estimates the project will take 2.5 years to complete. In accordance with this deal, Russia will also provide Iran with nuclear fuel and help train its engineers and technicians.
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeney Adamov says US efforts to persuade Iran not cooperate in the nuclear field with Iran "should be viewed as a desire to deprive Russian factories of orders."
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov admitted that installation of a VVER-1000 [1000MW light water] reactor at Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant is running 18 months behind schedule. Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Reshetnikov said that large-scale physical work at Bushehr has only just begun. A great deal of preliminary engineering and design work was needed in order to determine what use could be made of the existing German installations and components left over when German firms withdrew from the construction project in 1979. Much of the equipment on site is obsolete and will have to be replaced. Out of 80,000 items of German equipment available at Bushehr, about 47,000 are likely to be useable. About 11,000 items of electrical and mechanical equipment are ready for use but lack the required quality assurance documentation. The plant is now scheduled for commissioning in March 2002, but Minatom officials hope that the reactor will be commissioned four or five months before this.
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov insists that Russia would go ahead with its project to build a nuclear reactor in Iran, and says the project is for peaceful purposes and would earn more money for Russia's nuclear industry than aid programs could provide. Adamov says that the reactor project is purely a business deal that was carried out with consideration for the political sensitivities involved, criticizing the United States for its "biased and politicized" objections to the project. Adamov also says that he took Russian nuclear specialists to Iran in November 1998 to discuss training for Iranian nuclear scientists. Russia was ready to provide extensive training, Adamov says, but he did not give further details, which he said were still being finalized. PIR Center Director Vladimir Orlov says that the Russian government was lax in preventing the export of weapons technology.
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov meets with Jessica Matthews, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, to accept an invitation for an international conference on nonproliferation in Washington, DC in March 2000 and to discuss some issues of management of nuclear materials, including Russia's cooperation with Iran. Adamov pointed out that no one in the United States can explain how the Bushehr nuclear plant will increase Iran's military nuclear potential, and that the United States is building a similar nuclear plant in North Korea. Adamov emphasized that Russia and the United States have not worked out an agreement on preventing excessive accumulation of separated plutonium, and no negotiations on the subject are being held. After the meeting with Matthews, he stated that Russia does not intend to stop exporting nuclear reactors to Iran and other countries, even if the US Congress approves a proposal to allocate an additional $100,000 [sic] for work on nonproliferation and nuclear security.
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov says during an appearance on Iranian television that Iranian authorities plan to accept Russia's proposal for cooperation on construction of three new nuclear reactors in Iran. According to Adamov, Russian experts are about to finish their work on the Bushehr plant, but may continue their activities in the next few months. Iranian authorities emphasized the peaceful character of the country's nuclear program. IAEA Press Secretary David Kyd recently gave a similar statement.
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov says that Iran has officially offered to expand its cooperation with Russia on the peaceful use of nuclear energy and explore the possibility of building a second unit at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Adamov says that both sides should carefully study the feasibility of constructing a second reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He adds that Russia has not yet decided on this offer, and it is preparing a reply to the Iranian proposal. Adamov does not rule out the possibility of Iran awarding the contract to another country after it examines Russia's reply. Russia is continuing the work on the first block, which "is going actively enough, strictly in line with the contract," Adamov says.
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov says that Russia is determined to continue construction of the nuclear power plant in Iran, for which Russia could earn up to $1 billion per reactor. He denies reports in Western media stating that Russia would end its cooperation with Iran in exchange for $100 million from the United States.
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov states that Iran intends to contract with Russia for the construction of three additional reactors for the nuclear power plant at Bushehr.
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov visits Iran. Iran asks Russia "to prepare a feasibility study for adding three more nuclear reactors at Bushehr." Adamov estimates that the reactors would cost between $3 billion and $4.5 billion.
Russian Minister of Atomic Power Viktor Mikhailov states at a news conference that nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran is for peaceful purposes only and has no military aspect. He also emphasizes that Russia has sacrificed financial gain in the past by supporting Western plans to sanction another country's nuclear program, and would not make a similar mistake again. Mikhailov specifically mentions the 1995 nuclear deal with North Korea, which Russia halted to support US sanctions against Pyongyang. However, when it became clear that North Korea was unable to develop nuclear weapons, the United States offered to build a nuclear station. This outcome, Mikhailov says, cost Russia millions of dollars. Also, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov notes that Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran is "under IAEA's guarantees and controls," and is not out of line with its international obligations.
Russian Minister of Nuclear Energy Alexander Rumyanstev says Russia is ready to begin preliminary discussions on building the second phase of the Bushehr power plant in Iran. They are now at a completion rate of 80-85 percent and expect the billion dollar reactor to become operational in the first months of 2005.
Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy spokesman Georgiy Kaurov says Russia will supply Iran with equipment for Bushehr in April 1996 or May 1996.
According to reports from Moscow, Russia will shortly deliver the first 40 tons of nuclear fuel rods for Bushehr. It is also reported that the Russian Atomstoiexport has signed a contract with TWEL, one of the world's largest suppliers of fuel rods to acquire fuel rods for Bushehr.
Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev rejects US concerns that Russia was supplying Iran with military nuclear technology; he states, "Russia is not supplying Iran with any technology related to nuclear weapons and is not carrying out negotiations in this field."
Russian nuclear experts say it would be easier in some ways to build a new nuclear power plant at Bushehr than to finish the one left partially built by a German contractor. Russian experts inspecting the site say the main problem is the lack of documentation on the site, as the German contractor did not leave it all with Iran. As many as 220 Russian experts have been inspecting the site and collecting data for further design. This stage of work should be finished in June, says one Russian working at the site, after which about 50 to 60 Russian experts will remain at the site. Another problem, Russian experts say, is the plant's 1970s design does not meet current safety standards.
Russian official states that Russia will supply Bushehr with nuclear fuel even if Iran does not sign the IAEA's additional protocol.
Russian officials and representatives of the Russian TVEL fuel company are negotiating with Iranians officials regarding the return of Russian spent nuclear fuel from the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Russian officials express displeasure at the US sanctions aimed against three Russian institutes for allegedly aiding Iran's missile and nuclear weapons programs. "Strong-arm measures or sanctions against our organizations are counterproductive for Russian-American relations," says Russian Prime Minister Yevgeniy Primakov. Pavel D. Sarkisov, rector of Mendeleyev University, one of the three penalized institutes, says the school's graduates are not trained in handling weapons-grade nuclear material or making nuclear weapons. "My theory of how our institute has ended up on the blacklist is that probably some of our former students were hired on an individual basis by someone commissioned by Iran to create its nuclear defense complex," Sarkisov says. "We could have helped Iran if we wanted to, but we never did." [Note: See 12 and 13 January 1999.]
Russian officials of the foreign ministry and Atomic Energy Ministry visit Washington to lessen the worries of the American administration with respect to the Russian-Iranian cooperation. They will also offer a new plan for cooperation with the United States regarding the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation.
Russian officials say that discussions with Iran for the supply of additional reactors [to the one it agreed to build at Bushehr in January 1995] includes research reactors to be located at Iranian universities. Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy spokesman Georgi Kaurov says the total value of the contracts could reach $3 billion, although Western diplomats in Moscow have estimated that the value could be as high as $8 billion. Another report indicates that Russia will also assist Iran in the maintenance of its operating research reactors, and that 3,000 Russians will arrive at Bushehr in the near future to work on the construction of the nuclear power plant. A Minatom statement on 20 February says Russia is looking into the supply of desalination facilities to Bushehr and light water research reactors to universities in Iran. The head of the Russian Security Council's ecological safety committee, Alexei Yablokov says that the reactor deal involves a Russian commitment to recycle the spent fuel from the Bushehr reactor and "return plutonium" to Iran.
Russian officials say that they will not discuss the bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement with Iran during a nuclear safety summit that they will be hosting. Georgy Kaurov, a spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry, says that the reactors under construction pose no threat of nuclear proliferation, and the agreement between Iran and Russia is irrelevant and will not be under discussion.
Russian officials were sending mixed signals on the question of whether Russia will provide the Iranians with gas centrifuges. Lev Ryabev, the First Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy, denies that Russia will provide centrifuges to Iran. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin says, "Moscow will not risk any steps which could facilitate the development of technology for the production of nuclear weapons by Tehran," but added that the question of selling the centrifuges was a "separate issue."
According to reports, Iranian President Rafsanjani and the deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran travel to Yazd to evaluate work on a major Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps nuclear research center.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin reassures US President Bill Clinton during a phone conversation that Russia is unaware of any Russian assistance to Iran's nuclear capabilities.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin says there was nothing "further from the truth" than reports that Russia has supplied ballistic missile and nuclear technologies to Iran. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, meeting with US Vice President Al Gore, expresses concern over the possibility that Iran was developing nuclear weapons, but denies that Russia was involved in transferring nuclear technology.
Russian President Putin's spokesman, Sergey Yastrzhembskiy, reasserts that Russia will neither provide Iran with ballistic missile technology nor participate in Iranian missile programs. American intelligence believes that Iran could be capable of deploying missiles with nuclear or chemical warheads within two to three years. The US government warns that any technological assistance from Russia to Iran will be met with sanctions, possibly undermining the stability of US-Russia relations. Yastrzhembskiy assures the United States that any past wrong-doing was instigated by "individual irresponsible firms," and that "there is no longer any cause for concern."
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Mohammed Khatami sign a series of nuclear and military accords. Khatami says that Iran plans to order a second nuclear power plant after the completion of the first one in Bushehr.
Russian President Vladimir Putin defends a missile deal with Syria and nuclear components sales to Iran in talks with Israeli President Moshe Katsav. Regarding Iran, Putin stresses "we are working to make sure their nuclear ability is used for peaceful means." The president also said "I agree...the Iranian partners should drop the idea of creating a nuclear cycle, and put all their nuclear programs under international control" and stressed that Russia "is resolutely against any attempts on the part of Iran to acquire nuclear weapons."
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instituted changes to the 1992 presidential decree "On Controlling the Export of Nuclear Materials, Equipment and Technologies from the Russian Federation" that permit Russia to supply nuclear technologies and materials to countries whose nuclear programs are not fully monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This is reportedly Moscow's response to the US Congress's passage of the Iran Nonproliferation Act, which imposes sanctions against Russian companies suspected of supplying Iran with prohibited technologies and materials. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Atomic Energy stated that Russia's ability to export nuclear materials and technologies has been "broadened considerably." It is believed that Putin revised his predecessor's decree in order to expedite the implementation of a contract with Teheran in the near future. Russia is currently building two reactors for the Iranian nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The contract won by the Atomic Energy Ministry is worth about $800 million. In addition, Moscow and Tehran are holding talks on the construction of three more nuclear facilities in Iran, valued at $2 billion. Iran already operates two nuclear reactors at the Bushehr plant that are potentially capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium. These plants are monitored by the IAEA. Several other plants, however, are not being monitored. This is the reason the United States asserted that Russia's assistance is helping Iran acquire a nuclear weapon capability.
Russian President Vladimir Putin says he talked with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami about delays in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, and says they "came to the conclusion that they are technical in nature, stemming from sluggishness of the partners, which we will correct."
Russian President Vladimir Putin says, "We have not ever sold anything to Iran out of the range of technology or information that would help Iran develop missiles or weapons of mass destruction." As for Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran, he says "it has nothing to do with developing nuclear weapons. We are categorically opposed to transferring any technologies to Iran that would help it develop nuclear weapons."
Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepashin declares that it is not in Russia's interests for other countries, including Iran, to acquire nuclear weapons. Stepashin adds that Russia is prepared to look into specific instances, if any, of Russian nuclear technology and weapons proliferation. Stepashin's declaration is made following a meeting with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Moscow. According to Stepashin, Barak expressed concern over the proliferation of missile technology to Iran and the absence of a control mechanism in Iraq. Barak speaks to Russian journalists after the talks with President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Sergey Stepashin, and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. He says that Russia denied allegations of nuclear technology proliferation and requested more information on this subject.
According to Reuters, Russian President Vladimir Putin claims he has proof that Western firms are "working in Iran's atomic technology sector, including dual-use technology."
Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepashin signs a directive permitting the Russian government to prepare for negotiations with Iran to build three new units at the Bushehr nuclear power station. If the negotiations are successful, Russia will earn $2 billion, according to preliminary calculations. Discussions on this topic will take place during the visit of Iranian Interior Minister Abdul Wahid Musavi-Lari to Russia 29 June-1 July 1999. In May 1999, Iran put forward a proposal to Russia for building an additional unit at the Bushehr nuclear power station. According to Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy Vladimir Vinogradov, Russia won the Bushehr contract despite competition from several European Union countries, and, apart from political considerations, Iran selected the Russian bid because Russian nuclear technology is cheaper than European technology. Russia refutes US allegations that Iran has a secret nuclear weapons program and explains that the Bushehr contract stipulates the construction of VVER-1000 [1000MW light-water] nuclear reactors, which cannot produce sufficient plutonium for fabricating nuclear weapons. Moreover, the spent fuel would be returned to Russia. At present, Russia is building one VVER-1000 light water reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. This contract is worth more than $800 million. Russian nuclear specialists expect to fulfill $150 million of the Iranian contract in the current year. According to Minatom, the first unit is 30 to 40% complete.
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and US Vice President Al Gore announce that they discussed in detail today the issue of Russia's nuclear deal with Iran. Chernomyrdin says many issues need to be discussed further and that Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran will not lead to Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Gore says the United States will give Russia confidential information that shows why the United States is concerned with the deal.
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin decrees a prohibition on the transfer of material or information not listed in Russia's export control documents to any country suspected of procuring the information in order to develop nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons and their affiliated delivery systems. US Vice President Al Gore expresses his concern, noting that Russian companies are rumored to have agreements with Iran that could aid it in producing weapons of mass destruction.
Russian radio reports that Iran and Russia are facing serious financial differences relevant to the construction of Bushehr nuclear power plant. The Russian Mignews Internet Agency quotes Russian diplomatic sources who say that Iran has not met its payment commitments.
According to Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Iran and the Russian Federation sign a 15-year bilateral nuclear agreement in Tehran, which covers increased cooperation in nuclear safety; radioisotope production and use in the fields of medicine, agriculture, and industry; construction and operation of nuclear power plants; research and development; and training. Amrollahi says this general agreement calls for the construction of two Russian VVER-440-213 (water-cooled and moderated) type pressurized water reactors in Iran. [Note: Amrollahi reveals the agreement at the International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference in September 1992. See 23 September 1992 entry. ITAR-TASS reports on 7 September that Minatom Information Department head Georgiy Kaurov says the document will be signed on 21 September at the beginning of the General Conference and will include cooperation on the industrial production of nuclear reactor and fuel cycle components and materials. IAEA sources on 15 September report the two countries have reached agreement on the basic (terms) for cooperation and will sign the pact "soon."]
Russian shipments of enriched uranium for the Bushehr plant may be delayed until autumn. A source in the Russian nuclear authority said "the latest delay did not have any underlying political reasons." The fuel is required six months prior to startup which is tentatively scheduled to start operating in 2006.
Russian television reports that Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg will get $50 million for its work on equipment for the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Russian television reports that Russian intelligence has told the CIA that two nuclear warheads from Semipalatisk, Khazakhstan, were sold to Iran and another unknown Middle East country with the permission of Kazakhstani President Nazarbayev. The warheads are of a capacity ranging from 2 to 5 kilotons. [Note: See 27 May 1992 entry for NATO statement rebutting this report.]
Russia's Ambassador to Iran states that Washington has not produced any concrete proof supporting the accusations that Iran is developing nuclear weapons.
Russia's ambassador to Iran, Kostantin Shuvalov, visits the Bushehr nuclear power plant to inspect certain sections of the plant as well as the progress of the Russian specialists working on the plant. Shuvalov says that a completion date for the reactor would be announced at an upcoming meeting in Russia by the head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh. Russian Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeni Adamov says on 13 April 1998 that he "will try to persuade President Boris Yeltsin to authorize the sale of an experimental nuclear reactor to Iran." [Note: See 6 April 1998.] Adamov says that the "experimental installation" would be a research reactor using a uranium grade of less than 20 percent.
Russia's ambassador to Iran, Sergei Tretyakov, says Russia could further assist Iran in building more nuclear power stations after it concludes work on the Bushehr nuclear facility in southern Iran.
Russia's ambassador to Iran, Sergey Tretyakov, says Russia will continue to cooperate with Iran in the nuclear field despite US pressure. He says, "Moscow will not accept any advice from the United States about its relations with other countries; in particular with the Islamic Republic of Iran."
Russia's atomic energy minister announces that in November 2001 it plans to deliver the first of two nuclear reactors for a 1000MW power station. Russian technicians at Bushehr will be mostly responsible for building the station. This announcement is the result of over a year of discussions.
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister (and Foreign Economic Relations Minister) Oleg Davydov says the Russian-Iranian nuclear power cooperation is without complications and restrictions. Davydov adds that the cooperation between the two countries is continuing pursuant to contracts already signed.
Russia's First Atomic Energy Minister Lev Ryabev mentions that the Atomic Energy Ministry is drawing up documents to be signed with Iran regarding the return of spent Russian nuclear fuel from the Bushehr nuclear power plant to Russia. He also adds that this control will prevent the possibility "of spent fuel being used for any other purposes." With regard to general Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation on Bushehr, Mr. Ryabev states, "We plan to start putting it in operation in 2003 or in 2004....As for plans for further programs, no concrete agreements have been reached. Moreover, no contracts have been signed....I would not like to say that will build only one reactor. But I also would not like to say that we will certainly build six or any other number of reactors, since any such statements would be premature." Mr. Ryabev mentions that, "The most realistic follow up of the cooperation would be to complete the second power generating unit of the Bushehr plant. But, so far, there are no corresponding agreements or documents." The First Atomic Energy Minister once again stresses that "there is no military cooperation between Russia and Iran in the nuclear area." He recalls that during a meeting with US officials in April, he proposed setting up a joint US-Russian expert group that would look into Russia's cooperation with Iran and what the US views as a matter of concern. Mr. Ryabev says, "Unfortunately, no such steps have been taken. There is only criticism, and when you ask for documents to prove this concern, no such documents are made available. Only an emotional call to stop this cooperation follows."
Russia's foreign ministry announces that the delivery of nuclear fuel to Iran is predicated on Iran signing a bilateral agreement to return spent nuclear fuel to Russia.
Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy, Viktor Mikhailov, says Russia will consider at the 29-30 June meeting of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission a US recommendation that nuclear fuel supplied for the Bushehr nuclear power plant be no more than 20% enriched uranium. [See 11 May 1995 for more information on the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission.] He also says there are plans for Russia to conduct inspections anytime at the plant. He denies that Russia plans to build a plant for extracting uranium, but confirms that Iran asked for this, as recorded in the protocol of the talks in January 1995. [Note: This may contradict a statement by Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, on 11 May 1995 that Iran did not seek a gas centrifuge.] Mikhailov also says Iran has asked Russia to sell it 2,000 tons of natural uranium, but the two sides could not agree on a price. [Note: See 2 June 1995.]
Russia's nuclear power minister says Russia and Iran moved closer to an agreement "on the return of spent nuclear fuel" from the Bushehr reactor that Russia is building Iran. The only obstacle is said to be a technical argument pertaining to environmental protection.
Russia's Rosatom indicates it will supply about 80 tons of low-enriched uranium fuel to the Iranian nuclear power plant at Bushehr as soon as it is "technologically necessary."
Russia's State Duma ratifies a cooperation treaty with Iran. Alexander Losyukov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, says, "The key areas of our cooperation will be in the military-technological sphere and the peaceful use of the nuclear atom." He says construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is a "symbol of the new stage of cooperation."
Sabah Al-Khayr of Cairo reports that according to secret documents allegedly smuggled out of Iran and obtained by the United States, Iran has secretly obtained nuclear material that could be used for a nuclear weapon. The documents allege that Iran imported the material through a nearby country with the cover story that the uranium would be used for medical purposes. Instead, however, it was intended to be "chemically processed" for use in a nuclear weapon, according to the secret documents. The documents also allege that Iran has secretly cooperated with Pakistan on nuclear issues. [Note: According to Sabah Al-Khayr, the documents were reportedly smuggled out of Iran by six defecting Iranian intelligence officials; reportedly including intelligence Chief Ali Fallahian. See July 1995 entry on the reported defection of Fallahian. Fallahian ran against President Khatami for the presidency of Iran in 2001 and as of 9 August 2002 was still in Iran.]
Sakartvelos Respublika (Tbilisi) reports that in a treaty of friendship and cooperation signed by Iran and Georgia, both nations agree that they share a similar view in support of disarmament, controls on weapons of mass destruction, and their reduction and eventual elimination. The treaty also states that both nations wish to declare the Persian Gulf and the Black Sea both a zone of peace and a nuclear and chemical weapon-free zone.
Salzburger Nachrichten reports that IDPC, the Vienna-based company that bought parts from the recently decommissioned Zwentendorf nuclear power plant in Vienna, must apply for individual export permits on a case-by-case basis. This comes as a result of allegations that the parts could be sold to Iran. Siemens, which began the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran, says the technologies are not interchangeable, one reactor being a pressure water type and the other a boiling water reactor. [Note: See also 3, 7, and 11 November 1997.]
Sean Rowan, spokesman for the Canadian foreign ministry, says Canada has put an experimental fusion reactor on its export control list, effectively barring its potential sale to Iran. [Note: See 14 July 1999.]
Secretary General of the OIC Abdelouahed Belkeziz welcomes Iran's cooperation with the IAEA and its decision to sign an additional protocol to the NPT.

Segodnya of Moscow reports that the US State Department essentially admitted its tactics to deter Russia from allowing the transfer of military and dual-purpose technologies to Iran will change to focus on individual firms. The reports asserts, "These firms will now face a 'red light': On plausible pretexts (not because of ties with Tehran) they will be refused grants and technical assistance." These firms are on a list, which Segodnya alleges, was made by the US government that includes some 20 Russian companies accused of transferring dual-purpose technologies to Iran.
Seimens of Germany formally notifies Iran that the Bushehr deal was cancelled indefinitely.
Senior Iranian cleric Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati says although Iran has accepted to sign the additional protocol, "...Our 'red lines' still exist." He further says, "If the European party fails to live up to its commitments, the commitments that we made should be in return regarded as canceled."
Senior US officials say China has agreed not to continue nuclear assistance or sales of anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran. Chinese Foreign Minister Quian Qichen reportedly made the pledge in a meeting with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. An agreement on this issue could lead to the end of a US embargo on sales of civilian nuclear technology to China.
Sergei Baburin, the vice-speaker of the Russian State Duma, on a visit to Iran says that the two countries can cooperate in several fields including nuclear energy.
Sergei Ivanov, Russian Defense Minister, rejects accusations that Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran has allegedly violated the system of control over weapons of mass destruction. He tells journalists that Russia's cooperation with Iran is purely commercial and did not allow any breaches of the nonproliferation system. Mr. Ivanov also says that these allegations are a "myth which, unfortunately, is widespread in the world." He adds "this myth is encouraged by a few countries and spread by Western media." With regard to the Bushehr nuclear plant construction, Mr. Ivanov stated, "The construction is fully controlled by the IAEA. For this reason, when Russia is accused of violating the regime of nonproliferation with this project, we can only be indignant."
Sergey Karaganov, president of the Foreign and Defense Policy Council, says nuclear tests conducted by Iran and Pakistan are unlikely to produce a "domino-effect" of weapons production in other countries. Karaganov asserts it will take Iran ten years to produce a bomb.
Sergey Tertyakev, the Russian Ambassador to Iran, says that Russia is dedicated to all its commitments to Iran, stressing its determination to complete the Bushehr power plant. He adds that he foresees no setbacks as financial matters have been resolved.
Sergey Tetrayakov, the Russian ambassador to Iran, says that the feasibility study of the Bushehr project was recently completed and construction is expected to start soon. He expresses optimism for the completion of the project in 48 months. He re-emphasizes that Russia's assistance with the Bushehr power plant is for peaceful purposes and is monitored by international inspectors.
Sergey Tretyakov, Russia's ambassador to Iran, says that Russia's assistance in building the Bushehr nuclear power plant is completely legal. He says that the pursuit of nuclear technology for peaceful uses is "the right of every country."
Sergey Yastrzhembskiy, spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin, says Russia will finish building the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran, which he states is under the strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He further states that no country should be prevented access to nuclear power, and that any allegations by "feverish minds in some US and Israeli media organizations" that Russia is providing missile technology to Iran are false.
Several Russian officials deny Russia's alleged illicit cooperation with Iran on nuclear missile technologies. The officials included Speaker of the Russian Duma Gennadiy Seleznev, a spokesman for Russian General and Vocational Education Minister Vladimir Filippov, Rector of the D.I. Mendeleyev Russian Chemical-Technological University Pavel Sarkisov, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Rector of Moscow Aviation Institute Aleksandr Matviyenko, and Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
Shamim Chaudhury, head of the IAEA's technical cooperation department for the Middle East and Western Asia, inspects the Bushehr nuclear plant in southern Iran to check for compliance with international regulations for the exploitation of nuclear energy and safety standard. Iran has expanded its coordination with the IAEA in recent years by opening the plant for inspections and handing over documents related to the plants design and safety. Hamid Reza Asefi, an Iranian Forging Ministry official states that the Iran intends to complete the construction of the Bushehr plant; he says "We don't pay attention to threats and are determined to finish the works on the Bushehr station."
Sharg of Baku reports Iran is dumping nuclear waste on Azerbaijani territory occupied by Armenian forces. Due to the absence of reliable detection equipment at border checkpoints, there is no "control over the import of radioactive elements," according to Azerbaijani specialists. The Azerbaijani government has not confronted Iran about the alleged dumping because of the difficulty of entering Armenian-occupied territories to obtain definitive proof. Director of Azerbaijan's Izotop Association Agababa Huseynov raised the issue at an International Atomic Energy Agency seminar in Vienna, "The Role of Export Controls in Nuclear Nonproliferation." Huseynov cites "a number" of examples proving the presence of radioactive materials on Azerbaijani territory, particularly in locations where former Soviet armed forces personnel are stationed. Azerbaijan is not a member of the IAEA. [Note: See also 11 June 1999.]
According to Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov, Moscow is considering training Iranian nuclear scientists in Russia to work at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. However, no formal contract has been signed. Mikhailov says, "No such contract has been signed, but it will be."

Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, asks the Swiss authorities to regulate its exports of materials and equipment that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. The Swiss deny that its regulations pertaining to the export of such equipment are lax. [Note: See 25, 28 June 1993.]
Shimon Peres, Israel's prime minister, receives assurances from Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan that his country is looking to reduce Iran's influence in the region. Because of its voluntary forfeiture of nuclear weapons, Kazakhstan is reticent of any neighboring country's attempts to procure weapons of mass destruction.
According to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko, international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency have confirmed that Iran's nuclear program is purely civilian. Yakovenko stated that Russia believes "Iran has a right to develop nuclear programs of a non-military nature, in line with international treaties and agreements." Since the United States has blacklisted 10 Russian research centers and companies alleged to be cooperating with Iran on missile and nuclear research, the Russian Ministry of Education has stated that it would prevent Iranian students from participating in a Baltic University research project. Alexander Kondakov, the Russian minister of education, has agreed that Iranian students may have had access to Russian nuclear rocket technology through their studies.
Siemens challenges allegations that it is considering a plan to have a subsidiary of the Czech firm Skoda complete a reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Intelligence sources say that Siemens has a share in the subsidiary. Siemens spokesman Wolfgang Breyer denies that his company is "involved in any activities whatsoever which would enable third parties to complete the Bushehr plant."
Sirus Naseri, a senior Iranian delegation member to the IAEA, says ElBaradei's proposal for a five-year moratorium on the creation of new nuclear fuel production facilities worldwide means that already established nuclear fuel suppliers would essentially be handed a monopoly. Supreme National Security Council spokesman Ali Agha Mohammadi says, "We have the power to negotiate because we keep our [nuclear] achievements in our hands, and we are negotiating to protect them. It's definite that we will protect our scientific achievements as a basic pillar."
Sirus Nasseri, head of Iran's negotiating team, was upbeat about the latest round of negotiations with the Europeans that ended today, saying they "are on the right track, leading to a wise, logical and balanced solution satisfactory to both sides."
Sirus Nasseri, top nuclear negotiator for Iran in nuclear deliberations with the Europeans, has asserted "Ultimately, it seems that both sides intend to try and reach a solution" but that it is still too early to predict the outcome.
Skoda Plzen management states that while the Czech company is increasing commercial cooperation with Iran, "it ruled out the possibility that Skoda would like to conduct business in Iranian weapons and nuclear technology."
SNSC Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Hussein Musavian insists on Iran's legal right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes as guaranteed in the Paris Agreement and in cooperation with international organizations, while emphasizing that Iran has no intention of pursuing nuclear weapons. Musavian characterized his recent talks with the Russian foreign minister as "very constructive and useful," adding "Russia is Iran's most important partner in the field of nuclear technology."
SNSC head Hassan Rohani seeks IAEA closure of the Iran file, restating Iran's "inalienable right" to a nuclear program and asking for recognition of that program's peaceful intent.
According to Russia's Interfax news agency, Ali Akbar Soltan, deputy director-general of Iran's Foreign Ministry, says that Iran has the capacity to produce nuclear weapons but has no intention of doing so.
SNSC Secretary General Rohani expresses confidence that the IAEA would provide "a fair and exact report for the June meeting of the board of governors" in view of what he portrays as Iran's full cooperation on the nuclear issue. Iran would like to be dropped from the IAEA agenda after that meeting.
SNSC Secretary General Rohani, speaking on state television, rules out negotiations with the United States regarding its nuclear program, noting that Iran held talks with Germany, France, and Great Britain at their initiative only and declaring furthermore that the IAEA represented the only viable negotiating party on this issue.
SNSC Secretary Rohani appeals to Europe to help make the Middle East a WMD-free zone, pointing especially to the danger posed by Israel's WMD arsenal. Rohani assesses his meetings with the EU's Frattini and Solana as 'excellent' and declares again Iran's commitment to the agreement reached with the EU in Tehran.
South Africa reships furnace equipment to Iran supplied to it by Germany in the early 1980s.
South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo announces South Africa has concluded a bilateral agreement with Iran to establish nuclear technology assistance "for peaceful purposes." Nzo says South Africa's cooperation with Iran is "within the scope" of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Israeli Foreign Ministry Deputy Director General Zvi Mazael says he will inform Nzo that the South African agreement constitutes a violation of the US embargo on Iran.
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo denies reports that his country is giving nuclear secrets to Iran, but that the cooperation is within the scope of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. "What was at stake was isotopes for peaceful purposes," he says. The two countries concluded a nuclear technology deal involving isotopes for the use of peaceful purposes. [Note: See March, 19 August, and 20 August 1995 entries for more on Iran-South African nuclear cooperation.]
According to Russia's Ministers of Defense and Atomic Energy, Russia is disturbed by media reports that Western companies have been involved in shipping weapons of mass destruction technology to Iran. This came after media reports of the discovery of a centrifuge complex in Iran that could be used to enrich uranium which was produced with the aid of the British-Dutch URENCO Company.
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo states that South Africa "has not entered into any agreement concerning nuclear cooperation with Iran." The Israeli newspaper Maariv reports that a "high-ranking South African source" said South African nuclear assistance to Iran would not be of "military use."
South African Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha says that March 1995 talks with Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, had covered a previously discarded scheme for South Africa to sell enriched uranium to Iran. [Note: See March 1995 entry.]
South Africa's Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha denies the existence of a nuclear cooperation agreement with Iran.

Soviet scientists are offered up to $20,000 per month to work on Iran's nuclear program and are reported to be in Iran as of February 1992. Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, however, rejects speculations that his country has been trying to hire the scientists. One report claims that Iran has hired more than 50 former Soviet nuclear scientists. Alireza Jafarzadeh of the Mojahedin says "dozens" of nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union are already at five Iranian nuclear facilities: Gorgan, Moallem [Kalayeh], Isfahan, Karaj, and Darkhovin.
According to the Associated Press, Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's representative to the IAEA, claims Iran will "scale back its cooperation" with the IAEA in response to the October deadline. Iran claims its nuclear programs are meant to generate electricity and any contaminated equipment found was due to previous ownership before its import.
Spain and Iran negotiate a comprehensive economic deal worth $1.5 billion that provides room for cooperation in the field of nuclear technology. Nuclear cooperation between the two countries would be in the form of Spanish technical monitoring of the construction and the introduction of Western technologies at the Bushehr nuclear facility.
Speaking after five hours of discussion with Iranian officials, IAEA head ElBaradei refers to "welcome and positive steps" designed to put an end to concerns regarding Iran's nuclear activities. Iran has agreed to schedule UN inspections; its head for atomic energy Gholamreza Aqazadeh has pledged to accelerate Iran's cooperation.
Speaking at a news conference following the Russian-American Summit, US President Bill Clinton says that Russia's delivery of nuclear reactors to Iran would not harm US-Russian relations. He adds that the outcome of the talks with Russia outweigh a difference of opinion in regards to the cooperation between Iran and Russia. [Note: See 21 April 1996.]
Speaking at an international conference on the safety of Russia's power stations, Bulat Nigmatulin, the Russian Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy, says that Russia might sign new agreements to construct VVER-1000 [1000MW] nuclear power reactors in several countries, including Iran. Currently, Russia is building one VVER-1000 light water reactor in Iran. The cost to construct a VVER-1000 light water reactor is $1.5 to $2 billion. Nigmatulin states that Russian power stations "are equipped with highly safe reactors." He also announces that preliminary talks have begun with Iran [presumably on an additional reactor].
Speaking at weekly prayers in Tehran, former President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says, "The use of an atomic bomb would totally destroy Israel, while (the same) against the Islamic world would only cause damage. Such a scenario is not inconceivable." He says, "if the Islamic world armed itself with the same arms, then that equilibrium would be broken." He says, "We do not want the fall victim to insecurity, and we do not want the confrontation to turn into World War Three. That is the worst that could happen." He says, "if a day comes when the world of Islam is duly equipped with the arms Israel has in its possession, the strategy of colonialism would face a stalemate because application of an atomic bomb would not leave anything in Israel but the same thing would just produce damages in the Muslim world."

The United States claims that Belarus is acting as a proxy for Russia in negotiating sales of technology to Iran. The deals are being handled in Tehran by the Belarusian military officer Rybak.
Talks break down between Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and French officials over repayment of French debt to Iran after Iran demanded access to enriched uranium from Eurodif's enrichment plant in Drome, southern France. France refuses Iran's request for enriched uranium, but the Teheran Times denies the request was ever made. The dispute stems from the Shah's $1 billion investment or loan to the French Energy Commissariat for the construction of Eurodif's plant. France has paid back $630 million, but Iran and France disagree on the total debt France owes from interest on the debt.

Khatami states that Iran's nuclear activities are well within the guidelines of international treaties and that Tehran has no obligation to go beyond them.
Tehran rejects Britain, France, and Germany's offer for technology cooperation.
Tehran's Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran reports Benjamin Netanyahu has once again accused Iran of attempting to obtain nuclear technologies for building weapons of mass destruction (WMD). At the same time the leadership of the Labor Party, which opposes Tel Aviv's ruling party, seeks to cajole Russia into abating its alleged nuclear technology transfers with Iran by appealing to France to apply pressure.
Terry Taylor, the assistant director of the institute and editor-in-chief of Military Balance, says rumors of the qualitative gap between Iran's and Israel's armies will not be affected by Iran's procurement of nuclear technology. Taylor asserts, "Israel has the regional monopoly on the nuclear and satellite subjects. The edge continues to be most significant and there is no place for hasty conclusions only in view of the weapons transactions by Arab countries."
Testifying before the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Mossad Chief Meir Dagan asserts that Iran's nuclear program is almost at the "point of no return" and could build a bomb in less than three years.

According to the Tehran Times, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Bolton, currently on a visit to Moscow, admits that Iran's nuclear program is of peaceful intent. The paper suggests that this therefore is proof that U.S. allegations regarding Iran's activities were only "propaganda."
A Chinese cyclotron is installed at Karaj.
The Arab states of Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia criticize the IAEA of being pro-Israel in their dealings with Iran by singling them out and therefore causing a serious threat to the stability of the entire region. According to the BBC, the Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal claims at a UN General Assembly, "What surprises us is that at a time when the [IAEA] is intensifying its efforts and monitoring [NPT] member countries, we see that it continues to ignore the rejection of Israel in not joining the treaty."
The Arms Control Reporter reports that by December 1991, Iran had imported four nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union, including a nuclear artillery shell, two nuclear warheads that could be launched on Scud missiles, and one nuclear weapon that could be delivered by a MiG-27 aircraft. [Note: See 24 May 2002 entry.] The report says that fissile material was exported from Kazakhstan to Iran and the rest of the components were exported from other republics of the former Soviet Union through Turkmenistan. Although the codes to arm the warheads were not provided with the missiles, the report says two experts from Russia arrived to bypass arming codes. Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, denies that Iran has received or will receive nuclear assistance from the former Soviet Union. While a report by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) states that Iran does not have nuclear weapons, the FIS report agrees with the conclusion expressed by US CIA Director James Woolsey on 24 February 1993 that Iran could indigenously produce a nuclear bomb within 10 years. Iran denies these claims and has stated that its nuclear research is directed towards building two 1200MWe nuclear reactors at Bushehr, as well as producing cyclotrons and radioisotopes. [Note: The 1200MWe reactors are sometimes referred to as 1293MW. See 3 December 1996 and 6 March 1990.]
The Associated Press reports that a nuclear power plant will soon be connected to Iran electricity grid, which is the first indication that a nuclear facility is near completion. A deputy governor of Southern Bushehr Province says that the plant will come on stream during an "imminent" visit by President Hashemi Rafsanjani; this visit has not been announced.
The Associated Press reports that, according to US and Iranian sources, Iran is procuring nuclear weapons technology from the former Soviet republics and China. [Note: See 1985-1990 entry.] According to the Mojahedin-e Khalq of Iran, the Islamic Republic entered into a deal to buy two 450MW nuclear reactors from the former Soviet Union. [Note: This may refer to two 440MW reactors, rather than 450MW.] In addition, the group reports that experts from Turkmenistan completed a geological survey to determine whether the two reactors could be installed northeast of Gorgan, adjacent to the Caspian Sea. Iran is still trying to purchase a reactor from China, and has purchased from China calutron equipment and giant magnets used to make weapons grade plutonium, according to the Mojahedin. The group also states that Iran has recruited many highly paid nuclear experts from the former Soviet republics and that Iranian President Rafsanjani ordered Iranian nuclear experts to Europe to work at nuclear labor and technologies companies in order to procure nuclear secrets. [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
The Atomic Energy Ministry of Russia has drawn up a plan for the return of spent nuclear fuel from the Iranian plant. Valery Lebedev, Russia's Atomic Energy Deputy Minister states, "Russia will strictly adhere to the principles of the International Atomic Energy Agency, under which spent nuclear fuel must be returned to the country supplying the fuel." The Ministry adds that spent fuel would be held for three years in a cooling tank at the Iranian plant before it is returned to Russia due to the requirement of its transport.
According to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Iran tried to acquire technology and equipment for weapons of mass destruction from Russia, China, and North Korea. The CIA's Non-Proliferation Center reports "In doing so, Tehran is attempting to develop an indigenous capability to produce various types of weapons nuclear, chemical and biological â and their delivery systems." Iran's system of acquiring nuclear technology has become more efficient and modern, the CIA reports, and uses this "guise, to obtain whole facilities, such as a uranium conversion facility, that in fact could be used in any number of ways in support of efforts to produce fissile material needed for a nuclear weapon."

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) criticizes Germany for not allowing completion of the Bushehr nuclear power plant by a German company. "Iran cannot remain indifferent to this decision," says the statement from the AEOI. "Rather than halt work on the project for security reasons and suggest the building of a gas-powered station, the German government should have proposed modernizing the Bushehr facility." German Economic Minister Juergen Moelleman, on a trip to Tehran, tries to persuade Iranian officials from rebuilding the Bushehr plant. [Note: See June 1991 entry for Germany's announcement that it will not to allow Siemens-Kraftwerk Union to continue the project.]

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Environmental Protection Organization agree to cooperate in joint projects, especially the marine environment, and to meet to review any nuclear incidents.
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran denies that atomic power plant equipment from the dismantled Zwentendorf nuclear energy plant in Vienna is destined for the Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran. The equipment has been sold to the Russian company Mosenergomontash, reports IDPC, the Austrian company responsible for the equipment. According to Michael Machura, head of the IDPC, the "equipment is old and worn out. It cannot at all be used at the Bushehr atomic power plant, which is currently under construction." Machura affirms that installation of any equipment in the Bushehr plant would fall under the purview of the International Atomic Energy Agency. [Note: See also 3, 7, and 8 November 1997.]
According to the Washington Post, to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons, US officials privately offer a potentially lucrative economic package to Russia in exchange for halting construction of the nuclear reactor in Bushehr and other nuclear cooperation with Tehran; however, Russia has resisted the proposal. Yuri Bespalko, a spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry says "Americans are being rather sly when they offer this kind of swap... It's better to have a bird in the hand than two in the bush."
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran issues a report rejecting a US accusation that Iran had stolen a portion of a US uranium shipment from Kazakhstan. According to reports, the shipment contained enough uranium to make 21 nuclear bombs. However, uranium sufficient to make two nuclear bombs was reported missing from the original mass. Subsequently, the United States accused Iran of the stealing the missing uranium.
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran issues a statement saying that it does not have a nuclear weapons program. This statement is in response to reports of underground columns in the city of Yazd.

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran reports that it manufactured two nuclear processed radio-drugs, Talium (heart related) and Galium (cancer related). The AEOI claims it is only producing Talium and Galium at one-eighth of its production capacity (sufficient for domestic use). The AEOI says if the two drugs were produced at full capacity, Iran would be able to export them.
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran says it will send a "number of men" to Russia in order to train them for technical positions at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran.
The Atommash association in Volgodonsk begins shipping parts for the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
The Australian press reports on a top secret US policy for using nuclear weapons against Iraq. A senior Clinton advisor is quoted as saying, "It is US policy to target nuclear weapons if there is the use of weapons of mass destruction. Whether we would use it is another matter." It is assumed that Iran would be similarly targeted if there was an attack using weapons of mass destruction on US interests.
The BBC Summary of World Broadcasts reports that Iran and Russia plan to sign a joint declaration for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to build a nuclear power plant in Iran. The signing ceremony is to be held at the opening of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Geneva on 21 September. The cooperation between the two countries will be for the cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, joint research, the training of personnel, as well as industrial production of materials necessary for use in nuclear reactors, and the nuclear fuel cycle. However, none of this material or equipment is to be used military purposes, and is to be under strict IAEA safeguards control for the full period of their use.
The Belgian firm Ion Beam Applications signs a contract to sell a cyclotron to Iran. Iran says that the cyclotron will be used for medical purposes, although it may have other applications. IBA already has acquired an export permit. [Note: See 1991 and 11 May 1991 entries.]

The Boston Globe reports that on his recent trip to the United States, Mohammed Mohaddessin, foreign policy spokesman for the Mojahedin Iranian opposition group, says Iran is seeking nuclear weapons. "What the regime is doing," he says, "is concentrating on research in order to develop nuclear weapons themselves. They are looking for technical assistance, for materials." He says, however, Iran is far from developing nuclear technology. He claims that Iran has created a special unit of the Republican Guards to secretly develop nuclear weapons out of sight of the International Atomic Energy Agency. "The regime is doing their utmost to get assistance from Western Europe," he says. "They have had extensive discussions and negotiations concerning this matter with France, Italy, and Germany. They have sent a number of their experts and researchers to China for training purposes and to obtain expertise." The Chinese foreign ministry denies a report that an Iranian delegation was in China to discuss nuclear technology. Spokesmen for the White House and US State Department say there is no proof that China has sold nuclear technology to Iran. [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program. See 14 June 2001 for other claims by Mohaddessin. See February 1991 and 13 January 1994 for other meetings between Iran and Germany.]

Victor Kozlov, director of Atomstroyeksport, says, "guided by the results of work on the first power unit, the sides are now discussing a possibility of completing construction of the second unit." He adds that the construction contract might be signed in the coming two years.
The British government disputes a claim by the BBC that it sold beryllium to Iran, which is used in the development of nuclear weapons. The British Foreign Office Minister Mike O'Brien says that the export of less than one-half of an ounce of this precious metal was "not of concern with respect to use in weapons of mass destruction."
The British-Dutch company Urenco denies the suggestions by the Russian government that it has provided enrichment equipment to Iran, and demands that these allegations be immediately withdrawn.
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists reports that Iran has imported un safeguarded enriched uranium from an unknown country and calutron magnet cores from West Germany.
The Bulletin of AtomicScientists releases a report on Iran's nuclear program.According to the report, US officials, such as James Woolsey,the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency have put the timeframe for Iran's nuclear program to be weapon-capable by early next century. According to the report,Iran needs fissile material to build a nuclear weapon, and its prospects for manufacturing this material are not very high unless it overcomes certain logistical obstacles such as management issues, the lack of technological and technical skills, as well as the general lack of infrastructure.Although Iran has the money to acquire this material from illicit foreign sources, US intelligence officials say that dependence on foreign sources for this material is uncertain,and Iran's tactic is expected to contain plans to develop an indigenous facility to produce fissile materials as well. Iranhas been in the market for the acquisition of dual-use material, but has so far not succeeded in acquiring fissile materials. Iran has several research reactors, one provided by the United States that runs on low-enriched uranium, and others provided by China; none of which are believed to be capable of weapons production. The United States had also provided 'hot cells,' which are "heavily shielded rooms with remotely operated arms used to chemically separate material irradiated in the research reactor, possibly including plutonium laden 'targets'." Additionally, according to source sin the US government "China has also helped Iran create nuclear fuel facilities for uranium mining, fuel fabrication,uranium purification, and zirconium tube production, and it may soon supply facilities to produce uranium metal and uranium hexafluoride." China also signed in 1992 a"preliminary agreement" for the supply of two 300MW electric light water reactors, without specified delivery dates. All of China's activities however are reportedly consistent with the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as well as being under IAEAsafeguard. China is not thought to be helping Iran with weapons production. It is not clear according to US sources that Iran has made a choice about having an indigenous production of fissile material or whether to acquire it from illicit sources. According to Warren Christopher, US Secretaryof State, Iran has been in the market for "heavy water research reactors that are best suited to producing weapon-grade plutonium, not electricity." According to a senior US government official, Iran is now focusing on centrifuge designs and "looking toward a pilot plant, possibly large enough to produce enough highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons." Iran however still lacks the technical capability to manufacture these centrifuges and still has to rely on the import of technical skill as well as the hardware.[Note: The United States gave Iran hot cells in the 1960s; see1960s.]
The Bush administration decides to impose new penalties on Chinese, Armenian, and Moldavian companies believed to be assisting Iran's weapon of mass destruction program. These entities are Lizen Open Joint Stock Company and Armen Sargasian, Armenia; LiyangYunlong, Aka Liyang Chemical Equipment Company, Zibo Chenmical Equipment Plant, Aka Chemet Global Ltd, China Mational Machinery and Electric Equipment Import and Export, Wha Cheong Tai Comapny, China Shipbuilding Trading Company, The China Precision Machinsery Import/Export Corporation, The China National Aero-Technology Import and Export, QC Chen, China; Cuanta SA, Mikhail Pavlovitch, Moldova.

The Chinese ambassador to Iran, Hua Liming, states that nuclear cooperation between Tehran and Beijing to build a nuclear power plant will continue despite Western objections.
According to Yevgeniy Reshetnikov, Russia's Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy, Iran recently paid Russia its first installment for building the nuclear power reactor in Bushehr. Iran has also paid Russia for its nuclear technicians working on the project. [Note: See 16 March 1997]. The Russians have started construction on "steam generators and other equipment with a long production cycle." Reshetnikov says that Iran has paid 10% of the total project cost, which is approximately $800 million. He also says the project is on schedule. [Note: See 16 March 1997. Alexsandr Steblyanko, the chief of construction, says the project was one year behind schedule.]
The Christian Science Monitor reports that China has quietly relayed to the Clinton administration that it is cancelling the sale of a uranium hexafluoride conversion plant to Iran. [Note: See 4 November 1996.]
The Christian Science Monitorpublishes a detailed article on Russian cooperation with Iranon the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Of the nuclear cooperation, John Bolton, undersecretary of state in charge o farms control, says, "The quality of the relationship with Russia really depends fundamentally on how they address this question in the future." Valentin Tikhonov, an expert from the Russian Academy of Sciences, says, "The new generation [of nuclear experts] may work in Iran, and may work on nuclear weapons because their lives are too hard and they want money,money, money." An unnamed senior US official says Russia "is giving meaningful help [to Iran] in mastering the nuclear-fuel cycle, and some critical technologies like sophisticated metal alloys [and for] laser isotope separation techniques...that are involved in building the bomb. There's enough to see a pattern of a determined Iran effort that unfortunately struck positive responses from some Russian entities." The official says, "If their [the Russians'] security is as effective as they claim it to be, and we think it is, they should be able to track these things down. They know who is flying onAeroflot to Tehran." Vladimir Orlov, head of the PIR Center, a think tank in Moscow, says, "There is practically zero risk that Iran will use the Bushehr power plant for nuclear proliferation," noting that Russia will supply all the fu eland take back spent fuel. "Russia does n't want and will notsupportany ambitions of Iran which may be interpreted as nuclear weapons ambitions." Rose Gottemoeller, former USdeputy undersecretary of Energy responsible for nonproliferation, says, "Everyone else has cut off cooperation with Iran on nuclear technology, including the Chinese." Shesays the real risk is "bottom feeders small Russian industrial or research institutions that are desperate, or they would n't be trying to take extreme measures, such as false invoices...to mask their sales." She says that although most Russian entities will follow export rules, "...the Russiansystem being what it is, I'm sure there are others who could pop out of the mud at any time." Gary Samore, a special adviser to President Clinton on nonproliferation now at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, says, "There maybe a real opportunity now, post-September 11, for the US and Russia to work out an agreement that would give the Russians a strong incentive to go all the way in enforcing what they say is their policy." He says the United States should accept and"grandfather" the Bushehr deal and give Russia incentives for limiting the deal by taking responsibility for fuel supplies and forcing Iran to publicly commit to not seeking a fuel-cycle and to agree to tougher IAEA inspections. "Thesooner you can step in to slow down or stop [Iran's] program,the better," he says. "If we just let the situation drift and don't do anything, they will get closer and closer, and will eventually reach the technical point of no return." [Note: See11 July 2002 entry.]
The CIA issues a report that says Iran "remains one of the most active countries seeking to acquire (weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional weapons) technology from abroad....In doing so, Tehran is attempting to develop a domestic capability to produce various types of weapons chemical, biological, nuclearâand their delivery systems."
The CIA issues a report that says, "During the second half of 2000, entities in Russia, North Korea, and China continued to supply crucial ballistic missile-related equipment, technology, and expertise to Iran. Teheran is attempting to develop a domestic capability to produce various types of weapons...and their delivery systems." The report also states, "The expertise and technology gained, along with the commercial channels and contacts established particularly through the Bushehr nuclear power plant projectâcould be used to advance Iran's nuclear weapons research and development program."
The CIA publishes a report that says in 1999, Russia was one of Iran's main sources of parts and technology for the creation of weapons of mass destruction.
The CIA releases a report on Iran's nuclear program that reads, "During the first half of 1999, Russia also remained a key supplier for civilian nuclear programs in Iran. With respect to Iran's nuclear infrastructure, Russian assistance enhances Iran's ability to support a nuclear weapons development effort. By its very nature, even the transfer of civilian technology may be of use in Iran's nuclear weapons program....Russia has reiterated previous commitments to observe certain limits on its nuclear cooperation with Iran, such as not providing militarily useful nuclear technology, although as indicated aboveâRussia continues to provide Iran with nuclear technology that could be applied to Iran's weapons program."
The CIA releases an unclassified version of its report to Congress outlining concerns over various countries, including Iran spreading technology or expertise that can be used to make WMD. Thereport, covering all activities between July 1 and December31, 2003, affirms that Iran "vigorously" pursued programs to produce nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in late2003, and is currently working to improve delivery systems.The report also discusses serious concerns regarding Pakistaniscientist A.Q. Khan and his network's involvement with Iran.Specifically, the report addresses the following:* In 2003, Iran continued to pursue an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle with clear weapons potential* Beginning August 2002, an Iranian opposition group revealed several previously undisclosed nuclear facilities in Iran* The IAEA has reported several failures by Iran to disclose facilities and activities, contrary to its safeguards obligations* A.Q. Khan's network provided Iran with designs for Pakistan's older centrifuges, as well as designs for more advanced and efficient models and components* The IAEA has reported further evidence of Iran breaching its obligations under the NPT, including failures to report: * report the importation and chemical conversion of uranium compounds* report the separation of plutonium from irradiated uranium targets* report the enrichment of uranium using centrifuges and lasers* provide the design information for numerous fuel cycle facilities Furthermore, the CIA report affirms that although Iransigned the Additional Protocol on December 18, 2003, it has taken no steps to ratify it during the reporting period.
The CIA reports that Iran may be capable of producing a nuclear weapon now. This assessment is based on the fact that Western intelligence has not been able to track the exchanges that are occurring on Iran's part, so the CIA cannot rule out the possibility that Iran may have the weapons. Russia continues to cooperate with Iran but deny aiding them with a weapons program. Iran also continues to deny that they are pursuing a weapons program. According to David Albright, a nuclear analyst in Washington, "Iran has made it clear that it will not be the last major country in the region to develop nuclear weapons."
The CIA says Russia has given important nuclear technology to Iran this year. [Note: In July 1997, the Clinton administration complains of these transfers to Russian President Boris Yeltsin.]

The Czech engineering firm, Skoda, considers selling nuclear technology to Iran; Skoda first attempts to do so in cooperation with Germany's Siemens. When Siemens refuses, Skoda pursues the matter on its own with the support of Czech industry minister, Vladimir Dlouhy. However, sharp Western protests causes Skoda to abandon the effort. Frantisek Svitak, Vice President of Skoda's nuclear division, says later that Skoda would not sell nuclear technology directly to Iran until adequate nuclear safeguards were in place. Svitak, however, indicates that Czech nuclear technology sold to Russia could end up in Iran.
The Czech firms [ZVVZ] Milevsko and Skoda Praha win a contract for the delivery of ventilation equipment for the Russian companies completing the construction of the nuclear power plant Bushehr.
The Czech newspaper Lidove Noviny reports that Great Britain and the United States protested the planned delivery of items for the nuclear power plant in Bushehr, Iran. Both countries fear Iran will misuse the products to develop nuclear weapons. Though the Iranian deal means significant revenue for the Czech company ZVVZ Milevsko, any potential profit may be offset by sanctions imposed by the United States or Britain. Thus far, nineteen countries have turned down Iran's offer to supply it with equipment for its nuclear power plant, which in turn may cast the Czech Republic as a political pariah among its European counterparts. [Note: See 30 April 2000.]
The Daily Yomiuri reports Israeli officials met with their North Korean counterparts in an effort to convince North Korea not to provide Iran with nuclear technology and Nodong-1 missiles. Israel believes the missiles would be able to hit Israel and other nations of the Persian Gulf and has asked North Korea in the past to forego any sales to Iran.
The deputy director of Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant announces that Iran has signed an $800 million contract for Russia to complete construction of the plant. According to the Iranian official named only as Mr. Khabir, Russia agrees to complete the first of the plant's two units within four years. According to the official, the plant's first unit was 90% complete with 60% of its equipment installed before Kraftwerk Union halted construction. The plant's second unit was 50% complete when construction was stopped, the official says. He also mentions that forty Iranian companies will be involved in the project. Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations issues a press release regretting a 5 January New York Times article that quotes US Defense Secretary William Perry as saying Iran could build a nuclear bomb in five years. "Iran simply does not have the ambitions to become a nuclear weapon state and as a matter of national policy it has denounced nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction," the Iranian press release says. The IAEA has conducted routine and unannounced inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities, the latest of which was done from 15 to 21 November 1993, the press release says. [Note: Khabir's statements come one day before the deal was actually signed. See 8 January 1995.]
The deputy of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran chastises the German government for not fulfilling its commitment to complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He also adds that despite the concerns from some countries, Bushehr has no military application. The deputy says, "We have begun discussions with China about the establishment of new power stations." German Economics Affairs Minister Juergen Moellemann says no German firm, including Siemens AG, will be allowed to complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
The deputy Russian atomic energy minister says that Russia has decided to complete the nuclear reactor in Bushehr. He adds that all necessary documents for the construction of two other new reactors have been prepared.
The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguard division, identified as H. Tanei, says in a letter to Iran's IAEA mission that there is no evidence Iran has received nuclear materials.
The director of the Czech firm Skoda Plzen, Lubomir Soudek, visits Tehran to discuss "energy cooperation" and "possible component deliveries for the construction of a nuclear power plant." US intelligence sources believe that Iran has a clandestine program to develop nuclear arms and the United States fears that Czech supplies could help Iran produce nuclear waste from which it could extract plutonium for a nuclear bomb.
According to Zeef Schiff, an editorialist for Haaretz in Tel Aviv, Israel must modernize its defensive capabilities sufficiently to compensate for its adherence to a strategic doctrine originally written in 1956. This doctrine, anachronistic in light of contemporary issues facing Israel, is insufficient to properly protect Israel from attack. Due to territorial changes Schiff believes that Israel will need to concentrate on early warning systems based on satellite technology to negate threats posed by newly developed weapon systems in neighboring countries such as Syria, Iran, and Iraq.
A Chinese nuclear engineer working with a group of Chinese experts for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran on the construction of uranium enrichment plants at Rudan in Shiraz, in southeastern Iran is kidnapped. Two Iranian technicians are kidnapped at the same time, and it is likely that the three experts had critical classified information on Iran's nuclear program. Iran's Interior Ministry acknowledges the disappearances in mid-June. Iran says seven people working on mining and uranium conversion in Fasa, southern Iran, have disappeared. They also include three North Korean technicians, an Australian, and two Iranian technicians.
The director of the open joint-stock company Tsenrtenerhamantazh of Minsk, Belarus, says the company has won a contract to the build the turbine shop for the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
The discovery in Iran of undeclared designs for centrifuge technology that is key to producing bomb-grade material has led U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton to stress again the U.S. conviction that Iran's nuclear aims are not peaceful. In addition, Bolton questions Iran's commitment to suspending uranium enrichment activities.
The Economist reports that Iran has plans to obtain "a few" power reactors through legitimate channels from China and India.
The Egyptian newspaper al-Akhbar criticizes US pressure on its allies to join it in on imposing a trade ban on Iran. The United States is further criticized by the newspaper for exercising a double standard in the Middle East by condemning and isolating Iran for possible nuclear aspirations without taking any actions against Israel.
The Emirates Center for Strategic Studies criticizes nuclear cooperation between Iran and Russia and warns that it reflects Iran's desire to become the regional power in the Middle East. Regarding statements that Igor Sergeyev, the Russian defense minister, made about Russia's intent to carry out mutual agreements signed with Iran in 1998 and 1999, the center said that the statements were a surprise since Russia and Iran claim that their cooperation would not include developing Iran's nuclear capabilities for military use. According to the center, the statements were made two weeks after Russia assured that it is resolved to speed up the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power station. After meeting with Sergeyev in Moscow, the General Secretary of the Iranian National Security Council, Hassan Ruhani, said that the Russian-Iranian cooperation is "being conducted in the framework of international law and is characterized by transparency." He also reportedly stated that "any interference on the part of a third party in our relations is unacceptable." After meeting with Ruhani, Aylia Klibanov, the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, said that Iran may request three nuclear power plants from Russia and that the prospective deal "complies with all international obligations related to organizing the use of nuclear energy."
The English newspaper times online.co m reports that it acquired a confidential IAEA report that states that Iran has "failed to meet its obligations...with respect to the reporting of nuclear material, the processing and use of that material, and the declaration of facilities where the material was stored and processed."
The European Commission has declared the EU's preparedness to resume trade talks with Iran this week, pursuant to Tehran's suspension of uranium enrichment activities.
The European of London reports that the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service has said that Iran definitely received two warheads stolen from Semipalatinsk. The report says that the organization selling the weapons had ties to Kazakhstan President Nursaltan Nazarbayev.
The exiled Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), alleges that Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan gave Iran weapons grade uranium and a design for a nuclear bomb. According to the same group, Khan had already given a quantity of HEU (highly enriched uranium) to Iran in 2001. Iran is purportedly also secretly enriching uranium at a military site previously unknown to the IAEA, even though it promised to halt all such work.
The Federal German Intelligence Service (BND) says "the radical-Islamic 'theocratic state' wants to possess medium-range missiles equipped with nuclear warheads within a decade." The "theocratic state" it is referring to is Iran, which it believes is pursuing the darker half of dual-use technologies despite Iran's constant promulgations that it seeks only to acquire civilian-use nuclear technology. Groups within Germany believe the role of Russia in supplying nuclear technology needs to be reexamined, stating that items proven to be outside the capability of Iran's nuclear development still find their way into Iran's nuclear program.
The Federal Intelligence Service (BND) of Germany reports that "in addition to 'legal' purchases for its several hundred companies in Iran, the foundation also procures goods for Iran's nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and missile programs. Fake companies in Iran and abroad are often used as intermediaries for this purpose."
The Federation of American Scientists reports that due to a lack of infrastructure within the country, Iran's nuclear weapons program is not expected to advance without significant foreign assistance. Iran is thought to be unable to manage the production of weapons-grade nuclear material. To shorten the projected period to acquire these materials, Iran is attempting to develop the capability to produce both highly enriched uranium as well as plutonium, while simultaneously trying to acquire fissile material from outside sources, mainly those that were the former Soviet Union. Iran's claims are that they are trying to launch a complete nuclear fuel cycle for their civilian nuclear holdings; however, this is the same fuel cycle that could support a weapons program. The CIA recently said that Iran's nuclear weapons capability can no longer be ruled out; this assessment comes, however, on the basis that the United States is not able to clearly track the advances that Iran is making.
Admiral Ali Shamkhani, Iran's minister of defense, states that Iran believes the Middle East and the Persian Gulf should be free of non-conventional arms. Shamkhani emphasizes Iran's policy against any nuclear test conducted to further nuclear weapons manufacturing expertise. This statement comes as a result of nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan. Shamkhani says Iran will remain in compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and opposes states in and outside the region that wish to obtain nuclear weapons. But he stresses the importance of allowing states to pursue peaceful use of nuclear technology.
The final settlement on the Eurodif dispute is reached, and reports persist of a "secret clause" allowing Iran to purchase French uranium. France insisted it will not allow future Eurodif enriched uranium transfers to Iran.
The Financial Times reports that in July 1995, the International Institute of Strategic Studies will release a research paper by Ahmed Hashim on the Iranian government's capability to gain and keep support for nuclear weapons development. Hashim, a senior official at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC claims "intense political factionalism" reduces Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons, because government must have the "ability to reach a consensus on the need for nuclearisation."
The Financial Times reports that Iran threatened to sue the German electronics company Siemens AG for refusing to complete construction of nuclear power plant begun in 1975 at Bushehr.
The Financial Times reports the Czech Republic will no longer provide Iran with equipment or know-how for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. This decision comes in the face of considerable scrutiny from the United States and the United Kingdom.
The first deputy speaker of Russia's State Duma, Mikhail Mityukov, says the details of the nuclear cooperation agreement between Russia and Iran will not be subject to review by the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission and no changes will be made to the agreement. Russia's Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov announces Russia will uphold its obligations to Iran for the "peaceful use of nuclear energy." [Note: See 11 May 1995.]
The footing for a reactor at Bushehr ships from Volgodonsk en route to Iran. The piece was made by Atommash, a Russian producer of nuclear power plant equipment.
The Foreign Affairs Committee of the US House of Representatives approves a bill that would bar financial aid to any country that sells nuclear technology and weapons to Iran. The bill would affect about 25% of aid to Russia, but would not affect aid to dismantle Russia's nuclear weapons. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma International Affairs Committee, calls the move "not very wise" and says in trying to persuade Russia the committee's math does not add up: "The entire aid the US is giving to Russia totals $400 million, while Russia's deal with Iran is estimated at $1 billion."
The Foreign Minister of Iran invites Western countries to participate in the building of new nuclear plants in Iran. Mr. Kharazi also pledges to sign the IAEA's additional protocol if Iran gets access to the most modern atomic technologies.
After a recent trip to Iran, Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov says Iran and Russia have reached an agreement for Iran to pays its debt to Russia with $230 million worth of oil and $150 million in cash. [Note: It is not clear if this agreement directly affects the construction by Russia of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.]
The foreign ministers of the European Union call on Iran to abide by nuclear non-proliferation agreements.
The foreign ministers of the UK, France and Germany sign a letter stating progress is "not as fast as we would wish, we believe we are moving in the right directions...if Iran does not abide by its agreement...we shall have no choice but to support referring Iran's nuclear por gramme to the UN Security Council."
The Foreign Ministry of Germany intervenes with the Foreign Ministry of Austria to determine whether parts from the "dead" Zwentendorf nuclear power plant in Vienna are headed for Iran. Germany believes the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran may be attempting to buy the parts. The Austrian company asserts each piece has been carefully cataloged to prevent any illicit trade. [Note: See 3, 8, and 11 November 1997.]
The Frankfurt Administrative Court decides that the German embargo on Iran includes services for increasing nuclear safety, in addition to technology for nuclear plants. The German government had denied a license to an engineering firm planning to help examine the "external concrete claddings of the two reactor blocks at the Bushehr nuclear power plant." The company said that it would only "examine the statistics of the nuclear plant's concrete cladding," which would help improve the safety of the facility. [Note: See 21 March 1997.]
The French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas says Iran's demand for enriched uranium from France is the main obstacle to solving a longtime debt dispute between the two countries. "There is a still a major point which is the right or not to have uranium," Dumas says. "I think that we shall find a formula." [Note: See 8 July 1991.]
The French newspaper, Le Nouvel Observateur, reports that the Israeli secret service believes Iran, after failing to obtain nuclear technology from China, North Korea, and Russia, began communications with the Republic of South Africa on acquiring uranium enriching equipment and technical guidance. The report further states that the source of this expertise is of Israeli origin, and that the Iranian Foreign Minister, Kamal Kharazi, has met three times with officials in Pretoria and is alleged to have reached an agreement.
The French weekly Le Point reports that the Czech firm Skoda Plzen has signed a contract to provide Iran with technology for nuclear reactors in exchange for petroleum products.
The General Director of Atomstoiexport Victor Kozlov tells Interfax that the war in Iraq will not affect the completion date of Bushehr's first power producing unit. The construction of Bushehr is to continue as planned without postponement.
The general director of the Czech Republic's Skoda factory, Lubomir Soubek, says that his company intends to export a variety of products, including equipment for sugar refineries, to Iran. However, Soubek denies that Skoda was involved in Iran's nuclear program, saying "Skoda is not building any nuclear power plant in Iran, nor is it supplying to Iran nuclear reactors or other sensitive items."
The general director of the Russian nuclear organization says that the financial problems between Russia and Iran that were facing the completion of the Bushehr power plant have been resolved.
The German company Kraftwerk Union (KWU) finalizes plans to complete two reactors begun at Bushehr in 1976.
After being pressured by the United States, China holds off on its offer to sell Iran a nuclear reactor [rated around 27MW]. [Note: The 27MW reactor proposed for installation at Isfahan by China but never realized should not be confused with a 27kWt Chinese-supplied reactor at Isfahan that went critical March 1994. For entries on the 27kWt reactor, see 1991, September 1991, March 1994, and 7 September 1995. For entries on the 27MW reactor, see 21 January 1990, 14 March 1990, June 1990, November 1991, and 1 June 1995.]
The German company Siemens states that Iran has asked an international board of arbitration in Switzerland to implement the compensation for damages due for not finishing construction on the nuclear reactor in Bushehr. A spokesman for the company would not comment on whether Iran is asking for 8 billion marks. The board of arbitration declared the contracts between Iran and Siemens as closed in 1982 and mutual demands for compensation impossible. Therefore, the present actions by Iran are not understood by many observers.
The German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT) issues a report stating that the Physics Research Center (PHRC) at Sharif University is involved in the procurement of "nuclear-related materials" and that the Educational Research Institute (ERI) and the Iranian Research and Development Organization are "wholly or in part devoted to military projects...with the aim of supplying know-how, equipment, and materials." As a result of German intelligence reports in 1992 and 1993, the German export control review body, the Bundesamt fÃŒr Wirtschaft (BAW), was instructed to deny all requests by Sharif University to import equipment from Germany.
The German government announces that it will not permit Siemens-Kraftwerk Union to complete Iran's Bushehr reactors, and that Empresarios Agrupados of Spain, a Siemens' licensee, will also be prohibited from completing the reactors. Germany has paid Iran 300 million DM for parts not delivered, but Iran may seek 5 billion DM in damages. The German delegation says the reason for not allowing continuation of the project is because of the lack of security at the plant. Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran needs to spend $30 million to secure the site for construction, while Iran would lose $10 billion if the plant is not finished. [Note: See 29 June 1991 entry for Iran's response to the decision.]
After Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's five-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, Iran and Saudi Arabia issue a joint statement in which the two countries "expressed their support for turning the Middle East into a zone free from weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, expressing their absolute belief that Israel's policy, based on producing and stockpiling types of weapons of mass destruction and its non-compliance with international laws and treaties poses a real and serious threat to peace and security in the region."
The German government reaffirms that it will refuse to grant Siemens an export license to complete the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran. The announcement came from the Economics Ministry in response to the news that Iran would file a lawsuit against Siemens with the International Chambers of Commerce in Paris.
The German press speculates that Iran and North Korea have made a secret agreement to jointly develop nuclear weapons.
The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission will review the issue of a potential deal for Iranian nuclear experts to be trained in Russia, says Georgiy Kaurov, head of the information directorate of the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy. [See 11 May 1995 for more on the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission. See 4 May 1995 for more on the possibility of Russia training Iranian nuclear experts.] Kaurov says the Iranian experts would be trained to operate the Russian-made reactors to be installed at Bushehr. Kaurov also mentions the possibility of a deal for building more reactors: "Specialists will have to be trained to operate Russian-made equipment anyway, bearing in mind the nuclear ministry is planning to conclude more contracts with Iran on the construction of another three power units with light water reactors." [See 5 May 1995 for more on the additional reactors.] The Commission, Kaurov says, will also decide what should be done with spent nuclear fuel from the Iranian reactors, whether it should be sent to Russia for processing or stored in Iran under International Atomic Energy Agency supervision.
The Guardian of London reports that Iran has withdrawn its contribution to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization to protest against US hostility to the treaty. [Note: See 19 March and 15 April 2002.]
The Guardian reports that Iran is trying to garner support to prevent the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the United States is concurrently increasing its efforts to deny nuclear technology to Iran. Iran is annoyed that its efforts to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful use are being thwarted by nuclear suppliers following the US lead.
The Guardian reports that Republicans leaders in the United States "suspect the Russian deal includes providing Iran with reprocessing facilities." [Note: It is likely that the article is referring to enrichment facilities, not reprocessing facilities.]
The head and deputies of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran appear before the power committee of the Iranian Parliament to respond to charges of inefficiency in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. According to the Iranian daily Resalat, "because they made conflicting statements, the members of the commission decided to visit the plant in the Gulf port of Bushehr on Monday to closely investigate the situation." Resalat reports that there were "difficulties in carrying out projects in certain units of the plant." [Note: See 3 September 1997 for Reza Amrollahi's replacement as head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran.]
The head of the IAEA, Dr. Mohamed El Baradei says that the uranium enrichment plant he visited in Iran was "very sophisticated." He also states "I have impressed on the Iranian authorities the need to be fully transparent, the need to sign the additional protocol."
The head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization Gholam Reza Aqazedah presents an exhaustive sketch of Iran's nuclear program to United Nations diplomats reiterating that the program is peaceful.
The Houston Chronicle reports that Iran has ample enriched uranium to construct a nuclear warhead. The Chronicle reports that Iran is also recalling it Silkworm missiles, currently positioned in the Persian Gulf, which could be armed with a nuclear warhead in a single day.
The IAEA announces it has not been able to get additional information on Iran's more advanced centrifuge equipment or the source of nuclear contamination discovered during earlier inspections. One Western diplomat says, "It's another failure to disclose activities, which fits a disturbing pattern." Iran has refused the IAEA reentry to Parchin, a military base, because Tehran believes the requirements have been fulfilled, "and thus there is no justification for any additional visit."
After meeting with Chinese Premier Li Ping, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani says Iran will complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant despite the German government's refusal to allow a German company to take part in the project. "We are determined to complete this major project, and will do so with the help of God," Rafsanjani says in a letter to the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. [Note: See June 1991 entry for Germany's announcement that it will not allow continuation of the Bushehr project.]
The IAEA Board of Governors has adopted a resolution regarding Iran, putting into effect the NPT Safeguards Agreement. The report welcomes Iran's voluntary decision to suspend all enrichment related and reprocessing activities. IAEA Director General Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei has revealed that surveillance cameras are now in place to monitor Iran's 20 sets of centrifuge components. Meanwhile, the United States has reaffirmed its preparedness to unilaterally refer Iran to the Security Council if this is deemed necessary. Iran continues to deny allegations that it has a secret or ill-intentioned nuclear program.
The IAEA claims that Iran has not met its obligations to "account for nuclear material, report on its processing and use, and to declare facilities where the material is stored and processed."
The IAEA conducts inspections of the Kolahdouz military base in Iran. Al-Hayat claims no traces of uranium enrichment or other nuclear activity were found.
The IAEA derestricts a report on Iran. The report falls short of declaring Iran in violation of the NPT, It outlined three major issues:
The IAEA has published the agreement reached between Iran and the governments of France, Germany, and Britain. The report recognizes Iran's rights to pursue nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and reaffirms Iran's commitment to the NPT to not seek to acquire nuclear weapons. Furthermore, Iran agrees "on a voluntary basis, [to] continue and extend its suspension to include all enrichment related activities." The IAEA is to implement the monitoring of this suspension with a steering committee scheduled to meet on the issue in the first half of December 2004.
The IAEA releases a report revealing Iran's admission that it had produced a small amount of plutonium and conducted tests on uranium hexafluoride, in addition to having established a uranium enrichment plant, all of which it had earlier denied. The report says that "given Iran's past pattern of concealment, it will take some time before the agency is able to conclude that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes."
The IAEA report released today claim es no evidence of a secret weapons program in Iran but showed concern regarding its production of plutonium, often associated with bomb-making. President Khatami states that although the IAEA report was on the whole positive, it lacked balance, saying "Iran has used the plutonium for manufacturing pharmaceuticals and the IAEA experts themselves well know that such [a] negligible amount of plutonium cannot be used for making [a] bomb." Khatami asserts that the report nevertheless proved Iran's innocence regarding its alleged nuclear weapons program. Khatami concludes by saying that "Iran will never go to enrichment of uranium over the 3.5 percent [mark] which is weapons-grade," and "we understand the world's concern in this respect."
A Chinese official defends China's right to sell peaceful nuclear technology to Iran under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
The IAEA states it will not take any action on Iran on the 31 October deadline as it is still in the process of analyzing documents handed over by the Iranian government.
The IAEA tentatively concludes that equipment contaminated with HEU and found in Iran originated in Pakistan.
The IAEA's ElBaradei declares that Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran on the Bushehr reactor is not a matter for concern as it is for energy production only and there exists an agreement to return the spent fuel to Russia. ElBaradei says the Bushehr reactor was not even mentioned in his talks with President Vladimir Putin.
The IAEA's Mohamed ElBaradei is meeting in Vienna with the Board of Governors to discuss the report on Iran. ElBaradei evinced serious concern about Iran's patchy declaration on its nuclear program, suggesting it is "a setback to Iran's stated policy of transparency." Iran's ambassador Pirooz Hossein said that the declaration had never been intended to present a "full picture" of past nuclear activities, which is contrary to Iran's October statement that the declaration represented full disclosure.
The Independent reports that Israel is considering whether to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. Diplomacy thus far via the United States has failed to achieve what Israel believes is an appropriate response to Iran's increasing nuclear abilities. Israel conducted an attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1982, which was where Iraq had centralized its nuclear program. According to Israeli sources, security officials in Israel do not believe a similar attack to the one on Osirak would be successful, citing Iran's dispersed nuclear technology.
The Independent reports that the United Kingdom vice-chancellors rejected a secret government proposal to exclude students and researchers from countries such as Iran, Iraq, North Korea, China, and Libya from working at British universities in fields of study that could be useful in the development of nuclear weapons.
The Independent reports that, according to Western diplomatic sources, Iran is buying enriched uranium from Russian diplomats based in the northern city of Afghanistan, Mazar-e-Sharif. This uranium is part of the material that is being plundered out of the former Soviet Union's inadequately secured nuclear installation. According to this report, this material is smuggled to Afghanistan and the Pakistani border town of Peshawar. The enriched uranium was stolen out of a nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan by security guards as part of a "bonus" payment and was sold to the Iranians by Russian diplomats. According to this report, Mazar-e-Sharif is a transit location for smuggled materials and one with a large Russian consulate, with Peshawar as the final destination, where, according to the report, there are such dangerous smuggled goods as enriched uranium, super-powerful magnets, catalysts, and metal alloys for making thermo-nuclear warhead shelling. According to the CIA, Iran, which is secretly building a nuclear weapons program, is the leading buyer of contraband, and in Peshawar there are "Iranian colonels and majors walking around with Samsonite suitcases full of $100 bills who are shopping" for nuclear material.
The Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis reports that the Iranians were offering former Soviet scientists $5000 per month to work on special projects in Iran. There are also additional allegations that technicians from North Korea, China, Pakistan as well as Russian and the West were all at work in Iran.
The Intelligence Newsletter reports that the French firm CKD is delivering nuclear materials to Iran. The report also says that a secret clause in a French-Iranian agreement, signed on 29 December 1991, provides for the resumption in 1994 on construction on three reactors in Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that 25 people were exposed to radioactive material after an accident at a power station in Racht, northern Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency commends the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran for its cooperation with inspections made by the IAEA. The IAEA's press office says, "The Islamic Republic of Iran's cooperation with those who had visited--and visit--Iran to inspect its atomic energy industries on behalf of the IAEA has been extraordinary and much more than expected of a member of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirms that Argentina will export a shipment of 20% enriched uranium to Iran in 1993.
The International Atomic Energy Agency Department of Safeguards has twice inspected nuclear facilities that were identified in news media and intelligence reports as sites where nuclear weapons are being developed. The IAEA finds no evidence of illegal nuclear activity either time. During a visit to an Iranian nuclear facility cited as having a fissile material production pilot program, IAEA inspectors find no evidence of undeclared activities. According to diplomatic sources, the United States provides the IAEA with limited intelligence information on Iran's alleged covert nuclear activities. The United States says later that the IAEA was unable to detect the alleged activities because it did not have access to the same detailed, highly classified, intelligence information as the United States. However, not all US governmental officials agree on the validity of the US data.
The International Atomic Energy Agency requests and Iran grants visits in 1992 and 1993 and finds the visited sites were consistent with peaceful uses. These visits, however, are pronounced inconclusive because of the size of these sites and because Iran does not allow the inspectors to perform the full range inspection methods including environmental monitoring.
The International Atomic Energy Agency says it has no information on Iran acquiring nuclear warheads. The European, a weekly newspaper, reports that "Iran has obtained at least two nuclear warheads out of a batch officially listed as "missing from the newly independent republic of Kazakhstan..." The European also reports that a top secret report from Russian intelligence was sent to the CIA outlining Iran's procurement of Kazakhstan's missing nuclear warheads.
The International Atomic Energy Agency says there is no evidence that Iran is constructing nuclear weapons. The report comes after recent allegations by the United States and Israel that Iran will have a nuclear bomb within 7-15 years.
The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) awards Iran 940 million French francs as part of the settlement with the Eurodif consortium. The ICC also orders Framatome of France to pay 550 million francs to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran as reimbursement for the 271 million francs Framatome was paid for the Darkhovin reactors, plus interest.
The International Court of Arbitration rules that Iran owes French firms $710 million for the cancellation of a contract for two 900MW pressurized water reactors, which were under construction at Darkhovin. [Note: In January 1991, the court ruled French firms had to pay Iran, and on 28 February, a French court blocked the payment. See January and 28 February 1991.]
The International Herald Tribune reports that Israel has recently hinted that it will put its nuclear missiles on "launch-on-warning" alert to deter a first strike against Israel's missiles. The Tribune quotes an unnamed CIA analyst who says this is a "bluff" to dissuade Iran from investing in nuclear weapons.
The Iran Brief reports that according to US intelligence reports China, despite a May 1997 pledge not to provide nuclear technology to un safeguarded nuclear facilities, has continued its nuclear cooperation with both Iran and Pakistan.
The Iran Brief reports that China is planning to complete a uranium hexafluoride plant in Iran, according to US and International Atomic Energy Agency officials. [NOTE: In November 1996, China formally pledged to the United States that it would pull out of the project. See November 1996.]
The Iran Brief reports that Iran has signed an agreement with China for the sale of nuclear power reactors, according to Iranian news sources. The two new reactors are expected to cost between $800 million and $900 million. Referring to previous oppositional sentiment expressed by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, says, "There is no international law or international regulation or international agreement that prohibits such cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy." China has helped Iran in the past with construction of mining, milling, and enrichment facilities for Iran's uranium supplies, and began construction of a 27MW research reactor in Isfahan. [This probably refers to a 27kWt reactor that China built at Isfahan. The 27MW reactor proposed for installation at Isfahan by China but never realized should not be confused with the 27kWt Chinese-supplied reactor at Isfahan that went critical March 1994. For entries on the 27 kWt reactor, see 1991, September 1991, March 1994, and 7 September 1995. For entries on the 27MW reactor, see 21 January 1990, 14 March 1990, June 1990, and November 1991. See 30 May 1995 entry for a report that Iran was going to buy only one additional reactor from China.]
The Iran Brief reports that the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom) is discussing the purchase of technology and equipment from the unfinished Hanau research reactor, in Germany, with the German government. According to unnamed sources, Minatom may seek to acquire technical data in order to use the German equipment stored at Iran's unfinished Bushehr nuclear reactor.
The Iran Brief reports that, according to Iranfax, Iran is capable of producing uranium hexafluoride, or "hex," which can be used for fuel in the centrifuge uranium enrichment process that produces weapon-grade fuel. Hex is created by combining a fluorification agent and processed uranium, the fluorification agent in the case of Iran being hydrogen fluoride. The latter ingredient was supposedly obtained from German and China in large amounts. Iranfax reports that European export control officials have been investigating purchases of dual-purpose technologies by Iran that can be used in centrifuge enrichment programs. Semi-permeable membrane technology from European sources and Japan, Iranfax states, can be used to make uranium hexafluoride gas.
The Iran Brief reports that, according to US and Israeli intelligence officials, Iran will acquire a nuclear bomb "in more or less five years." [Note: See the other 9 January 1995 for a different estimate.] The report says US Department of Energy (DOE) officials have "almost no doubt" that Iran obtained nuclear material from the Central Asian Republics, and "if Iranians maintain this intensive effort to get everything they need, they could have all their components in two years. Then it will be just a matter of technology and research."
After meeting with the head of Iran's National Security Council Hassan Rohani, Russian President Vladimir Putin says, "We will continue to cooperate with Iran at all levels, including nuclear energy." The February 18 meeting put the Bushehr plant back on track for completion by 2006. Putin reiterates that he does not believe Tehran intends to develop nuclear weapons.
The Iran Brief reports that, according to US sources, Iran recently procured uranium hexafluoride, commonly known as UF6, from China. UF6 is a gaseous form of uranium used in the enrichment process to produce weapons-grade uranium.
The Iran Daily criticizes the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) "double-standards" two days after its Director-General met with Iran's president in Tehran. The daily cites the IAEA as "a product of the Western system" such as its "covert support for Israel's formidable nuclear weapons program and Washington's irritating charges about Tehran's bid for the bomb." [Note: See 22 July 1997 and 28 July 1997.]
The Iran Daily reports that components destined for the Bushehr nuclear power plant were stolen in Isfahan. Yevgeniy Adamov, the Russian Atomic Energy Minister, believes the equipment does not represent any kind of radiation concern. According to Iranian officials, the truck, which belongs to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), was carrying inconsequential parts destined for tests in Tehran. The AEOI believes the truck, and not the parts, was the target of the theft. [Note: See 17 April 1998 for the first report of the stolen truck.]
After quarterly International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of Iranian nuclear complexes over the past year, IAEA spokesman David Kyd reports that the inspectors "haven't seen anything to indicate" Iran has a nuclear weapons program. According to one US official, "there has been no material breach of the [Nuclear Non-Proliferation] treaty per se." However, Kyd notes, "We don't give the Iranians a clean bill of health; we just haven't seen anything to indicate otherwise." The IAEA intends to implement new, "stronger" inspection measures, called the "93+2" program. Under the new program, the IAEA will ask countries for more detailed nuclear import and export reports and the authorization to install "special monitoring equipment...that would trigger an alarm in Vienna" in case of nuclear activity at a site. The program will be used only at nuclear facilities the IAEA has permission to inspect. Kyd says Iran is expected to accept the new program if it is approved by the Board of Governors and if all other countries are subject to the same safeguards.
The Iran Report reports that a 1997 Georgian state chancellery document reveals that Iran obtained nuclear reactor equipment from Georgia for $36,000. Iran is also reported to be seeking Georgian nuclear scientists for research at Iranian universities, a move made possible by Georgia's foundering economy.
The Iranian ambassador to Russia, Mehdi Safari, says "Tehran will sign no other contracts to build nuclear stations" after the 8 January 1995 contract with Russia to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He says Iran is "firmly opposed to atomic and other destructive weapons," and that its nuclear program is only because of "limited oil resources."
The Iranian chief of the Expediency Council, Rafsanjani, says Iran expects to join the club of nuclear states. Rafsanjani declares that Iran is ready to reassure the world that it is not looking to acquire nuclear weapons, although it is also not willing to give up its legal right to pursue the matter. Iran seeks to restart its enrichment processes within six months.
The Iranian daily newspaper Salam reports that there are 80 nuclear projects underway in Iran "to provide the country's electricity needs by using atomic energy." Some of the projects are believed to be used in the construction of the Bushehr power station and the "Esteqlal [independence] atomic power plant." However, an Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) spokesman claims that the report is incorrect, and that an "Esteqlal atomic power plant" does not exist.
The Iranian daily newspaper Shargh quotes Sirous Nasseri, a member of Iran's nuclear program negotiating team, as stating that Iran has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle since last year.
The Iranian deputy Foreign Minister for Euroamerican Affairs rejects claims that Iran had purchased nuclear weapons from Kazakhstan.
The Iranian embassy in Baku expresses its concern to the Azeri authorities over alleged negotiations to dump of radioactive waste in the Caspian Sea. [Note: See also 24 October 1997.]
After visiting Iran, Russian State Duma Deputy Kurban-Ali Amirov says Iran is unhappy with the progress of construction at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He says the Iranians said Western companies work faster and are more specific about deadlines. He says the Iranians said "it has become hard to have dealings with Russian business."
The Iranian embassy in Georgia issues a statement denying claims by Levan Kidzinidze, former aid to Ajarian leader Aslan Abashidze, that with Abashidze's help, four physicists were sent to Iran in 1995 to help Iran develop nuclear weapon. The statement calls the claims "the figment of a sick imagination." [Note: See also 1995.]
The Iranian embassy in India calls "baseless" reports of nuclear cooperation between Iran and China. "Iran like India is in favor of nuclear disarmament in the world," the statement says. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denies a report in the Washington Times on 16 October that said China was helping Iran build a nuclear reactor as part of a nuclear weapons program.
The Iranian embassy in Moscow denies a Russian media report that Tehran attempted to obtain nuclear weapons-related material.
The Iranian embassy in Moscow denies any knowledge of two institutes alleged to have cooperated with Iran's missile and nuclear weapons programs [presumably the Design Institute of Power Technology and the Moscow Aviation Institute] and says that Iranian students are studying only humanities at Moscow University. [Note: See 12 January 1999.] Moscow University was not mentioned by US National Security Adviser Samuel Berger in his list of entities under sanction. It is unclear if the embassy is referring to another allegation of cooperation that included the University of Moscow or if one of the three entities listed by Berger are affiliated with the university.]
After visiting several nuclear facilities in Iran, two experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency say they witnessed no violations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime. IAEA experts Vlado Valkovich and Frank Watt say the Iranian nuclear program is "entirely for peaceful purpose[s]." Valkovich, a "specialist in precise devices of the IAEA in Australia," claims that Iran has progressed in its use of the Karaj research center's accelerators and cyclotrons.
The Iranian embassy in Yerevan protests US allegations that Armenian entities have transferred nuclear technology to Iran. The embassy claims that not one Armenian-Iranian joint-venture is engaged in developing high military technology.
The Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi visits Russia to meet with Russia Foreign Minister Yevgeniy Primakov, Defense Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin, and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov. Discussion topics include, among other things, Iran's ties with Russia, the crisis in Iraq, and the Russian construction of a nuclear reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. Kharazi also talks to Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov, who indicates that Russia will take over the construction of the Bushehr plant from local companies. This seems to validate claims over the growing problems concerning Bushehr's refurbishment. [Note: See also 2 and 22 February 1998, 16 November 1998, and March 1999.]
The Iranian Foreign Ministry announces that the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is going on as scheduled and the facility will be commissioned on time. Hamid Reza Asefi, a spokesman of the Iran's Foreign Ministry, says that heavy equipment has arrived from Russia and that assembly work is underway in the reactor building of the plant.
The Iranian government decides that by 2005 up to 20% of the energy in Iran will be produced by nuclear electric power and that 10 nuclear units will be built.
The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and other armed forces of Iran stage a "nuclear defense" drill in an abandoned village near Hamadan. The mock war is code-named "ya Fatima a z-Zahra" (invoking prophet Mohammad's daughter Fatima). Local fire fighting and relief personnel practice extinguishing fires and providing medical attention, including giving victims "anti-nuclear baths." This drill occurs on the 10th anniversary of the day Iranian forces "ousted" Iraqi troops from the city of Abadan in southwestern Iran.
The Iranian Majlis (parliament) speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nuri assures visiting Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Adamov that Iran will only use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Nuri says, "It has become clear to the world that Iran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a member of the Nuclear Disarmament Conference, is not after stockpiling nuclear weapons." Nuri also expresses satisfaction with Iranian-Russian relations and states his hope that Russia and Iran expand further their cooperation.
The Iranian newspaper Farda reports that Iran is unhappy with Russian work at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, and that Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, did not accompany Viktor Mikhailov, head of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry, on a recent trip to Bushehr to show disapproval. Mikhailov says there is no delay in construction, but that any Russian worker who causes delay will be fired.
The Iranian newspaper Hayat-e No reports that within the next year, Iranian authorities will permanently evacuate the villages surrounding the uncompleted Bushehr reactors. An unnamed official states, "A team of European experts is at the Bushehr site now to examine the possible effects of radiation" and adds that the two reactors are expected to be operational in 2004.
The Iranian newspaper Ya-Lesarat reports the arrest of two atomic experts suspected of passing nuclear secrets abroad.
The Iranian opposition group Mojahedin-e Khalq says the budget for Iran's nuclear program for 1990-91 is $200 million. The Mojahedin also says that the nuclear weapons program fund is increased to $500 million in 1991. [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
The Iranian parliament has unanimously approved a bill requiring the government to resume uranium enrichment.
The Iranian parliament ratifies nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia and China. Iran will buy two VVER-440s [440MW reactors] from Russia and two 300MWe pressurized water reactors similar to those at Qinshan from China. [Note: See 21 February 1993 entry for the signing of the agreement. See 24 February 1993 for the Iranian president's comments on the agreement. See 13 April 1993 for more on the ratification.]
Agence France Presse reports that Iran has five small reactors at research centers in Tehran and Isfahan. Three of the reactors are Chinese-made.
The Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations releases a press release regarding CIA Chief James Woolsey's 25 January 1994 testimony before the US Congress. The release denies that Iran has a nuclear weapons program and affirms that Iran cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency in regards to inspections, such as the last IAEA visit in November 1993. The release states that Woolsey's remarks about Iran were "self-serving" and were made in the interest of "securing budgetary and otherwise allocations for the current administration" in the United States.
The Iranian press criticizes West Germany refusing to rebuild Bushehr.
The Iranian press says China should have a more firm and clear position on its nuclear cooperation with Iran.
The Isfahan Alloy Steel complex opens as part of a $600 million deal with Danieli Officine Meccaniche of Italy, the Iranian National Steel Company, and Nippon Steel of Japan. [Note: See July 1996.]
A Chinese research reactor begins operation at Isfahan.
The Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center opens. The center includes subcritical mass reactors and neutron production laboratories designed and built by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran for the purpose of gaining the technology to design nuclear reactors. The reactors use natural uranium. The neutron production laboratory has "Kacgraft" and "Walton" neutron-producing equipment. The laboratory is for training the center's staff. The research from the center is planned to be used to build a 27MW reactor in the next two years. [Note: The 27MW reactor proposed for installation at Isfahan by China but never realized should not be confused with a 27kWt Chinese-supplied reactor at Isfahan that went critical March 1994. For entries on the 27kWt reactor, see 1991, September 1991, March 1994, and 7 September 1995. For entries on the 27MW reactor, see 21 January 1990, 14 March 1990, June 1990, November 1991, and 1 June 1995.]
The Islamic Majlis of Iran ratifies bills on cooperation pacts with Russia and China. In July 1989, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi- Rafsanjani signed the 10-point Iran-Russia cooperation pact on peaceful utilization of "nuclear materials and related equipment."
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reports that the Iranian government decided to conclude a "contract for completing the first unit" of its nuclear power plant at Bushehr. Observers said that the contract could be in reference to a statement in October 1997 by the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Commission, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, about Iran's intention to construct a second 1,000MW reactor at Bushehr with Russian assistance. Two Russian reactors have been planned in Iran for several years, but high costs meant that work on only one has begun so far. Aqazadeh also announces that Iran "wants to sign two separate contracts;" one with Russia for two 440MW units, and the other with China for two 300MW units.
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reports Washington and China are working to reach an agreement over nuclear trade between China and Iran. Iran perceives the initiative as a means for the United States to procure substantial funding for reactor sales to China. Iran sees this as hypocritical in light of recent US denouncement of China as a nuclear security risk. Iran Daily states, "After all, it is too naÃ¯ve to trust the promises from a country that is held by the US intelligence agencies as the main culprit behind the global spread of nuclear weapons."
The Islamic Republic News Agency reports that Boris Shikhmyradov, Turkmenistan's Foreign Minister, supports Iran-Russian nuclear cooperation. Shikhmyradov says the relationship between Iran and Russia would be beneficial for Turkmenistan, which he believes is ready "to play the role of transit territory between Russia and Iran."
Agence France Presse reports that Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, says Moscow and Iran have concluded a new nuclear accord that provides for plans to construct a pressurized water research reactor. Mikhailov says, "Moscow has no intention of reducing its cooperation with Iran in the area of the use of civilian nuclear energy and on the contrary will honor inter-governmental accords." Mikhailov says Russia plans to sign a contract by the end of the year to build a 40MW light water research reactor in Iran. Reports also indicate that the Iranian Majlis has allocated $700 million for the first stage of a contract for the construction of the research reactor.
The Islamic Republic News Agency reports that the international mass media believes Iran is trying to obtain nuclear weapons in light of the successful tests in India and Pakistan. In response, Iran states, "It is rational as in the Iraqi crisis for Iran to adopt a rational stance and while stressing its commitment to Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and condemn both sides as being responsible for escalating tension in the region."
The Islamic Republic News Agency reports that West German firm Kraftwerk Union will resume completion of the Bushehr nuclear power plant in the "near future."
The Islamic Republic News Agency says that Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmud Mohammadi says there has been no change in "peaceful nuclear cooperation" between Iran and China. Iranian diplomat Husayn Aminian Tossi says in Beijing that he had seen reports of the cancellation of the deal between Iran and China for two 300MW reactors, but the reports had not been confirmed.
The Islamic Republic News Agency says the vote by the US House of Representatives to cut funding to the International Atomic Energy Agency because of its assistance to Iran "defies all logic," in light of the purported 200 nuclear weapons Israel has in its possession. [Note: See 3 August 1998.] In rebuttal to the US decision, David Kyd, IAEA spokesman, says "This action cannot influence this agency's general policies...All the member states of this agency are satisfied with the peaceful nuclear cooperation between the agency and Iran and the agency will support any peaceful use of nuclear energy in the world."
The Israeli Defense Forces report that Iran might be able to produce a nuclear bomb within a decade.
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports that North Korea is producing enriched uranium and testing long-range missile engines in Iran in exchange for North Korean aid to Iran in these two areas, as well as the concealment of North Korean efforts from the United States and other countries.
The Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres says that Iran has the potential to procure nuclear weapons with four years. Peres: "I believe that in four years, they (Iran) may reach nuclear weapons." Peres further expresses his surprise at Egypt's criticism on Israel's nuclear reactor in Dimona. He says that since Egypt is unable to prevent Iran from acquiring and threatening Israel with weapons of mass destruction, there should be no question of Israel's defensive weapons.
The Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, while in Kiev, is assured that Ukraine is not selling Iran nuclear technology or equipment.
The Italian authorities intercept crates of "ultra-sonic equipment for the testing of nuclear reactors" on a ship believed bound for Iran. The ship carrying the crates is owned by the Milan-based freight forwarder, Rondine, and was stopped due to discrepancies regarding the ship's export licenses.
The Japanese Foreign ministry announces that it will hold bilateral talks with Iran over nuclear nonproliferation on 12 July. This will be the fourth such meeting between the Foreign Ministry director generals of Iran and Japan, and it is to be held in Tehran.
The Japanese Metropolitan Police Department's (MPD) public safety division arrested two former executives of a now defunct Japanese optical equipment manufacturer on the suspicion that the company had exported sensitive equipment to Iran. The company, known as Sunbeam, reportedly illegally sold 3,100 sighting lenses in April and December 1995 to Iran. The sighting lenses can be used with "RPG-7" anti-tank weapons. Similar sighting lenses, also sold by Sunbeam, were found on board a North Korean submarine that ran aground in South Korean waters in September 1996. Japanese officials believe that the sighting lenses were sold to Iran, which in turn supplied them to North Korea in exchange for missile technology. North Korean defectors have reportedly told interrogators, "North Korea has imported Japan's high-tech devices necessary for the development of nuclear weapons and other military equipment through third countries." Japanese officials are concerned that equipment made in Japan and sold illegally by Japanese companies may pose a threat to Japan's security.
The Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun reports that in the past year, Iranian nuclear experts secretly visited North Korea, possibly to receive advice on how to deal with international inspectors. An Iranian official denies the reports and states that no Iranian nuclear officials have visited North Korea.
The Jerusalem Post reports that Chinese leaders have informed Israeli President Ezer Weizman that China will not supply Middle Eastern countries with "weapons that could pose a threat to Israel." The pledge follows Weizman's visit to China, during which he discussed the issue of Chinese missile and nuclear assistance to Iran with Chinese government officials.
The Jerusalem Post reports that Iran received nuclear warheads from a former Soviet republic in the early 1990s, maintained by Russian experts. This information is based on Iranian government documents relayed to Israel and acquired by The Post. These documents contain correspondence between leaders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Iran's government officials that discusses Iran's successful acquisition of nuclear warheads from former Soviet republics. US congressional experts have deemed the documents authentic; Israel is still studying them. The Post notes that these documents appear to support reports from 1992 that Iran received up to four nuclear warheads and enriched uranium from Kazakhstan, with assistance from the Russian underworld. [Note: For more on this topic, see 1995, 10 (2 entries), 11, 15, and 16 April 1998. 1991, 13 October, December, and 27 December 1991 entries may also be related.]
The Jerusalem Post reports that Russia will continue with plans to construct a nuclear power station in Iran, but will require that Iran return spent fuel from the light water reactors it will use in the plant at Bushehr.
The Jerusalem Post reports that the Israeli government is lobbying the US administration to put the Iran-Russia nuclear cooperation at the top of the agenda of the discussion of Presidents Bush and Putin.
The Jerusalem Post reports that top-secret Iranian government documents indicate that Iran paid $25 million for two tactical nuclear weapons smuggled out of Kazakhstan in the early 1990s. An unknown exiled Iranian scientist delivered the documents to Labor MK Rafi Elul. The weapons, delivered to the Lavizan industries in Iran, allegedly were impossible to use due to a safety mechanism on their covers. A source identified as Engineer Turkan in the documents said that the only way to make the weapons operational would be "to bring the experts from the country in which they were produced [to Iran] and to remove the covers." Argentine and Russian technicians reportedly aided the operation; the documents indicate that Turkan deemed the Argentine workers ineffectual and hoped that the Russian experts would "not cause these problems." The US government reportedly has been holding these documents for several years, but believes that the documents are false. [Note: See 9 April 1998 entry that states that the United States confirms the authenticity of the documents.] When asked about claims that Iran acquired nuclear weapons from Kazakhstan, State Department spokesperson James Rubin stated, "There was no evidence to substantiate such claims." Rubin added, "While we remain concerned about Iranian intentions to acquire nuclear weapons capability, we have no information suggesting that Iran is in possession of nuclear warheads acquired from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan."
The Jerusalem Report reports that Iran wants to buy portable uranium-enrichment facilities from South Africa for use in building nuclear weapons. A deal would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Jerusalem Times reports that Iran is trying to purchase nuclear technological information and parts from South Africa's now defunct nuclear weapons program. The Times reports Kamal Kharazi, Iran's Foreign Minister, has traveled to South Africa three times in the last several months to procure items necessary to enhance Iran's growing nuclear program. It is believed that Iran, which did not support South Africa during apartheid, will be embraced by the money-starved South African government.
The Jewish Telegraph Agency reports that a two-year investigation by Britain's MI-5 intelligence agency and its European counterparts has uncovered a sophisticated supply network from Britain through Germany and Austria ending in Iran. It is used to accelerate the Iranian program for producing missiles and nuclear warheads. British customs officials say that Iran planned to use Britain as "a conduit for acquiring high-strength steel of a quality used in missile casing, and centrifuges for weapons-grade uranium." Iranian scientists have already acquired other vital components for their program, disguising some as medical equipment and auto parts. A police raid in Germany uncovered a front company for the Defense Industries Organization, an arm of the Iranian Defense Ministry. German authorities found documents detailing a huge purchasing operation to obtain weapons of mass destruction at the front company. Experts fear that "the technology acquired by the front company will significantly assist the Iranian missile and nuclear programs." British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook says that he doubts if economic sanctions would "have serious effects on Iran's attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction."
The Kazakhstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs denies reports that Kazakhstan planned to sell nuclear ballistic missiles to Iran. Reports that President Nursultan Nazabayev had traveled twice to Iran are also dismissed.
The Khabar-ser vis agency reports that there are ongoing regular unofficial consultations between representatives of the Iranian Nuclear Energy Organization and a group of Armenian nuclear specialists that work at the Metsamorskaya AES nuclear power plant. According to the information available, Iran hopes to acquire nuclear experts as technical consultants about the working of nuclear reactors and the utilization of nuclear energy. Moreover, as Armenia does not have much expertise in nuclear matters, the Armenian power plant may be disguising the leakage of Russian expertise to Iran. [Note: See 22 March 1996.]
The Kolomensky Zavod holding company begins building diesel emergency power plants for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. According to the contract signed by Atomstroyeksport JSC [joint stock company], Iran will get four DGU6200 diesel generator plants, each including two 15-9DG diesel generators, plus one DGU-3100 plant, including one 15-9DG diesel generator. It is not clear if all the plants are destined for Bushehr. The plants, whose generators can each provide 3,100KW of electricity, are for emergency cooling of a nuclear reactor in an emergency, plus emergency power for the nuclear plant. Each diesel generator cost $700,000, and Iran has prepaid $2 million for the order in January 2002. The first diesel plant is to be delivered this year. [Note: See 3 January 2002.]
The London Sunday Telegraph reports that Iran is recruiting top Iran weapons scientists in Iraq and overseas. It states that an Iraqi Islamic militia the pro-Iranian Badr Brigade is helping Iraqi scientists travel across the Iraq-Iran border.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the United States is trying to implement an export policy preventing US exports of dual-use technology to Iran. Iran already has purchased $60 million of high-tech equipment, including powerful computers that may have nuclear applications.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the United States is worried that a $360 million loan provided to Iran by Japan will allow Iran to fund its nuclear weapons program. Japan labels the money as means to "moderating" Iranian activity.
The magazine Al-Watan Al-Arabi reports that Iran purchased three nuclear weapons from a former Soviet republic for an estimated $175 million and hired in excess of 50 Soviet nuclear experts at salaries comparable to $5,800 a month to assemble the purchased bomb components. Kazakhstan is alleged to be the supplier in this deal because it is the only former Soviet republic known to have nuclear weapons.[Note: for earlier reports on this see 13 October and December 1991.]
The manager for technical service of nuclear power plants for the Czech firm Skoda Plzen, Frantisek Svitak, says that Iran wishes to build a nuclear power plant and that Skoda could provide it with reactor equipment through a Russian general supplier.
The Middle East Economic Digest reports that senior Russian officials say Russia will continue its relationship with Iran over nuclear reactors in Iran despite threats by the United States to halt economic aid to Russia. Sergei Karaganov, a member of the Russian Presidential Council, says the West need not be worried by the sale of a nuclear reactor to Iran, which is something that can not be connected to arms manufacture.
The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin reports that Iran's civilian and military nuclear programs are headquartered in Tehran. The Tehran Nuclear Research Center has a 5MW nuclear research reactor. It also has a uranium yellowcake production facility. Tehran also hosts the AEOI center for Theoretical Physics and Mathematics, which carries out research on nuclear physics and plasma physics.
The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin reports that Isfahan is believed to be the center of the Iranian nuclear weapons program. The Nuclear Technology Research Center at the University of Isfahan allegedly employs 3,000 scientists. Isfahan is also home of a 27KW Chinese-supplied miniaturized neutron source reactor.
The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin reports that Neka is allegedly a nuclear facility near the Caspian Sea. Reports claim that it is an underground facility.
The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin reports that the facility of Chalus is located 20 kilometers south of the town bearing the same name. It is allegedly an underground nuclear weapons development facility built in the Alborz mountains. Iranian authorities tell their citizens that the facility is an electricity generation plant operated by Canadians.
The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin reports that the location of the Rudan Nuclear Research Center is near the city of Shiraz. The facility is believed to focus on uranium yellowcake processing into uranium hexafluoride gas.
The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin reports that the Nuclear Research Center for Agriculture and Medicine is located in Karaj. The center reportedly has a radiochemistry lab, dosimeter lab, a Chinese calutron and a Belgian cyclotron.
The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin reports that the Nuclear Research Department at the University of Yazd carries out geological research and mining in the Saghand uranium deposits. The deposits are believed to contain 5,000 tons of uranium oxide with a U-235 content between 0.08% and 1.0%.
The Middle East Newsline reports that Iran and Russia are believed to be in disagreement about tighter International Atomic Energy Agency inspections to nuclear sites in Iran. Iran opposes the Russian proposal for tighter inspections. Russia is trying to ensure that Iran cannot use the Russian built facilities to produce nuclear weapons. Iranian officials have not signed a protocol that will allow a more comprehensive inspection of nuclear site that will unveil if a facility has any secret activities. [Note: See 28 July 1997 and 1 June 2000 for more on Iran and the Additional Protocol.]
The Middle East Newsline reports that Iran is preparing to receive a light water nuclear reactor from Russia. Work on the reactor had been completed at Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg. The VVER-type reactor, which was built in three years, weighs 317 tons and will be assembled upon its arrival to Bushehr in about a month. The nuclear reactor is scheduled to be operational in 2003. This reactor is part of an $800 million contract Russia and Iran signed in 1995.
The Middle East Newsline reports that Russia plans to start operating the first unit of the Iran nuclear power plant by the end of 2003.
The Middle East Newsline reports that Russian and Iranian officials cannot agree on the transfer of at least three additional nuclear reactors and other nuclear technology. Western diplomatic sources believe that this disagreement stands behind the delay of the visit of Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharazi to Moscow. Russian officials confirmed that Mr. Kharazi did not arrive in Moscow amid disagreement over some issues. Iran has complained after Russia decided to postpone the completion of the Bushehr nuclear reactor to 2005 instead of 2003 as initially agreed upon. Yet, Victor Kozlov, director-general of Atomstroyesksport, the company building the Bushehr nuclear reactor, says that his company has sent a feasibility study for new nuclear reactors in Iran.
The Muslim of Islamabad reports that, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has "undeclared nuclear facilities" and "hidden quantities" of nuclear material. The report says Pakistan has supplied uranium enrichment equipment, which was originally received from Germany, to Iran and North Korea.
Akbar Torkan, former Iranian defense minister, says, "Can our Air Force...take on the Americans, or our Navy take on the American Navy? If we put all our country's budget into such a war, we would have just burned our money. The way to go about dealing with such a threat requires a different solution entirely."
The National Council of Resistance to Iran (NCRI) opposition group has raised suspicions regarding two covert Iranian military sites where nuclear activities may be taking place, sparking IAEA's interest to inspect the sites. UN diplomats state that the IAEA lacks the legal authority to search these sites as they may only monitor civilian nuclear programs, and the facilities in question were never declared as nuclear sites.
The National Post of Toronto reports that the United States is concerned over the possible sale of Canadian fusion technology and a tokamak fusion reactor to Iran. There is a possibility that this may constitute the sale of sensitive or dual-use technology. The Nuclear Control Institute, based in Washington, DC, says that even though Iran has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran might use the reactor to obtain weapons-grade plutonium. According to an unnamed senior US government official, Canadian officials in the Export Control division at the Foreign Affairs Ministry have assured the United States that Canada will not permit the export of fusion technology and the tokamak reactor to Iran. [Note: See 12, 14 July 1999.]
The Natural Resources Defense Council discloses details of the secret protocol between Russia and Iran, which calls for 10 to 20 Iranian nuclear technicians to be trained in Russia each year.
The new Russian ambassador to Iran, Aleksandr Maryasov, denies that Russia is helping Iran acquire nuclear weapons. "What America and Israel are alleging is not true since we have never cooperated in the production of nuclear arms," he says. "These countries are only making baseless allegations. We should ignore these allegations,"
The New York Times report that US analysts insist that Iran has neither the money nor the professional personnel to produce a nuclear weapon in a short time. One expert said that China might assist Iran in nuclear weapons development, but that such assistance "will certainly not be on the scale of Western help to Iraq."
The New York Times reports an Iranian truck with a cargo of radioactive material was seized at the border of Uzbekistan. It is uncertain whether the material could be used to make a nuclear weapon. The truck is not the first to be intercepted at the border, the report says, but American intelligence agencies believe no weapons-grade nuclear material has made it through.
The New York Times reports that a CIA draft report concludes that Iran is making progress on its nuclear arms program and could develop a weapon by 2000. The highly technical report however is contentious as intelligence experts are divided on the meaning of Iran's $2 billion annual buildup.
The New York Times reports that some US defense officials believe the Bushehr nuclear power plant should be destroyed before it goes into operation in the next 34 months. The report also mentions that Israel has said it would not allow the plant to open. An editorial in the state-run Tehran Times, states, "Iran will definitely not sit by idly if its nuclear installations are attacked. It is a matter of national pride and security."
The New York Times reports that the United States has been pressing Russia not to proceed with plans to sell Iran laser technology. US officials say that this technology can be used to make nuclear weapons.Since July, US President Bill Clinton has raised the prospective sale of laser technology at least two times in meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin toldClinton that Russia would work with Washington to resolve the issue. Officials said it was scheduled to be discussed over the weekend by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and RussianAtomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency. US officials said they were encouraged by Putin's statement but they also called the response ambiguous, due to the dual-use nature of the laser technology. The US administration complained about the possible sale of laser equipment after a US corporate nuclear fuel provider abandoned the project, deciding that it was not economically competitive in a civilian nuclear program. TheUnited States apparently believes that the technology is too expensive for refining nuclear fuel for commercial use, and is mostly suited to producing fissile material for bombs. A USadministration nuclear expert said he believes that the USteam of experts had made a "very persuasive technical case"and that the equipment the Russian institute is trying to sell Iran could not be used efficiently for other than military purposes. "I cannot conceive of this type of equipment being used for any other purpose other than the one we are concerned about," the official said. Boris Yatsenko, director of the Science and Technology Center of Microtechnology, a unit of the Russian government's D.V. Efremow Institute of St.Petersburg, in an email sent to the <I>New York Times</I>,said his institute was planning to sell the equipment, which he said was solely for "medical, industrial, and scientific purposes." He said that the average power of the laser would be 15-20W. The American expert said that according to the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the threshold for the type of "copper vapor" laser the institute is planning to sell Iran is 40W.While the institute's lasers are less powerful than the suppliers group threshold, "they can still be of concern," he added. "It depends on how Iran is planning to use them, on what other equipment Russian is selling, and what the entire system looks like." Yatsenko also stated, "Our scientists and technicians will execute maintenance and guarantee support of the deliverable equipment during agreed periods." He also made it clear that the organization did not need the government's approval because he stated that the equipment was purely for nonmilitary purposes.
Akram Zaki, chairman of Pakistan's Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, tells the Middle East Institute that Pakistan would not give, nor has it ever given, sensitive nuclear information or technology to other countries. Pakistan is neither aware of, nor party to, Iran's interest in the nuclear field, he says.
A Chinese-supplied 27kWt miniature neutron source reactor at the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center goes critical. [Note: This reactor should not be confused with a 27MW reactor also proposed for sale by China for installation at Isfahan. See 21 January 1990, 14 March 1990, June 1990, November 1991, and 1 June 1995 for entries on the 27 MW reactor.]
The New York Times reports that the US Clinton administration next week will transmit formal certification of China's nonproliferation credentials in a statement to Congress. The certification will include China's assurances that it has halted assistance to Pakistan or any other country that is seeking to develop nuclear weapons; is ceasing its nuclear power projects with Iran, including the construction of a uranium conversion facility; and is establishing a system of export controls. If Congress neither overturns the certification nor passes new legislation regarding the certification, then it will take effect 30 days after Congress reconvenes in 1998.
The New York Times reports that under the agreement reached earlier this month by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and US Vice President Al Gore, a new commission of experts will be formed to discuss and monitor the export of sensitive nuclear and missile related technology. Chernomyrdin also reaffirms an earlier Russian pledge to have no further nuclear cooperation with Iran while work is continuing on the current nuclear reactor. How this pledge will affect future cooperation has not been announced.
The New York Times reports that, according to Western intelligence officials, Iran uses dozens of locations in Europe to smuggle nuclear weapons-related technology into Iran. Iran seeks to obtain equipment from several sources, and then dismantles it into small pieces to be shipped on different circuitous routes to Iran. Iran uses small aircraft to ship parts to Poland and other Eastern European countries, sometimes via Vienna or Brussels, to be trucked to cargo ships or put on cargo planes to Iran. Pakistan and Syria also reportedly receive items to transship to the Iranian nuclear program. The officials indicate that Iran uses many of the same smuggling routes and contacts that Pakistan and Iraq used to develop their nuclear weapons programs. Intelligence officials believe the small Hartenholm airport, located north of Hamburg in Germany, is used by its Iranian owners as part of this Iranian nuclear smuggling network [Note: See 1993 entry.]
The New York Times reports there is no firm evidence indicating that Iran, Jordan, or Lebanon has attempted to acquire weapons grade nuclear material.
The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) praises Iran's efforts in complying with IAEA requests, and encourages Iran to continue handling the matter "with full transparency" in an IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna. The NAM also reiterates that member states have "basic an inalienable rights to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes."
The Nuclear Research Center for Agriculture and Medicine in Karaj starts a three-week "regional training course" on "non-destructive nuclear testing." Officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency attend the course. Mohammad Haji, deputy of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran for safety system, says, "The purpose of the training course is to upgrade the scientific know-how and standardization of quality control in industries that need to conduct nuclear tests." Such industries include oil, petrochemicals, shipping, and airplane manufacturing, he says.
The Observer of London reports that intelligence agencies have "uncovered" a clandestine attempt by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to procure nuclear weapon technology from British firms. The accused, Husayn Jafari, an Iranian-born businessman who is based in Glasgow, is involved in a disparate number of interests. He recently attempted to procure a spectrometer, only seven of which exist in the world. The spectrometer is primarily used in nuclear weapons research to analyze whether uranium is sufficiently enriched, and is purported to be worth 700,000 Pounds Sterling. Export of the item in question, a Model 54 "mass spectrometer," is strictly regulated by the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr. Jafari has approached VG Elemental, one of four British manufacturers of the spectrometer, and was also seen meeting with Iranian "nuclear procurement experts" in Istanbul, Turkey. According to the newspaper, Jafari met an Iranian delegation at the hotel, among which reportedly was Sayyid Musavi, vice president of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization. The paper also writes that according to a letter written to Musavi, Jafari had offered to supply the spectrometer to Iran for $3 million.
Al Ahram of Cairo reports Iran has bought five tactical nuclear missiles from Kazakhstan. [Note: Later reports say only three missiles were involved and that the warheads came from the Semipalatinsk complex. Note: See December 1991.]
The Orange County Register reports that more that 300 export licenses for computers to be sent to Iran have been granted by the United States, for a total value of $138 million, including a license for a $130,000 oscilloscope. [Note: See 29 August 1991.]
The Persian daily newspaper Kar-v a-Kargar states that Iran needs a nuclear capacity to protect its national security: "Considering the nuclear capability of India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and the Zionist regime (Israel), Iran's geopolitical situation demands a revision in this regard." Iran continues to deny accusations that it seeks weapons of mass destruction and maintains that it possesses a peaceful nuclear program that is open to inspection.
The possible presence of a German scientist in Tehran alarms the international community. He is a scientist who has been charged with supplying valuable and up-to-date information and equipment to the Iraqi government.
The PPNN Newsbrief reports that Argentina may have to revise its contracts for delivery of 20% enriched uranium for the research reactors it has supplied to Algeria, Iran, and Peru, due to delays in production at the Pilcanyeu enrichment plant.
The press secretary of the Iranian embassy in Azerbaijan, Ezzatollah Jalalim denies Iran has nuclear weapons, saying, "Tehran has never and will never try to acquire nuclear weapons from other countries as Iran itself is capable of solving this problem relying on its own resources if the need should arise."
The reactor at Iran's Nuclear Research Center acquires "critical assembly capability." A reports says this suggests that Iran, a state with little nuclear technology of its own, received assistance from Russia or Pakistan or both.
Albert Chernishev, Russian deputy foreign minister, says in an interview that the construction on the Bushehr nuclear power plant continues successfully and in accordance with the norms and guidelines imposed by the international system and the strict control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He adds that allegations of Russia helping Iran acquire nuclear weapons are unfounded because Russia does not want another neighbor with nuclear weapons.
The reactor equipment for the Bushehr nuclear power plant is 90% complete, says the public relations service of Izhorskiye Zavody of St. Petersburg, where it is being built. The equipment for the first unit of the plant will be sent to Iran in the third quarter of the year, the service says. The four casings for the steam generators and the "entire set of collectors" are complete. "The electrical equipment, the embedded fittings, and the mountings for the circulating pump" are being prepared for shipment. The reactor housing and "the set of devices to fit inside the housing are at various stages of completion." The "dry shielding and the reactor truss" will be sent to Iran in the second quarter of the year.
The Russian "right-wing" daily paper Segodnya publishes a "high-level leaked document" that includes plans for aggressive reactions to NATO expansion, including the threat to sell nuclear weapons to Iran and Iraq.
The Russian ambassador to Iran, Sergey M. Tretyakov, says Iran must pay 10% of the $1 billion Bushehr deal by the end of the year. "This is not a credit deal but a cash deal," Tretyakov says. "If the Iranians pay 10%, we will deliver 10% of the nuclear power plant." He says about 150 Russian scientists are doing feasibility studies at the site of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. "It's a more difficult project because we have to finish the project on the basis of Germans," he says, referring to the German contractor that halted work on the plant in 1979.
The Russian Ambassador to Iran, Sergey Tetryakov, says that the according to the bilateral cooperation for nuclear energy, Russia and Iran are not limited to the Bushehr nuclear power station. He adds that Russia could help Iran build more power stations once it completes Bushehr.
The Russian ambassador to Iran, Sergey Tretyakov, says "we are convinced that Iran has no ambitions in the nuclear field." "Even if they had, I think it would take them 50 years," he says.
The Russian ambassador to Iran, Sergey Tretyakov, says financing problems may delay the start of construction on the Bushehr nuclear power plant. "The Russian side," he says, "confirmed Moscow's political will for cooperation with Iran in the area of nuclear energetics when Russian Deputy Premier Aleksey Bolshakov was on his recent visit in Iran and conducted negotiations with Reza Amrollahi, president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran." He says, however, "the financial problems that emerged are a hindrance to the implementation of the agreements reached." After the visit, Iran gave Russia documents to open bills of credit, he says. Iran is to pay Russia $20 million for completed survey and design work and open bills of credit worth $60 million. "The Russian side could not work without funds," Tretyakov says. "Bills of credit and ready money are different things." [Note: See 22 November 1995 for his statement that the financing problems are solved.]
The Russian ambassador to the United States, Yuliy Vorontsov, says Russia will most likely not sell uranium-enriching centrifuges to Iran, nor will it train Iranian nuclear scientists. He says such a deal could be seen as a "military program" contrary to Russian policy. According to Vorontsov, the deal was not authorized by the Kremlin, but rather was set up by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. By cancelling these portions of Russia's nuclear deal with Iran, the $1 billion deal will lose half of its value, he says. The sales of the light water reactors to Iran, however, are "intended for peaceful purposes," he says. "I have repeatedly told the Americans, pay us $500 million and we will cancel the supplies of light water reactors to Iran," he says. "They only smiled." [See 4 and 5 May 1995.]
The Russian and Iranian contract on the Bushehr power plant goes into effect. Russia is under a contractual obligation to complete and render operational the Bushehr nuclear power plant within 55 months.
The Russian Atomic Ministry declares that Russia and Iran are increasing their nuclear cooperation. Russian Minister of Atomic Energy meets with Gholam Reza Agazadeh, Iranian Vice President and head of the Atomic Energy Organization. They both agree to stick to the plan and bring Bushehr's first block 1000MW unit online in December 2003. Russia is also considering potential orders for several more Iranian reactors as part of a ten year plan to provide Iran with 6000MW of nuclear power. Mr. Rumyantsev says that "Russia is extremely interested in discussing such a project."
The Russian Atomstroyeksport company says that Iran and Russia are exploring further nuclear cooperation. Iran proposes that Russia starts the construction of a third unit in Bushehr.
The Russian company Atomstroiexport announces that it has begun technical studies on the construction of a second unit at Bushehr.
Albert Chernishev, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, says that there exist other projects for the cooperation between Russia and Iran for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Bushehr. He also adds that the power plant in Bushehr will not create the possibility for Iran's use of it for military purposes and that the agreement between the two countries provides for reactors that do not produce plutonium that can be used for weapons.
The Russian Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety (Gosatomnadzor) says it will work with Iran to ensure that the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran is constructed safely, a fact necessitated by Iran's lack of experts in this field. The report by Gosatomnadzor further alludes that the Kharkov-based company Turboatom will provide Bushehr's turbine.
The Russian Federal Nuclear Center in Snezhinsk makes public that it has developed a technique using environmental monitoring that can expose clandestine nuclear weapons manufacturing around the world. According to Snezhinsk nuclear scientists, the new method has a "100% certainty of detection," and allows them to "distinguish between peaceful and military activities." The new technique will reportedly help identify whether or not countries like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea maintain undeclared nuclear weapons programs.
The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) detains an Iranian citizen attempting to buy dual-use technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. [Note: The November 1997 and 14 November 1997 entries may refer to the same arrest.]
The Russian Federation ambassador to Iran, Aleksandr Maryasov, says Russia is against "politicizing Iran's nuclear case" through bullying or undiplomatic methods. Maryasov also states that the first phase of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, for which Russia is providing assistance, is almost complete and equipment is being installed.
The Russian Federation's permanent representative to the United Nations rejects reports that a former Soviet Republic, a Muslim state, sold three tactical nuclear weapons to Iran. Iran reportedly paid between $130 to $150 million dollars for the bombs in question. Russian President Boris Yeltsin also denies the reports, saying that all nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union are under control. [Note: This probably refers to reports that Iran bought nuclear weapons from Kazakhstan.]
The Russian Foreign Ministry states that the first phase of the construction of the Bushehr reactor will be completed in May 2003. This statement comes after a visit to Tehran by Russian Atomic Energy Minister Adamov.
The Russian government denies US allegations that Russia and China have provided Iran with information on how to develop long-range missiles that can carry nuclear warheads.
The Russian government vows to resume its nuclear assistance to Iran even if the latter rejects the tougher inspection regime that US demands. Dmitry Rogozin, chairman of the Duma's committee on international affairs, tells reporters in an interview, "We genuinely do not understand what the Americans want from us....We are not so insane as to set up a time bomb under our own chairs."
The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy agrees during a meeting with officials from the US Department of State that Russia will make the sale of pressurized water reactors to Iran conditional upon Iran's acceptance of additional safeguard measures. According to Russian officials, their government also accepted a US request that Russia refrain from supplying Iran with any reprocessing or enrichment technology or equipment. However, Russia did not state that it would honor a further US request that Russia accept the return of spent fuel from Iran.
The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and other Russian research centers, India's Institute for Plasma Studies, China's National Nuclear Corporation, and Iran's nuclear power industry form the Asian Foundation for Thermonuclear Studies, pursuant to an agreement reached in Moscow to create the foundation would pool the four countries' nuclear expertise to work on controlled thermonuclear fission. [Note: The foundation is also called the Asian Fusion Research Foundation. See 29 February and 4 March 1996.]
The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy issues a statement that it plans to establish a managerial office in Tehran and that currently 150 Russian specialists are working at the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Aleksander Rumyantsev, Russian Atomic Energy Minister, responds to a statement of an US official that the United States would not object to the construction of single nuclear reactor in Iran, he says that he is glad about the "favorable shift" in US attitude.
The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy reports it will build three more nuclear reactors for Iran. The three reactors consist of one light water VVER-1000 [1000MW] reactor and two VVER-440 [440MW light water] reactors, all of which would be built at Bushehr. A spokesman for the ministry says it has made further plans with Iran to construct a desalting installation with a nuclear reactor. Iran continues to refute claims by Western nations that Iran is striving to produce nuclear weapons. In particular Iran denies claims made by Aleksei Yablokov, a Russian government ecological safety officer, that Iran could use Russian-made reactors to produce a nuclear bomb.
The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy says it will increase cooperation with countries wishing to pursue civilian-use nuclear technology. "This fully applies to Iran as well," reports Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov. Mikhailov says his country's relationship with Ukraine regarding nuclear cooperation in civilian-use technology is "satisfactory."
The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy will not cease work on the Bushehr nuclear power plant while the deal is reviewed by the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, says ministry spokesman Georgiy Kaurov. [See 11 May 1995 for more information on the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission.] The commission "will thoroughly analyze the contract details and not find a single rotten thing in it," Kaurov says. "The contract on the construction of a nuclear power plant in Iran does not violate either international or Russian-US agreements."
The Russian-Iranian intergovernmental commission on economic cooperation comes to a tentative agreement during its second session regarding the construction of a third and fourth nuclear power station. Vladimir Bulgak, the Russian deputy prime minister, reasserts that Iran's nuclear transparency is intact, noting its membership in the International Atomic Energy Agency and its status as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The San Francisco Chronicle reports that Iran acknowledged buying nuclear technology and equipment from China but claims it was for peaceful purposes. Iran also says China had accepted International Atomic Energy Agency restrictions on the sale of nuclear technology to other countries. China has sold nuclear technology to Algeria, Iraq, and Pakistan, which is also reported to have a nuclear weapons program. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said he had no details on Chinese-Iranian nuclear cooperation, but he said that all nuclear cooperation programs must be for peaceful purposes only, that installations must be open to international inspections, and that the recipient could not transfer any unpacked technology without China's permission.
The Second International Machine-Tool, Construction Equipment, and Heavy Machinery Fair is held in Iran. Iranian Commerce Minister Yahya Al-e Ishaq, speaking at the opening ceremonies, says that despite US sanctions, Iran is currently exporting industrial technology and equipment, and that they have been able to secure overseas markets in both Africa and Central Asia. Companies from Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Britain took part in the fair.
The secretary general of the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, Mostafa Hijri, says that Iran intends to develop its own nuclear arms.
The Slovak economic minister, Jan Ducky, says that the Slovak Republic is incapable participating in the construction of a new power station in Iran. The economy minister says this in response to a report that Slovakia and Russia will cooperate in building a nuclear power station for Iran.
The South African Press Association (SAPA) reports that Dr. Waldo Stumpf, South Africa's Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC) chief, has denied that Iran attempted to buy nuclear weapons technologies from South Africa last year. He further denies the report made by Jane's Defense Weekly that claims he and Reza Amrollahi, Iran's Deputy Minister for Atomic Affairs, met to discuss nuclear technology issues.
The Soviet Union and Iran sign a protocol under which the Soviet Union will build two VVER 440 reactors in Iran in return for three billion cubic meters of natural gas. The countries also agree to cooperate in nuclear research for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union will also complete the two 1293MW pressurized water reactors at Bushehr that Siemens-Kraftwerk Union of West Germany has refused to finish until the Iran-Iraq War is formally ended. [Note: The 1293MW reactor under construction at Bushehr is also referred to as 1200MWe. See November 1974, May 1987, and March 1993.]
The Spanish newspaper El Pais reports that Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati asked the E.U. to "give the necessary cooperation for Iran to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes." In exchange, Velayati promised that Iran would "initiate serious cooperation against terrorism."
Aleksander Rumyantsev, the Russian Atomic Energy Minister, says "that when we supply Iran with fresh fuel within three years [from now]...it will be returned to Russia again." [Note: Rumyantsev seems to be saying that Russia will begin sending nuclear fuel to Iran within three years, and that it will be returned to Russia as spent fuel.]
The spokesman at the Iranian embassy in India denies that Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati discussed a 10MW reactor on his recent trip to India. An Indian official says India and Iran had "preliminary discussions" last year about the reactor. The Iranian official also says, "Iran has enough money to buy a nuclear reactor from anywhere in the world. We need a large number of reactors for our power industry and we have the money to buy them."
The Sunday Telegraph of London reports that China has installed a calutron system for enriching uranium at a nuclear research facility at Karaj, about 100 miles northwest of Tehran. This technology is similar to that used by Iraq to make weapons-grade uranium.
The Sunday Telegraph of London reports that for over one year, Austrian nuclear scientists have been working on a cyclotron for enriching uranium at Iran's nuclear research facility in Karaj. Austria clandestinely sold Iran the cyclotron as "medical equipment." Tehran has a variety of "front companies" in Vienna that are used to purchase nuclear weapons technologies. This Austrian technology is more sophisticated than what Iran receives from China or North Korea, and could facilitate the production of weapons-grade uranium "within a few years." [Note: The Sunday Telegraph reports having received the information about the Austrian connection from unnamed "documents" from an unnamed source.]
The Sunday Telegraph of London reports that, according to nuclear specialists, Iran could acquire a nuclear weapon by 2001. The report says Iran has several "top-secret" nuclear facilities that are not safeguarded, the largest being an underground nuclear facility at Isfahan. According to the report, other clandestine Iranian nuclear installations are the Neka nuclear facility, built near the Caspian Sea, and a nuclear facility at Darkhovin, run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. In early 1996, Israel planned pre-emptive air strikes against these nuclear installations but was convinced not to by the United States, the report says. Iran's official nuclear research headquarters is located in Tehran.
The Sunday Telegraph reports that Viktor Mikhailov, Russian Atomic Energy Minister, was criticized by "many top brass in Moscow" for negotiating the sale of nuclear technology to Iran. According to a senior defense official, Mikhailov is "a law unto himself and not even the President can control him." Despite Foreign Ministry support for Mikhailov's view that the agreement with Iran is "purely [a] commercial deal," Russian military officers disapprove of Mikhailov's efforts. These military officers fear Russian nuclear deals with Iran may contribute to an Iranian nuclear weapons program. With the Russian military stretched thin battling internal strife, Russian military officials are concerned about the prospects of a nuclear-armed Iran, saying, "That's all we need--mad mullahs with nukes." However, Russian concerns about NATO expansion and about appearing to yield to US pressure strengthened the pro-deal faction's position within the Russian Defense Ministry, the Sunday Telegraph reports.
The Sunday Times of London reports China will go ahead with a deal to provide Iran with uranium processing technology used for making nuclear weapons. The announcement comes despite a recent agreement between the United States and China over cancellation of the Chinese sale of two 300MW nuclear reactors to Iran. [Note: See 27 September and 2 October 1995 for US statements that China cancelled the deal.] Leonard Spector, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, says that Iran's desire to have a uranium hexafluoride plant may mean Iran is moving towards building a nuclear weapon. The plant in question can be used to convert uranium into metal or gas that in turn could be enriched to make either fuel for nuclear weapons or to power reactors. Spector notes that Iran is likely to state it is using the converted uranium to power reactors, but "it would be totally uneconomic to use it to feed power plants, so you have to say what else would they want it for." International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, experts say, only provide a modicum of protection against misuse of nuclear technology, citing the agency's frequent visits to Iraq that did not prevent Saddam Hussein from developing a nuclear weapons program.
The Sunday Times of London reports that, according to Israeli intelligence sources, Iran is recruiting nuclear scientists employed during the apartheid era in South Africa. An unidentified South African government spokesman says that "there may well be nuclear experts who have been made redundant in South Africa and who are willing to give their skills to any country prepared to pay."
The Sunday Times of London reports that, according to US intelligence sources, Iran may be seeking nuclear information and assistance from South Africa. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) says a delegation of South Africans led by Pik Botha, South Africa's Energy Minister, visited Tehran in March, and Iran is believed to have asked about establishing a relationship between the two nations to provide Iran with nuclear technology. South Africa's now defunct nuclear program is reported to have produced at least six nuclear weapons, and its now unemployed nuclear scientists may find Iran to be financially attractive. The Sunday Times reports South Africa has continued to seek new arenas of profit to halt its financial downturn and has aggressively pursued the export of munitions and small arms.
The Sunday Times of London reports the Iran is offering Russian ÃmigrÃs in Israel thousands of dollars a month and luxury housing to continue nuclear research programs in Iran.
The Sunday Times reports that the Russian Research and Planning Institute for Power Supply Technologies (NIKIET) is training a handful of Iranian engineers in technologies that can be used for the production of nuclear weapons.
Aleksandr Losyukov, deputy Russian foreign minister, says the United States should not pressure Russia against helping Iran build the Bushehr nuclear power plant. "We have very clear instructions from the Russian leadership," he says, "to conduct cooperation within the framework of the existing international restricting regimes....One should have no ground to object against our contacts with Iran either in the political or trade and economic spheres."
A CIA and US Congressional assessment estimate that there is a "high degree of certainty that the government of Iran has acquired all or virtually all of the components required for the construction of two to three nuclear weapons."
The Sunday Times reports that two North Koreans in possession of diplomatic passports were detained in Macau carrying $180,000 in counterfeit US bills. According to sources in the US Secret Service, North Korea may have agreed to accept high payments made in fake dollars for the sale of nuclear technology to Iran. In 1989 Iran and North Korea reached an agreement on "economic, scientific and technological cooperation" and on "exchanges of military and science information," which opened channels for trade in nuclear technology.
The Tajikistan parliament acknowledges that negotiations are underway with Iranian representatives for the sale of enriched uranium and uranium production technology. Joint uranium production and enrichment efforts between Tajikistan and Iran are being considered.
The Tehran press reports Iran has cancelled an agreement with China to build a nuclear power plant in Bushehr. US accusations that Iran is attempting to build weapons of mass destruction may have propelled China to change its mind, Tehran reports. A similar agreement between the Ukraine and Iran was terminated under US pressure in 1998. Iran announces it will end its nuclear cooperation with China for "political reasons" and not due to pressure from the United States on China. The joint Russian-Iranian nuclear power plant project in Bushehr Iran is said to be for peaceful purposes and falls under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The Tehran Times, without attributing a source, denies claims by US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Sen. Jesse Helms that China has sold Iran dual-use technology that could be used to make nuclear arms.
The Telegraph of London reports the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) believes Iran's nuclear weapons capability is advancing at a rapid pace, sufficiently enough to allow Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching London or New York within the next decade. The CIA lists Iran as one of five countries that pose a risk to international security. Norman Schindler, Deputy Director of the CIA, says "Iran is attempting to develop the capability to produce both plutonium and highly enriched uranium, and it is actively pursuing the acquisition of fissile material and the expertise and technology necessary to form the material into nuclear weapons."
The third Iran-Russia roundtable discussions are to be held in Tehran. [Note: The second discussions held in Moscow in late 1996 dealt with the promotion of ties between the two countries, strategic as well as nuclear cooperation as well as the positions of the West.]
The Times of London reports Israel's recent procurement of 25 F-15I fighter planes from the United States signals the probability that Israel could respond to an alleged nuclear threat from Iran in the same fashion as it did against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981, which was destroyed in a air strike by Israeli fighters. Yitzhak Mordechai, Israel's Defense Minister, states "The other side must know that Israel will not take it lightly if someone targets us with long-range missiles and threatens our population." Mordechai further states that if Iran's nuclear program continues to go unchecked by the international community Iran will become a nuclear power by 2005.
The Times of London reports that an Iranian opposition official has said that Russia is assisting Iran with the construction of two 440MW nuclear reactors at Gorgan. The Iranian opposition leader also declared that China is prepared to assist Iran in constructing two 300MW nuclear reactors at the Darkhovin facility.
The Times of London reports that the US State Department has asked India not to sell Iran a nuclear research reactor.
The Times of London reports that US intelligence discovered Iran and China have discussed a deal that would provide Iran with hundreds of tons of nuclear material. The report comes only several weeks after the Clinton administration and China reached an agreement halting any transfer of nuclear technology. Further talks between the US Department of State and China reveal China has reaffirmed its agreement to not supply Iran with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, used in enriching uranium. [Note: See 13 March 1998 for a Washington Times report that China is continuing nuclear cooperation with Iran.]
The Turboatom company in Kharkov, Ukraine agrees to develop a slow-rotation turbine for Iran's nuclear power plant in Bushehr. The turbine operates at 1,500 rotations per minute, and is considered safer and less expensive than a fast-rotating turbine. [Note: Ukraine had previously decided not to sell Iran turbines. See 16 April 1997.]
Aleksei Yablokov, chairman of the Security Council commission for ecological security, says that Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Viktor Mikhailov signed a protocol with Iran "which said that contracts will be written for the training of nuclear physicists for Iran and for the construction of a centrifuge plant."
The U.S. Congress has 30 days to object to a Pentagon plan to sell 100 "bunker-buster" bombs to Israel - 5,000l b GBU-28 bombs originally developed to obliterate Saddam Hussein's command centers in the 1991 Gulf War. The proposal is widely seen as a "message" to Iran.
The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee launches a "preemptive" examination of U.S. intelligence on Iran "so that you don't get stuck with a situation like you did with Iraq," says Senator Pat Roberts. A recent CIA report concludes that Tehran is "vigorously pursuing programs to produce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons."
The United Arab Emirates foreign ministry acting undersecretary expresses his country's concern over Iran's alleged attempt to procure nuclear weapons.
The United Arab Emirates gives the United States a list of 15 steps the country is taking to prevent Iran from getting weapons of mass destruction.
The United States accuses Russia of initiating talks with Iran about the sale of weapons-grade uranium to Iran, despite assurances from Russia that it has no plans to provide Iran with uranium for nuclear weapons manufacture. Viktor Mikhailov, the Russian minister of atomic energy, is reported to be responsible for starting the rumor of a uranium sale to Iran, an admission Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's Foreign Minister, says was not within the purview of Mikhailov to make. Russia asserts it will not "back down" to US pressure to end its dealing with Iran in the field of nuclear technology, though it provides assurance that no uranium deal will be made. US pressure includes Russia's exemption from a deal that will provide Russia with a share of $4.5 billion US-North Korea nuclear deal.
The United States acknowledges that Russia has started efforts to stop the transfer of nuclear technology to Iran. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher says that the Russians have punished entities involved in illicit activities with Iran.
The United States and the European troika of Germany, France, and Great Britain apparently agree that it is not clear whether Iran has fully responded to the requests of IAEA chief ElBaradei, suggesting that despite Iran's statement regarding temporary cessation of uranium enrichment activity, its definition of enrichment may be too narrow.At the end of October, ElBaradei wrote to Iran in an attempt to clearly define the activities that required suspension. The first request, apparently undisputed, involves putting a stop to testing or operating gas centrifuges, a halt to the installation of centrifuges at Natanz, and ceasing laser enrichment and plutonium reprocessing activities. There appears to be some question however regarding Iran's response to ElBaradei's requests to cease the production and assembly of centrifuges or centrifuge components other than at Natanz, as well as halting equipment imports relevant to the program.
The United States claims that Kvant Company, based in Chisinau, Moldova, helped Iran produce nuclear weapons. The company was founded in 1950 and specialized in electronic military equipment. It went bankrupt in 2001.
The United States Congress passes the 1992 Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, which prohibits the export of nuclear equipment and technology as well as exports to Iran of dual use technology and US government commercial arms sales.
The United States continues to urge China to abandon its plan to construct a uranium hexafluoride conversion plant in Iran. Iran wants the plant for its commercial nuclear power plant program. US officials, however, contend that the plant is part of Iran's nuclear weapons development program. The plant would convert uranium oxide to a gaseous state so that it can be enriched to fuel-grade material, either through diffusion or centrifuge technology.
The United States is ready to resume some diplomatic talks with Iran. US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage says, "We are prepared to engage in limited discussions with the government of Iran about areas of mutual interest as appropriate."
The United States pressures Russia over its nuclear links with Iran by sending the US arms control chief to Moscow. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Kislyak says in interview with the Vremya Novostei Daily, "I think our American colleagues understand very well that it is pointless to put pressure on us."
The United States proposes to the G-7 nations that COCOM [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] export restrictions be eased and a new system created to monitor the export of conventional weapons, raw materials, and dual-use technologies to developing countries. However, the United States will only weaken the restrictions in return for a pledge that the former socialist states will not export military technologies to developing countries engaged in regional conflicts, including Iran.
The United States says Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov is planning to sell Iran uranium-enriching gas centrifuges. Sometime afterward, perhaps in May, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev says he did not know about a deal for gas centrifuges. [Note: For more on the alleged centrifuge deal see 4, 5, 11, 12, 17, and 18 May 1995 entries.]
The United States sends a delegation including Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and Undersecretary of State John Bolton to Moscow. The trip was planned before Russia announced a new proposal for expanded nuclear cooperation with Iran, but the issue will be raised. [See 26 July 2002 entry.] "It's fair to say the White House was infuriated by that and extremely surprised by the proposal," a US official says. "What we were told was: It's a draft and it's not done." In talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks, President Bush believed Putin had assured him that Russia would limit its nuclear cooperation with Iran. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Marshall Billingslea tells a Senate hearing, "If we were upset about one reactor at Bushehr, you can imagine how upset we would be at the prospect of five or six."
Aleksei Yablokov, chairman of the Security Council commission for ecological security, says that the nuclear power plant Russia is planning to build at Bushehr will have the capability to produce weapons-grade plutonium. "Thanks to Russia, Iran will be in a position to get the nuclear bomb within a few years," Yablokov says.
The United States still voices concerns over Iran's nuclear program. Colin Powell is noted as telling French journalist, "They have tried to hide their weapons program from the IAEA and the international community."
The United States tries to persuade China not to deliver a research reactor at Isfahan. China decides to go ahead with the deal in September 1992 after the United States sells F-16 fighters to Taiwan.
The United States urges the South African government not to share nuclear-related information with Iran. The United States concern was raised by a March 1995 meeting on nuclear issues between South African Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha and Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Acting on British and German information regarding Iran's military ambitions, South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo wrote in an unsent 13 April 1995 letter to Botha, "I believe any cooperation in the nuclear field between Iran and South Africa has the potential to damage our international reputation as a responsible possessor of advanced technologies." The letter was never sent because of the belief that talks focused only on nuclear medical isotopes. [Note: On 19 August 1995, Botha said that talks with Amrollahi had also covered a previously discarded scheme for South Africa to sell enriched uranium to Iran.]
The United States warns Russia that it would impose sanctions if it does not halt cooperation with Iran's nuclear and missile programs. Some US government programs with Russian nuclear institutions have already been curtailed. According to State Department spokesman James Rubin, the United States is aware that a number of Russian institutions are engaged with cooperation with Iran and is ready to take decisive action to stop the flow of sensitive technologies to Iran. If Russia does not cease cooperation with Iran's ballistic missile program, the United States government may not approve expansion of the space launch market. Russia currently earns "hundreds of millions of dollars annually" from US-Russian collaboration on a satellite launch program. Russia made a commitment to limit its assistance to Bushehr. However, the United States is confident that Iran is using the Bushehr project as a cover to acquire sensitive Russian nuclear technology.
The United States, Japan, and countries in Western Europe lift controls on high-tech goods to Eastern Europe, making it easier for Iraq, Iran, and North Korea to buy dual-use goods for nuclear weapons through Eastern Europe. A US State Department official says Iran is researching enrichment methods and that it probably had "agents in Europe scouring the market" for needed technology.
The United States, resolute in its opposition to Russian participation in Iranian nuclear affairs, offers "to lift all 'space' quotas for Russia in exchange for the cessation of construction work on the nuclear power station in Iran."
The US administration calls for a total embargo on nuclear technology to Iran and urges other nuclear suppliers, including China, to take similar action. The United States asks France to join an embargo against Iran. French officials reply that "this is not a question of export control policy. This is politics, full stop. American does not like the current Iranian regime, and they want us to buy on to their hatred of the moment. No way."
The US Arms Controls and Disarmament Agency reports to Congress that "although Iran's rudimentary [nuclear] program has apparently met with limited success so far, we believe Iran remains intent on acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. Iran's questionable nonproliferation credentials have caused many nuclear suppliers to refrain from cooperation with Tehran."
The US Central Intelligence Agency reports that Iran is using Russian expertise and technology to expedite its nuclear weapons program. Some US and Israeli officials believe that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within five years. Iran's mission to the United Nation flatly denies these allegations in a statement which read that "Iran does not, and will not, in light of its own national interest, engage in a nuclear weapon program."
The US Congress passes new economic sanctions against Iran and President Clinton signs them. The new legislation draws upon the "D'Amato Bill," a set of strict sanctions against Iran. According to the new law, any foreign company investing over $40 million that "significantly and materially contribute[s] to the development of petroleum resources in Iran" will be subject to economic sanctions. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, sponsor of the bill, says, "Our intention is to let Iran know that if they continue to export revolution, support terrorism, and develop weapons of mass destruction, we will keep the pressure on."
The US Defense Department releases a report that says "Chinese and Russian supply policies are key to Iran's success" in acquiring nuclear weapons.
The US Defense Department releases a report that says, "At this stage, Iran's scientific and technical base remains insufficient to support major nuclear programs. The Iranians recognize their dependence on foreign assistance and are encouraging younger Iranians to study abroad to gain needed technical assistance."
The US Department of Commerce approves the sale of high-technology equipment to Iran during a 13-month period in 1990-1991 worth $59 million. The director of the Washington, DC-based group the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, Gary Milholin, says that the equipment sold to Iran by the Commerce Department constitutes dual-use technology that can be used to produce nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
The US Department of Defense reports that because of tight resources and a relatively less developed technological base, Iran is not likely to produce fissile material on its own.
The US Department of State calls China's sale of a nuclear reactor to Iran an "imprudent move" as this will heighten Iran's nuclear capability. The State Department fears that the reactor could be used for the development of nuclear weapons.
The US government discloses intelligence information that Russian entities are involved in transferring WMD technology to Iran. The Russian government cracks down on the sources of information, thus preventing any further leaks about Russian-Iranian WMD activities. The Russian government action virtually stops intelligence collection, especially in the years 1998 and 1999. These years are marked by intense Iranian activities in its WMD programs.
The US government imposes sanctions on six companies (5 Chinese and 1 North Korean) for selling weapons technology to Iran. The sanctions include a ban on trading with and receiving assistance from the US government and are to remain in place for two years. The six companies to be sanctioned are:
The US House of Representatives passes a measure to withhold funds from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) programs that assist Iran in the construction of a nuclear power plant. The measure, sponsored by New Jersey Democratic Representative Robert Menendez, would allow the release of funds to the IAEA only if the secretary of state certifies that Iran is not using the money to acquire sensitive nuclear technology or for military uses.
The US military commander in the Persian Gulf says Iran can build nuclear weapons by 2000 if its gets fissionable material. "If they can get those," says General Binford Peay, "you will see them be able to bring that to some form of weaponization, and I would predict to you that would be some time at the turn of the century, the near-end of the turn of the century." Peay says he does not know how close Iran is to getting a nuclear weapon. "I would n't want to put a day on it," he says. "I don't know if it's 2010, 2007, or 2003. I am just saying that I think it is coming closer."
The US representative at the Conference of Disarmament in Geneva states that Iran, India, and Pakistan dispute negotiation on banning the testing of nuclear weapons. Whereas Pakistan refuses to sign until India does so, India refuses because of the Western pressure. Iran refuses because Israel is not under pressure to sign the Treaty of Non-Proliferation. [Note: Iran announces on 11 September 1996 that it will sign the treaty.]
The US Secretary of State Warren Christopher calls for a cancellation of a Chinese plan to sell two 300MW reactors to Iran. Iran has reportedly sent an initial payment to China, while China has done seismic surveys of the Esteqlal site, located near the Bushehr complex. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen tells US Secretary of State Warren Christopher that China's decision to sell Iran two 300MW pressurized water reactors (PWRs) was consistent with international law.
The US Senate approves legislation that would authorize sanctions on all entities that cooperate with Iran's biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons programs.
The US Senate votes 97-3 to cease funding a nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia if Russia provides Iran with a nuclear reactor. The Senate bill will have to be harmonized with one already passed in the US House of Representatives.
The US State Department spokesman says the United States does not have enough evidence to impose sanctions on China for its nuclear assistance to Iran. State Department spokesman Nick Burns says in a briefing that "We are willing to and we are obligated to implement our law, but we can't do it based on suppositions or appearances. We must do it on concrete evidence, and we are pursuing that concrete evidence right now." He says, "While the United States continues to be concerned about many actions of the government of China regarding proliferation, and while we discuss this in fact, Secretary Albright discussed it just the other day in Hong Kong with Vice Premier Qian Qichenâwe cannot find a country guilty of violating a law without evidence, without concrete evidence. We don't have that evidence in the current realm."
The Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran reports that Li Lanqing, China's vice-premier, and Hamid Mirzadeh, Iran's vice-president, concluded a four-day meeting in which they created a memorandum calling for the construction of two 300MW nuclear power plants in Iran. The Chinese agency Xinhua says the project is "only for peaceful use of nuclear energy and will be put under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency." [Note: See 31 October 1992, November 1992.]
The Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran reports that the nuclear reactors under construction in Iran and their facilities are under international supervision, with experts freely visiting the nuclear and chemical facilities.
The Wall Street Journal reports that Siemens, the company that held the contract to build the nuclear reactor in Bushehr, would be willing to aid Iran indirectly with the continuation of the reactor. Iran has been asking for export licenses from Germany for the continuation of the project. The Wall Street Journal further notes that Iranian Secret Service Minister Ali Fallahian met with representatives of Siemens in Munich. Siemens had signed a contract with the Czech company Skoda-Energo, and stated that they themselves would not be willing to end the construction of the reactor in Bushehr. The Czechs have just recently sold fuel rods from the closed Greifswald reactor. American intelligence services believe that Siemens may have been trying to give the Iranian Secret Service Minister access to these fuel rods through the Czechs.[Note: See 16 October for Siemens denial.]
The Washington Post reports that many Iranian scientists, including Ahmad Sofudehnia, have returned from exile or have been released from jail to work on developing Iran's nuclear programs.
The Washington Post reports that Pakistan denies charges that it has sold centrifuge design data it stole from Urenco to Iran.
The Washington Post reports that President Clinton's call for a multilateral trade embargo against Iran fell on deaf ears in Europe and received a lukewarm reception from Japan. Many European countries have refused to participate, arguing that political dialogue is the only way to influence Iranian behavior. Japan may consider again suspending its loans to Iran, but its dependence on Iranian oil is likely to keep Japan from going much farther. Without the cooperation of other major trading nations, the US embargo is unlikely to have much effect on Iran.
The Washington Post reports that the Iranian government saved the International Center for Theoretical Physics through a timely $3 million loan. The center is a small, advanced science and nuclear physics facility located in Trieste above the Adriatic Sea run by Mohammed Abdus Salam, Pakistan's preeminent theoretical and nuclear physicist, who oversees post-doctoral work done by government-employed nuclear and other scientists from Third World countries including Iran.
The Washington Post reports that US Ambassador to Beijing J. Stapleton Ray successfully lobbied Chinese officials into stopping the transfer of a research reactor to Iran for "technical reasons." Such a reactor contains Western parts, which can be embargoed to block the sale. Iranian Ambassador to the IAEA Mohammed Ayatollahi had stated that Iran was seeking fuel-fabrication technology because there had been supply problems with the enriched uranium shipped from Argentina. [Note: The reactor proposed for transfer is probably a 20MW reactor. See 23 September and 1 October 1992 entries.]
The Washington Post reports that US Ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency Richard T. Kennedy managed to block Argentina's deal to supply Iran with equipment for making heavy water and nuclear fuel by agreeing to assist Investigaciones Aplicadas (INVAP), the company involved in the canceled sale, to find alternative business in the United States by developing ties with General Atomics, Inc.
The Washington Post reports that while Iran has finished the equivalent of five months of work on the Bushehr reactor in the past 25 months, Russia plans to finish the reactor in 30 months. Both Iran and Russia deny that the project will provide Iran with nuclear weapons technology.
The Washington Post reports UN nuclear inspectors have come across further undisclosed research in Iran. Iran experimented with polonium-210, which "heightens suspicions because polonium-210 is so linked to a certain type of neutron-initiator." Iran acknowledges the experiments but points to polonium's possible use also in power generation and says the experiments occurred "some time ago."
The Washington Times reports that China is supplying a reactor and an electromagnetic isotope separator to Iran. Syria is trying to buy a Chinese nuclear reactor.
The Washington Times reports that Chinese experts will soon arrive in Iran to begin construction on a uranium enrichment plant near the city of Isfahan. The article reports that the new plant will process uranium ore and other products that can be used in nuclear weapons.
The Washington Times reports that in the last few weeks, information has surfaced that China has again tried to sell nuclear equipment with weapons applications to Iran even after promising to halt nuclear exports to Iran.
Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the Russian Federation Security Council's InterdepartmentalCommission for Ecological Safety, says Russia had agreed to deliver gas centrifuges to Iran in a protocol to the Russian-Iranian agreement to build a nuclear power station."According to the protocol, delivery of centrifuges to Iran i snot an immediate task but will happen in six months or so,"Yablokov says. But another Russian official, Georgiy Kaurov,head of the information directorate of the Russian Ministryfor Atomic Energy, contradicts Yablokov on the centrifuge deal. Kaurov says "there is nothing about the installation of centrifuges or the transfer of centrifugal technology" in the Russian-Iran nuclear agreement. [Note: Yablokov refers to the protocol to the agreement, not the agreement itself, whileKaurov is speaking about the actual agreement, so both could be speaking correctly.] Yablokov says a centrifuge deal would raise many questions about Iran's intentions: "It is the military atom that Iran wants to develop....If Iran has a nuclear station, it won't need a uranium enrichment [gas centrifuge] facility at all. It is a thousand times cheaper to buy fuel, which is necessary for the power station, from the same country which is building the station." Yablokov also raises questions about why Iran needs nuclear energy at all:"According to the protocol to the agreement, we will train 20Iranian scientists in our classified facilities. But why does Iran need so many specialists for one power station? Iran,with its enormous supplies of gas and oil, should also explain to the world community why it needs to develop nuclear power engineering at all, as it is much cheaper to obtain energy from gas and oil. The enrichment of uranium, large-scale training of scientists, modern nuclear technologies which Russia will inevitably pass on to Iran together with the power station--this is very dangerous."
The Washington Times reports that Iran has moved air defense missiles to its nuclear facilities. These missiles consist of several batteries of US-made Hawk missiles that have been improved and are now dubbed I-Hawks and are deployed around the Bushehr area.
The Washington Times reports that only 5 out of 11 nuclear facilities in Iran are under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Though the Isfahan nuclear complex was inspected by the IAEA in 1992, with no discrepancies noted, half of the complex is reported to be built underground, while the other half is hidden by camouflage, the report says. Isfahan is the focus of Iran's nuclear weapons program, manned by personnel trained in China and Russia, the report says. The article says that, until the Russians agreed to sell Iran two VVER 440 reactors in August 1995, the IAEA, the United States, and Britain knew nothing of the Neka complex, the reactors' destination. Neka is 100 miles northeast of Tehran.
The Washington Times reports that President Clinton has placed economic sanctions on
The Washington Times reports that Reza Amrollahi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said that the country would have several nuclear plants within the next 10 years. He also said that countries that refuse to help Iran with its program "will lose," in an apparent reference to West Germany, which will not allow Siemens to complete construction on a nuclear plant begun before 1980. However, "Iran is believed to closely cooperate in such matters with [China]," and India has offered to build atomic plants abroad to generate hard currency.
The Washington Times reports that the US Congressional Research Service published a report by Kenneth Katzman and Rinn-sup Shinn that notes that "there is concern that North Korea may transfer nuclear technology to Iran" in order to obtain Iranian financing for its nuclear efforts. The report noted US fears that North Korea may sell "a completed nuclear weapon or key nuclear technology" to its clients in the Middle East who have been purchasing North Korean ballistic missile technology, including Iran.
The Washington Times reports that the US government fears that new relations between the Russian intelligence services and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) may involve "disclosures" of classified CIA information on Iran's nuclear weapons program that was presented to Russia in spring 1995. US intelligence about Iranian attempts to obtain technologies and equipment for its nuclear weapons program was shared with Russian officials in an attempt to persuade those officials to halt Russia's sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. The Senate Intelligence Committee, at the request of Senator Jon Kyl, is investigating possible leaks of US-held information on Iranian nuclear activities. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, when asked about the Russia-Iran intelligence connection, says: "I better not comment on that because what I know is classified. I don't know why it's classified... I'm not anti-Yeltsin, but I think he's wrong as hell on this."
The Washington Times reports that US officials believe China has been a major contributor to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program and is also providing Iran and Algeria with nuclear weapons technology.
The Washington Times reports that, according to the US Office of Naval Intelligence's (ONI) report on worldwide maritime challenges, China has been shipping critical military technology and materials to Iran and Iraq, to be used in their nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs.
The Washington, DC-based Defense and Foreign Affairs Strategic Policy newsletter reports Iran is within two months of reassembling nuclear warheads acquired from the former Soviet Union. Iran has hired nuclear scientists from Kazakhstan.
The Wassenaar Agreement comes into effect. With this agreement, the sales of strategic dual use items to Iran are curtailed. The United States seeks to persuade other Western industrialized countries not to reschedule any existing credits to Iran, not to issue any new credits, and to oppose new loans for Iran from multilateral banks.
The White House expresses "serious concerns" with regard to a report that parts found in Iran by UN nuclear inspectors appear to correspond to those of a P-2 centrifuge. Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi claims that the P-2 is merely part of a research program, about which the IAEA has been informed.
The White House indicates that the Russia-Iran nuclear deal could strain relations between Russia and the United States. The administration is seeking to deny Iran advanced technologies by intensifying efforts to dissuade Western nations from providing subsidized loans to Iran. The administration has been successful in persuading Western European nations and Japan not to supply nuclear technology to Iran, and is continuing to press the issue with these countries.
There are currently about 30 Russian nuclear specialists working at Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant. [Note: See 17 March 1996 for a report that 600 Russians are working there.] Russian specialists will conduct a survey of the buildings at the Bushehr nuclear plant, said Aleksandr Bryukhov, an executive supervising the construction of Russian nuclear power plants abroad. The Bushehr nuclear power plant is expected to start operating in 2001.
Thomas Graham, a senior official at the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency says that Iran has "no current program" for the production of weapons-grade nuclear material. However, Graham said that the US government has "reached the conclusion" that Iran intends to develop a nuclear weapon capability in the future. Graham also says that Iran is in full compliance with all of its Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations, noting that the United States is more concerned with Iran's future intentions. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) has repudiates European and US allegations that Iran has key chemicals to separate plutonium from irradiated uranium fuel. According to certain European and US sources, Iranian officials at AEOI seek a peaceful nuclear program and would like to build nuclear reactors with Russian and Chinese help. However, other non-AEOI officials in Iran believe that "Iran should have nuclear weapons capabilities."
Though there has been discussion of the possible construction of two additional nuclear power plants in Iran, Sergei Tretyakov, Russia's Ambassador to Iran, says Russia will focus on the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran for the time being. He states, "The (old) project still stands but there have been no recent negotiations on the subject. It could be undertaken one day, but not before the completion of the other plant."
Time magazine reports that Iran has an enrichment plant--possibly a centrifuge facility--at Moallem Kalayeh and may have another centrifuge plant at Karaj. These reports are termed "speculative" by a nuclear industry journal.
Time publishes an interview with Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who declares that nuclear weapons are not in the interest of anyone. He says it would be irrational for Iran to use its limited resources to develop nuclear weapons, and that nuclear weapons can never be used in the region. Asked about a potential nuclear war between India and Pakistan, he says Iran is more concerned with Israel's nuclear potential. President Rafsanjani says that even if countries of the Third World tried to acquire nuclear weapons, they could never compete with the major nuclear powers.
To assist France, Britain and Germany in negotiations with Iran over its enrichment program, IAEA head Mohamed ElBaradei has offered to guarantee Iran a supply of fuel for its nuclear power plants in return for abandoning uranium enrichment activities.
To counter what he believes to be "discriminatory" acts by foreign powers toward Iran, Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's foreign minister, says "the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] should seriously work for a review in the general policies on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and removing the restrictions and monopolizations for access to the nuclear technologies that are aimed at peaceful utilization of nuclear energy."
To dismiss accusations that Minatom was not answerable to the Russia government, Viktor Kozlov, general director of Atomstroiexport, which serves as the marketing arm of Russia's atomic energy ministry (Minatom), assures that all the activities of Atomstroiexport are answerable to the Russian government. He said, "Our activities are completely under state control... we were able to start negotiations with Iran only after the state signed an intergovernmental agreement. We have no right to do anything without permission."
Top Iranian negotiator Hassan Rowhani affirms that Iran has not abandoned its right to enrich uranium as the agreed upon suspension is only temporary while the IAEA inspects Iranian nuclear sites over several months. EU officials still hope Iran will make the suspension permanent in return for trade deals and other incentives.
Top Iranian nuclear negotiator Hassan Mousavian declares, "We have not yet seen considerable progress in our cooperation and no incentives in political, security, technological, economic and nuclear fields. Now it is time to deliver something to Iranian public opinion and nation." French Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie defends efforts to urge Iran to relinquish its nuclear fuel enrichment program, adding that negotiations are "hampered by lack of trust on both sides." Meanwhile, Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice says the United States would "rebuff European efforts to bring it into negotiations with Iran,"
Top Iranian nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani has warned that "tangible progress" is necessary from the upcoming meeting with European governments to avoid a breakdown of talks.
Traces of uranium detected last year by UN inspectors are revealed to include some enriched to 90 percent -- weapons grade. The IAEA suggests that the source of the contamination may have been Pakistan.
Trade with Iran, Boris Yeltsin states, is consistent with the Russo-American bilateral commission's analysis that Russia has not delivered military missile or nuclear technologies to Iran. "Maybe there will be some supplies of armaments, but not of missiles or missile weapons-grade uranium technologies."
Turkey announces it is "uncomfortable" with Iran's efforts to develop nuclear arms, believing Iran will choose to pursue nuclear weapons development if South Asia's nuclear programs prove successful. Ambassador Korkmaz Haktanir, undersecretary of the Foreign Ministry, says Turkey is specifically wary of Iran acquiring nuclear technology.
Two Iranian citizens, Don Danesh and Reza Amiri, are arrested by federal agents in Newport Beach, CA, for allegedly shipping to Iran portable oscilloscopes, which can be used in analyzing nuclear tests. [Note: See 28 August 1991. See 30 March 1992 for their conviction.]
Two Iranian diplomats discuss via telephone the acquisition of four nuclear warheads by Iran from one of the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. The two diplomats are identified as an Iranian Foreign Ministry official Abdolrahmani, who is in charge of relations with the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union, and Iranian Deputy Sirus Nasiri Tabatabai-Kia, who is second in command in the Iranian delegation to United Nations institutions and international organizations in Geneva. In the tapped phone conversation between Abdolrahmani and Tabatabai-Kia, which is obtained from an European intelligence service, Abdolrahmani confirms that one of the Muslim republics of the former Soviet Union sold four warheads to Iran. Tabatabai-Kia notes that the purchases "completed their mission in the best possible way." Abdolrahmani says that the warheads had not arrived because of a problem with transportation, and that he does not know how much the warheads cost because "some other guy arranged the issue of the payment." In the course of the conversation, the names of Iranian President Rafsanjani's brother-in-law Hajj Mohsen Rafij, and the Iranian defense minister Akbar Torkan are mentioned in connection with the sale.
Aleksey Yablokov, former adviser on scientific and environmental issues in Russia, says in an interview that Yeltsin "banned the Atomic Energy Ministry from selling brand-new uranium enrichment technologies to Iran in 1995, but the part of the program covering training of Iranian scientists in Russia has remained in force."
Two Iranian officials visit Bonn, Germany. One of the officials, Javad Larijani, states that the most "negative point" in German-Iranian relations is Germany's refusal to continue construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Today, the officials are expected to visit the Siemens corporation in Munich. [Note: Siemens was building the reactor in Bushehr before the government pulled out of the contract. See February 1991 and 30 June 1991 for other meetings between Iran and Germany.]
U.S. officials announce they have uncovered evidence that associates of Pakistani A.Q. Khan met with Iranian officials 18 years ago and offered Tehran "the makings of a nuclear weapons program." The meeting purportedly took place in Dubai, when at that time, Iran purchased centrifuge designs and a starter kit for uranium enrichment. The U.S. administration believes this demonstrates Iran's interest over the years in nuclear weapons technology, but a Western diplomat said this is a "strong indication...but it does n't prove it completely." Tehran responded by pointing out that Iran had the opportunity to purchase the equipment for building the core of a bomb, but turned it down.
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell meets with 25 current and future EU members to discuss whether Iran's nuclear program should be declared in violation of the NPT. Powell fails to persuade his counterparts that such a declaration should be supported at the IAEA board meeting on November 20th.
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice refers to Russia's "positive role" in the construction of Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant, saying it assists non-proliferation objectives in Iran.
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice warns Iran that the Bush administration's patience is not unending, adding: "It is obvious that, if Iran cannot be made to live up to its international obligations, the IAEA statutes suggest Iran would have to be referred to the UN Security Council."
U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith expresses U.S. support for diplomatic pressure on Iran to abandon its alleged nuclear weapons program, presenting Libya's recent decision to relinquish its WMD as a possible model for future action.
U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton greets the IAEA's report on Iran saying that it is "impossible to believe" and that the report in fact underscores the U.S. stance that "the massive and covert Iranian efforts to acquire sensitive nuclear capabilities make sense only as part of a nuclear weapons program." British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw strikes a less critical note in his response to the report, affirming that although the report was "very worrying in terms of what it discloses, [it] also shows a pretty high level of cooperation."
U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton states that Iran told European Union members that it can produce sufficient weapons-grade uranium for an atomic bomb in one year. Bolton asserts that the United States has tried diplomacy but sees Iran as a threat, and therefore prefers isolation versus engagement with it on the nuclear issue.
Ukraine reaffirms its commitment to Israel not to provide turbines for use in Iran's planned nuclear reactor in Bushehr. Ukraine's Secretary of State for National Security assures Avigdor Qahalani, Israel's public ecurity minister, that he will not allow such a project to continue. Interfax reports that Volodymyr Yatsenkivsky, Ukraine's Acting Chief of the information department of the Foreign Ministry, states in the No. 239 business report for August 18-25 that Ukraine never signed contracts to supply turbines to the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister GennadiyUdovenko and US Secretary of State Madeline Albright sign a nuclear cooperation agreement ending all Ukrainian nuclear cooperation with Iran. In return, the United States will support Ukraine's bid to become a member of the MissileTechnology Control Regime. Albright describes Ukraine's mo veto end nuclear commerce with Tehran as an act of, "great statesmanship." US officials expect Ukraine's decision to delay the completion of the 1,000MW nuclear reactor atBushehr, which Russia is building. Ukraine's AOA Turboatom ofKharkiv was to build a $45 million turbine for the $850million light water reactor. Moscow has said that it will produce the turbine for itself at a St. Petersburg plant,contradicting one US official who said no one else in the world could makes the turbines, "such that they can be bough toff the shelf for Bushehr." At the signing ceremony, UkrainianPresident Leonid Kuchma echoes Moscow's appraisal, saying that Russia could produce the turbine for itself. The RussianAtomic Energy Ministry believes Ukraine's withdrawal from the project does not upset the time table for the completion of the Bushehr station, "Ukraine is just one subcontractor which can be replaced quite easily with another," notes VitaliyNasonov, a spokesman for the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry.Possibly responding to the US attempt to sabotage the Bushehrproject, Georgy Kaurov, spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, announces that Moscow has reached an agreement in principle with Tehran to build two additional reactors atBushehr.
Alexander Kudryavtsev, Russian Atomic Energy Minister, says that despite Russian and Iranian divergence over payment schedule and technical specification, the cooperation between Iran and Russia will continue. He adds that 5,000 tons of material has been shipped to Bushehr. Iran has requested the construction of three new nuclear reactors. However, Russia has not agreed to the request yet. Iran cancelled a visit of its foreign affairs minister after Putin refused to meet with him.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Hannadii Udovenko says that Ukraine may sign a contract to provide Russia with a 1,000MW turbine for a reactor it is building in Bushehr, Iran. The Kharkiv-based factory, Turboatom, made the proposal, according to Interfax. The United States and Israel contend that the Bushehr plant may help Iran develop nuclear weapons. Udovenko said that signing the contract with Russia "could complicate relations with [Ukraine's] partners." According to Israeli Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma promised that Ukraine would not provide the turbines to Russia, nor "do anything to help Iran, Iraq, or Libya build weapons of mass destruction."
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma says that his country will not sell Iran turbines for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. According to Volodymyr Ogryzko, head of the president's Foreign Policy Department, "Ukraine is not involved in any sort of activities related to the project." Orgyzko does say, however, that relations with Iran "are developing" and that any cooperation will fall under international regulations. An official from Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy says "all the necessary equipment for the nuclear power plant is produced in Russia, so we do not need the help of third countries in this case." An organization in St. Petersburg, Russia will make the turbines for the Bushehr plant. [Note: Ukraine later decides that it will sell turbines to Iran. See 26 July 1997.]
Alexander Losyukov, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, says that Russia does not see anything threatening in its cooperation with Iran. He also mentions that cooperation with Iran is moving at a very good level, and that it corresponds to Russia wish to develop good neighborly relation with Iran.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Anatoly Kinakh says that Ukraine had severe economic losses because it complied with the United States and did not sell nuclear reactors to Iran. Yet, it is getting nothing in return. Officials at the state-owned Turboatom say that the Ukrainian nuclear industry lost $1.5 billion because it agreed not to sell the reactor to Iran.
Ukrainian Weekly reports that the United States and Russia are placing conflicting pressures on Ukraine over its potential sale of turbines to Russia. Russia needs the turbines to construct a nuclear power plant in Iran. Ukraine would prefer to allow turbine manufacturer Turboatom to sell at least one turbine to Russia. Ukraine is not expected to make a final decision until late March 1998. If Ukraine sells the turbines to Russia, Russia has promised to provide its own technology and credits to complete two power plants in Ukraine. If Ukraine decides not to sell the turbines, however, they will be forced to forfeit all future dealings with Russian firms, resulting in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. The United States opposes the transfer of any nuclear technology to Iran, despite the fact that Iran has promised to accept international safeguards for the new facility. The United States believes Iran will ultimately use the technology to make nuclear weapons.
UN General-Secretary Kofi Annan says there is no evidence that Iran is attempting to acquire nuclear weapons.
UN inspectors reveal that the unexpected source of some of the highly enriched uranium found on Iranian nuclear machinery is Russia, apparently via the black market versus by government approval. The "strong clue" on which lab studies centered was a 36 percent enrichment level, which occurs only in Russia. Thirty-six percent is short of the 90 percent necessary for bomb-making.
UN nuclear inspectors find traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium at a second site in Iran. Diplomats say minute quantities of uranium were found last month at the Kalaye Electric Company on the southern outskirts of the capital, Tehran. The IAEA's board of governors has set a 31 October deadline for Iran to disprove US claims that it is secretly trying to make nuclear weapons.
Alexander Lusyukov, Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister, says that Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation will not be at the expense of other countries. He also rejects US and Israeli allegations that the Russian-Iranian cooperation will put Iran in a position to produce nuclear weapons.
Under pressure from the United States, the Czech parliament approves a law to ban all Czech exports to the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. The purpose of the bill was to prevent the ZVVZ Milevsko company from cooperating with Iran in the construction of the Bushehr plant. Last year, the company signed a $30 million contract to provide air conditioning ducts for the plant. The lower chamber of the Czech parliament approved the bill in March at a time when Czech President Vaclav Havel assured US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that the government would ban such exports to Iran. The lower chamber rejected a proposed modification to provide compensation for the loss of revenue to the company, but the ministry of industry will provide compensation. Violations of the new law will be punished with a $563,000 fine and the confiscation of goods. President Havel must still sign the bill before it can be enforced.
Under US pressure, China announces that plans to sell Iran two nuclear reactors have been cancelled. Chen Chi Chan, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says that the agreement between China and Iran for a nuclear power plant has been frozen, but that China is still interested in the continuation of the cooperation between the two countries. [Note: US officials said on 27 September 1995 that China canceled the deal, but on 29 September 1995, a Chinese official said the deal was not cancelled.]
Unian reports that Ukraine is under pressure to reconsider its decision not to participate in the construction of the nuclear complex in Bushehr. Russia has told Ukraine that some parts of the nuclear plants that were planned to be built in India can be transferred to Ukrainian companies.
Unnamed officials at the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry say the ministry hopes to get contracts for an additional 1,000MW reactor and two 400MW reactors in Iran after the first 1,000MW reactor is finished at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. [Note: They are probably referring to two 440MW reactors, not 400MW, that have been under discussion for some time between Russian and Iran.]
Upon arriving to his new post in Iran, Russia's ambassador to Iran, Konstantin Shuvalov, says that nuclear cooperation between the two countries "is being carried out in strictest compliance with international norms and poses no danger to peace and security in the region."
Alexander Maidannik, press secretary to Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, says Ukraine gets more benefits by not selling components for the Bushehr nuclear power plant than by participating in the project. [Note: See 6 March 1998.] He cites promises of US aid to Ukraine, including for the Kharhov region, where the plant that was to build turbines for the Bushehr project is located.
Upon his return from Pakistan and India, Kamal Kharazi, Iran's foreign minister, reports that "the atmosphere is conducive for Indo-Pak serious and comprehensive talks." He further states that both Pakistan and India are willing to put a temporary moratorium on further tests until negotiations are finalized. Both countries, he proclaims, show "positive signs" that they would be willing to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if it is "based on mutual confidence and on the framework of the military strength and capabilities of the two nations." Kharazi states that Iran "does not encourage the procurement and manufacture of nuclear weapons and that Iran is not at all interested in doing so." He believes Pakistan's detonation represents a symbol within the Islamic community of resolute opposition to what it believes is an Israeli threat. Iran's foreign minister further stresses Iran does not have a definitive plan regarding nuclear weapon procurement, and that it does "want to see that nuclear disarmament program become effective."
Upon request of the Information Ministry, the nuclear spies case has been referred to it - the case's "complexity" has caused delays in reaching a final verdict.
Uri Lubrani, an official with the Israeli Defense Ministry, meets in Washington with US officials about Iran's non-conventional weapons program.
US administration officials say that China has completely severed nuclear cooperation with Iran and are preparing a statement that will minimize Iran's reaction. The report says that China reached this decision in order to encourage the United States to implement the 1985 bilateral agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation, which would allow American companies to export nuclear technology to China.
US Ambassador to China, J. Stapelton Roy, visits a Chinese nuclear reactor outside Beijing and inspects a model of the reactor destined for Iran. On the occasion, US diplomats pressure Chinese officials to cancel the transfer.
A CIA report claims that Iran has 'vigorously' pursued WMD production, seeking help variously from Russia, China, North Korea, and Europe in its efforts. Further, the semi-annual unclassified report to Congress states that the "United States remains convinced that Tehran has been pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons program." CIA imagery suggests that Iran is burying a uranium centrifuge enrichment facility at Natanz, about 100 miles south of Tehran, presumably to protect it in case of attack.
US and Ukrainian officials discuss the sale of two turbines from Ukrainian company Turboatom to a Russian company for use at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The United States opposes the sale. Volodymyr Horbulin, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, says the United States and Ukrainian governments will decide in the next two or three weeks whether the sale will go through. Russian news sources report that the United States and Russia have reached a tentative agreement regarding the export of Ukranian equipment for the Iranian nuclear reactor power plant in Bushehr. The plant is to consist of one VVER-1000 light water nuclear reactor that can generate 1,000MW.
US Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs Bernard Aronson, during a meeting with Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella, expresses concern over the planned sale of nuclear material to Iran by Argentina's Investigaciones Aplicadas (INVAP). Initially, the Argentine government said that the sale could go through if Iran signed a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency within 40 days. [Note: See 26 January 1992 for Argentina's decision to suspend the sale.]
US Assistant Secretary of State John Wolf accuses Iran of cheating on its obligation under the NPT, stating that Iran has an "alarming, clandestine program" and "is going down the same path of denial and deception that handicapped international inspections in North Korea and Iraq."
US Assistant Secretary of State Thomas McNamara says Germany is unintentionally helping Iran develop nuclear weapons by aiding Iran's civilian nuclear program. "There's no way to do it without facilitating Iran's attempts to develop a nuclear weapons capability," he says.
US companies export dual-use technologies to Iran, including "toxins, turbojet engines, air or vacuum pumps, machinery for liquefying gas, centrifuges and centrifuge parts, machine-tool holders, gas separation equipment, hydraulic presses, and laboratory furnaces," without proper Department of Commerce (DOC) licensing or inspection, according to US Senate testimony in 1995 by Kenneth R. Timmerman, director of the Middle East Data Project. An official from the Department of Commerce in 1995 describes Timmerman's testimony as "inaccurate and without foundation."
Alexander Romiantsov, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, reiterates the peaceful nature of Bushehr power plant. He points that 60 expert groups of the IAEA have traveled to Iran and yet to detect any violations.
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accuses Russia of helping Iran in developing nuclear weapons.
US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says that Iran's goal behind acquiring nuclear technology is clear. Iran is trying to develop "the full spectrum" of weapons of mass destruction, he says.
US Defense Secretary William Perry says Iran may be closer than previously thought to getting a nuclear weapon. "How soon...depends how they go about getting it," he says. He says Iran could get a bomb from the former Soviet Union, which could happen in "a week, a month, five years." He says if Iran gets enough fissile material, "five years is on the high end," while otherwise it "will take them much longer than five years," though this time could be shortened by hiring experts from the former Soviet Union.
US Diplomatic sources claim that the uranium enrichment facility near Natanz is much further along than previously revealed. They claim that the plant is "extremely advanced" where "hundreds" of gas centrifuges are assembled and ready to enrich uranium. The plant allegedly also contains "the parts for a thousand others ready to be assembled."
US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and Undersecretary of State John Bolton meet with Russia's Atomic Energy Minister Alexander Rumyantsev to discuss issues relating to nuclear proliferation and Russia's nuclear cooperation with Iran. Neither US official makes statements on their visit on Wednesday. The day before, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said that the US officials will convey to the Russians their concerns about Russian cooperation with Iran. Reeker stated, "We'v e consistently urged Russia to cease all nuclear cooperation with Iran... Contributing to Iranian nuclear weapons ambitions would be counterproductive ... to Russia's broader strategic interests."
Alexander Rumyanstev, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, says that Russia will continue its nuclear cooperation with Iran in spite of US officials' calls not to do so, and that the Bushehr plant will come on stream by the end of 2003. Mr. Rumyanstev states that Russian experts will remain in Iraq until the completion and activation of the Bushehr power plant, and he reiterated that Russia has signed a protocol to import the used nuclear fuel from Bushehr back to Russia.
US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham says that during his meetings in Moscow on Wednesday he urged the Russians to end all nuclear cooperation with Iran. He states, "we consistently urge Russia to cease all nuclear cooperation with Iran, including its assistance to the reactor in Busheir." Secretary Abraham accuses Tehran of "aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction."
US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham states after his meeting with Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian Nuclear Energy Minister, "The expansion of Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran remains an issue of utmost concern to us. It has been raised to the highest levels, we are in the middle of sensitive discussion on this matter. ... We have long been concerned that Iran's only interest in nuclear civil power, given its vast domestic energy resources, is to support its nuclear weapons program. For that reason, we have consistently urged Russia to cease all nuclear cooperation with Iran, including its assistance to the reactor in Bushehr." ... Iran according to Abraham was "aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons as well as [other] weapons of mass destruction."
US Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has not ruled out the use of military sanctions on Iran should it not comply with the 31 October IAEA deadline.
US General Anthony Zinni predicts that Iran will have a nuclear capacity in five years. He says that this capacity, combined with Iran's long-range missiles that are capable of delivering nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons, "will be a more significant problem than Iraq....In the longer term, Iran is a greater threat."
US General Anthony Zinni, commander-in-chief of US Central Command, says, "I think [Iran] will have nuclear capability in a few years."
US intelligence analysts allege that Iran has sought weapons-related nuclear equipment and experts from Ukraine. Both nations have denied the allegations.
US intelligence officials claim that North Korea is exporting missiles to Iran by air because one of the North Korean ships that were loaded with missiles was intercepted in December on its way to Yemen. The officials add that six Iranian cargo air crafts have been spotted leaving Sunan airport in Pyongyang since April. They believe the planes contained disassembled Rodong missiles, similar to the missiles that North Korea exported to Pakistan in 1998.
Alexander Rumyantsev told a press conference in Novouralsk says "our plants have the capacity to manufacture equipment for just six nuclear units over the next ten years." He also mentions that economic and political factors have an impact on Russian Iranian atomic cooperation.
US intelligence reports that at least four subsidiaries of the Czech company Skoda, among them Skoda-Praga and Skoda-Plzen, were negotiating with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy regarding the Bushehr atomic power plant. However, the Czech subsidiaries back out under US pressure.
US intelligence sources of Iranian and Iraqi exile groups are deemed "questionable." Former IAEA weapons inspector David Albright says, "There is a drumbeat of allegations, but there's not a whole lot of solid information. It may be that Iran has not made the decision to build nuclear weapons. We have to be very careful not to overstate the intelligence."
US intelligence sources say that China is selling nuclear technology to Iran in violation of a pledge given one year ago to halt missile sales to the Middle East. Jon Kyl, the ranking Republican on the Senate Sub-Committee on Technology, says that China is providing Iran with the technology to use nuclear warheads on missiles
US intelligence sources say that the Russian Research and Planning Institute for Power Supply Technologies (NIKIET) and another research institute, probably the Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology, are negotiating for the construction of a 40MW heavy water research reactor in Iran.
US military officials in Iraq notify the IAEA that its inspectors will be barred from entering the Tuwaitha nuclear research center when they arrive in the country next week. Moreover, according to the IAEA, the inspectors will eventually be permitted to perform only the minimum extent of checks required by international law, which amounts to conducting an inventory of one small area at the center where radioactive material was stored before the war. The inspectors will not be permitted to conduct an investigation of public health claims linked to the looting of nuclear materials from the center, nor will they be involved in the hunt for weapons of mass destruction.
US National Security Advisor Samuel Berger announces US sanctions against three Russian entities for aiding Iran's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. The entities are the D. Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology, the Scientific Research and Design Institute of Power Technology, and the Moscow Aviation Institute. "The administration has authority to act against entities that violate nonproliferation standards," Berger says, "and we will use that authority to protect our security. In the end, though, the most effective shield against proliferation from Russia is not US penalties, but a Russian export control system that is designed to work and does." Twelve Russian corporations and institutes are barred from buying US goods, exporting to the United States, or selling to the US government because they have aided Iran's weapons programs. Yevgeniy Primakov, the Russian Prime Minister calls the action "counterproductive to US-Russian relations." A statement from the Russian Ministry of Foreign affairs defends the companies by saying that their actions were consistent with Russian legislations and Russian obligations in the international agreements of non-proliferation.
US News and World Report reports that North Korea and Iran have an agreement to develop nuclear weapons. North Korea reportedly is to sell Iran unspecified numbers of nuclear weapons as well as designs for nuclear weapons plants, in return for Iran giving North Korea $500 million for the development of ballistic missiles that could reach Japan.
US News and World Report reports that Pakistan is helping Iran build a plutonium reactor.
US News and World Report reports that, according to Iranian exiles residing in Europe, Iran has constructed a clandestine site to develop nuclear weapons inside a mountain tunnel, close to the city of Chalus on the Caspian Sea. The exiles claim that Iran has employed technicians from the former Soviet Union, China, and North Korea at the site. [Note: The article contains a small map indicating the location of the alleged nuclear weapons facility.]
US News and World Report reports that, according to unnamed European intelligence sources, Iran is trying to construct mine shafts in preparation for conducting nuclear tests. The shafts, which are several hundred yards deep, will make the detection of these tests more difficult. Iran is obtaining the technology to build the shafts by saying that it needs the technology to improve the Kazd [Yazd] uranium mines. Although Russia has assisted Iran with the mining project, the intelligence sources believe that Russia has not disclosed "all its advanced technology" on the subject. According to the sources, Iran is attempting to acquire the technology through industrial espionage.
US newspapers report Russia has promised to provide Iran with a centrifuge that will allow it to make nuclear weapons. The New York Times and Washington Post report that an agreement was reached in January 1995 in which Russia will sell Iran a centrifuge plant. Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, says such allegations are completely false, stating, "We will not give Iran or any country nuclear weapons capability or technology." The Washington Post reports that the United States is strongly opposed to all aspects of the secret protocol between Russia and Iran, but is especially concerned about the inclusion of uranium enrichment technology. Reports say that meetings on the subject with high-level Russian diplomats, including Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, have revealed that the centrifuge plant sale was still under consideration in Moscow. According to US officials, the Russian government seems divided between the Atomic Energy Ministry, which expects a large profit from the roughly $1 billion sale, and the Foreign Ministry, which is anxious to improve US-Russian relations.
US officials claim that China and Pakistan are aiding Iran in the development of a nuclear bomb.
Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian atomic energy minister, says that a Russian delegation will fly to Tehran to discuss the delivery of nuclear fuel to the Iranian nuclear reactor in Bushehr.
US officials express concerns over Russia's training of hundreds of Iranian technicians and scientists in complex nuclear processes in various Russian academic institutions.
US officials say Iran needs eight to ten years to develop a nuclear bomb
US officials say Russia has notified the United States that it will go ahead with the export of up to four nuclear reactors to Iran, ignoring US requests to cancel the deal because of proliferation concerns. US State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns says Russian leaders could not "have failed to understand our position...[that any sale would] be a very serious issue." An aide to Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee Chairman Mitch McConnell says McConnell is "actively considering" preventing approval for a proposed $250 million in economic aid to Russia for FY 1996 on account of the reactor agreement. However, the Nunn-Lugar program, whereby the United States provides funding for the dismantlement of Russian nuclear weapons, would not be affected by the move. The Clinton administration opposes linking the reactor deal with economic aid, arguing that the reactor deal promises much greater economic rewards [to Russia] ($1 billion) than the aid package.
US officials say that nuclear cooperation was discussed when South African Energy Minister Pik Botha led a delegation to Iran in March 1995, although intelligence sources have indicated that South Africa has not given Iran any nuclear technology or information. [Note: See 19 and 20 August 1995 entries for Botha's admission that discussions included a plan to supply Iran with uranium.]
US officials say that the Bush administration is considering a Pentagon plan to destabilize Iran's powerful clergy through covert action. The administration officials are exploring ways to enhance public uprisings to diminish the influence of the religious Mullahs in Iran.
US officials say they "accepted China's word" that China has discontinued a 1992 deal to supply two 300MW reactors to Iran. [Note: See 27 September 1995.] According to Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project On Nuclear Arms Control, suppliers often include additional "sweeteners," such as uranium enrichment technology, plutonium processing technology, or small research reactors in a contract for nuclear reactors, but now the United States can be certain Iran will not receive such technology from China. Milhollin says China had also considered exporting a 30 to 50MW research reactor to Iran that could be used in a nuclear weapons program. Milhollin theorizes that China's cancellation indicated that Iran could not pay for the deal and that it got a better offer from Russia.
US officials say they are prepared to impose sanction on Russia for allegedly aiding Iran develop nuclear weapons.
US President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin reach an agreement in which Russia will ban nearly $1 billion worth of arms exports to Iran in exchange for access to export markets and US financial assistance. Yeltsin indicates that Russia will fulfill its previous commitments to Iran, but it is not clear whether the 1992 Russian agreement to provide two nuclear reactors and 170 technicians to Iran will be terminated.
US President Bill Clinton imposes sanctions on seven Russian companies accused of selling weapons technology to Iran. The companies accused of wrongdoing believe such sanctions are "perplexing" since "they have always operated in accordance with Russian legislation."
US President Bill Clinton tells Russian President Boris Yeltsin that Iran is following a blueprint for acquiring nuclear weapons provided by Pakistan more than four years ago.
US President Bush and Russian leader Putin meet to discuss the Iranian nuclear weapons program.
US President Bush announces that Russia has proposed international inspections, possibly by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), of the nuclear plant it is helping build in Iran to assuage US fears that the facility might help Tehran produce atomic weapons. Bush says that Russian President Putin will put pressure on Iran so that it allows international inspections of its Russian-made nuclear reactor.
Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian Atomic Energy Minister, says that Russia may launch the Bushehr nuclear power plant by the end of 2003. He states, "aside from the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant, Russia has no nuclear programs with Iran... we do not plan to close this project, and we will bring it to the end."
US President Bush exclaims that the world must unite to denounce Iran's nuclear weapons program. UN inspectors find highly enriched uranium in Iran this same day at a second site there. The trace elements were said to be enough to "supply the fissile material for a nuclear bomb."
US President Clinton signs an executive order imposing an even tighter embargo against Iran, "banning virtually all US trade and investment" with Iran. [Note: See 30 April 1995 entry for Clinton's announcement of the embargo.]
US pressure may be the reason for China's decision to cancel a supply of small nuclear energy reactors to Iran. It is not clear whether China will supply Iran with a uranium hexafluoride production plant, used for uranium enrichment.
US satellite images show early construction stages at the site of a research reactor to be supplied to the Isfahan nuclear research complex by China under a June 1990 contract. A US official says the allegation, stemming from the Mojahedin-e Khalq, is "not true" since US satellite imagery "shows nothing on the ground, except for what Iran has declared to the IAEA." [Note: See February 1992 for the IAEA visit to the construction site. Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
US satellite photographs show major construction on a plutonium production plant and a large number of Chinese technicians at Isfahan. [Note: See 21 January 1990.]
US Secretary of Defense William Cohen reveals that the United States has bought 14 nuclear-capable MiG-29 aircraft from Moldova to prevent their sale to Iran.
Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian atomic energy minister, says that Russia may supply nuclear fuel to Iran on the condition that the fuel be returned to Russia for reprocessing.
US Secretary of Defense William Perry says Russia is helping Iran build up its nuclear capabilities. Russian officials reply that Iran's nuclear technology is similar to that in 25 other states and is the same type of reactor the United States in selling to North Korea.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell meets with his Russian counterpart Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and voices concern about an Iranian nuclear plant that is under construction. A senior US official stated that Russian Foreign Minister responded to Secretary Powell's concern and promised to look into the matter. More so, the senior official dismissed a Washington Post suggestion that the United States may pre-emptively strike the plant to stop it from becoming operational in two to three years.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell says that Russia and the United States are still in disagreement concerning the transfer of sensitive equipment to Iran.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell suggests that the US has intelligence that confirms Iran is "actively working" to enable its missiles to carry nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, Iran is moving forward on its plan to run 50,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium, to meet the fuel requirements of a nuclear reactor set to be finished next year. Iran is thought to currently possess less than 1,000 centrifuges; experts say that the addition of another 500 will produce enough weapons-grade uranium to produce a bomb annually.
US Secretary of State Colin Powell warns Russia against its continuous WMD assistance to Iran. He says that the United States is highly concerned by the Russian nuclear assistant to Iran. Mr. Powell warning comes after Russia shipped a cylindrical reactor to Iran.
US Secretary of State Collin Powell states that the United States does not plan to take military action to stop Iran's nuclear programs. Mr. Powell says, "We are concerned about what Iran is doing (with its nuclear program)....We will work with the international community to persuade Iran they should not move in this direction....But it's not a matter for the armed forces of the United States at the moment."
US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asks Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov for a Russian commitment not to provide assistance to Iran's nuclear and missile programs. Possible US actions against Russia include suspension of projects such as the Nunn-Lugar program, which provides increased safeguards to Russia's nuclear program. Albright invites Ivanov to Washington in April 1999 to meet with US President Bill Clinton.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov discuss Iran's purchase of two nuclear reactors from Russia. Primakov reassures Christopher that Russia is "also concerned about Iran developing weapons of mass destruction" and "does not want to enhance Iran's [nuclear] capacity."
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher says Russian President Boris Yeltsin does not know the details of the agreement between Russia and Iran for construction of a nuclear power plant. Christopher says Yeltsin has been misled by his advisors about the deal. [Note: Christopher may be referring to the additional protocol to the agreement, which included provisions besides construction of the plant.]
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher says, "Based upon a wide variety of data, we know that since the mid-1980s, Iran has had an organized structure dedicated to acquiring and developing nuclear weapons." He says that in the "organization, programs, procurement, and covert activities, Iran is pursuing the classic route to nuclear weapons which has been followed by almost all states that have recently sought a nuclear capability."
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher says, "With respect to the Iran nuclear situation, the Chinese foreign minister indicated they were not going forward with that particular transaction for various reasons, and that seems to be where the matter now rests."
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher states that the Iranian-Russian nuclear deal should not go forward because Iran is a sponsor of international terrorism. He says that the United States might discontinue aid to Russia if the contract is implemented. According to US officials, Iran is now the "biggest potential nuclear threat in the developing world."
US Secretary of State, Colin Powell says, "We never asked Russia to not build the plant at Bushehr. That's strange. When I was in the Clinton administration, we told the Russians, and more than once, not to build that nuclear power plant in Iran. When they persisted, we pushed them to narrow the scope of their cooperation. In this we succeeded." The stalemate between U.S. and Russia over Iran has prevented them from working together on projects that may inhibit proliferation.
US State Department official Richard Boucher states that Iran's testing of the Shahab-3 poses a threat to the Middle East and to US interests in the region.
Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian atomic energy minister, says that Russia will train 100 Iranian engineers to operate at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He adds that the nuclear plant will be operational in 2004/2005 and the next six years will be a transitional period. During this period, Russian and Iranian expert will run the facility.
A Congressional Research Service report says that China provides nuclear reactor and technology assistance and C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran.
US state department officials confirm Pakistan's claim that it is not providing assistance to Iran's nuclear program. Richard Boucher states at a Washington briefing, "We do believe that Pakistan takes this (nuclear) responsibility seriously."
US State Department spokesman Adam Ereli says, "If Iran fails to take those steps by the deadline [of October 31], that would constitute further evidence of its ongoing efforts to conceal its clandestine activities." Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Ali Akbar Salehi, accuses the United States of "having territorial ambitions in the region" and claims Iran will not accept any deadlines as it is a sovereign country.
US State Department spokesman James Rubin "expressed confidence" that South Africa would not assist Iran in developing nuclear weapons. Rubin said the United States was aware that Iran was actively seeking nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. However, he said "The United States has high confidence in South Africa's commitment to its obligations under the (Nuclear) Non-Proliferation Treaty not to assist efforts of any other countries, including Iran, to acquire nuclear weapons."
US State Department spokesman James Rubin says that China must halt all nuclear cooperation with Iran. Rubin also says that if China hoped to receive any nuclear technology assistance from the United States, Beijing must even stop supplying Tehran with equipment that is allowed under international treaties. This issue is stalling negotiations between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and US President Bill Clinton on an agreement on peaceful cooperation between Beijing and Washington. This agreement will be discussed during a summit meeting on 29 October 1997.
US State Department spokesman James Rubin says the United States wants China to make "clear and unequivocal assurances" that it will not give nuclear weapons technology to Iran.
US State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns says the 100 Russian advisers provided to Iran to develop its nuclear technology capabilities could be used to build nuclear weapons.
US State Department Spokesperson Christine Shelly says that in spite of US opposition to Russia's agreement to sell nuclear reactors to Iran, the Clinton administration is committed to continued aid to Russia. According to Shelly, linking US aid to Russian actions would be "counterproductive" to accomplishing the main goal of US aid, which is "to support Russia's transition to a democratic government and to a market economy." Speaker of the US House of Representatives Newt Gingrich has stated that the United States should end aid to Russia if it follows through with supplying the nuclear reactors to Iran.
US Undersecretary for International Security Lynn Davis says that Iranian nuclear procurement is "inconsistent with any rational civil nuclear program." The CIA has concluded that Iran's nuclear program is in its "infancy stage," but that Iran could possess nuclear weapons by the year 2000.
US Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Affairs Lynn Davis discusses arms control issues with Chinese officials in China. She meets with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. Davis raise the issue of Chinese assistance to Iran and Pakistan. China gives a formal pledge that it will pull out of a project to build a hexafluoride plant in Iran. [Note: See 6 January 1997.]
US Undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs Lynn Davis says that the United States will press the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls' [COCOM] successor regime, which will be formed once COCOM is dissolved on 31 March 1994, to halt transfers of dual-use and military technology to Iran.
US Undersecretary of State John Bolton mentions that Russia's support for Iran's nuclear program could undermine a $20 billion US-led effort to help dismantle the former Soviet Union's military arsenal. He also states at a Senate hearing that Russia's cooperation with Iran is complicating US efforts to rally international support for President Bush's 10-year plan to contain and destroy Russian chemical and nuclear weapons stocks.
US Undersecretary of State John Bolton says, "I think what will happen prior to October 31st is the Iranians will cooperate a little bit and the issue will be, 'Did they cooperate enough?'"
US Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis declares that the United States is convinced that Iran is attempting to steal nuclear technology and materials to develop nuclear weapons. Iran is "many years away" from possessing a nuclear weapons capability, but stealing nuclear technology or material "can reduce the time dramatically in terms of developing a weapon," Davis said.
US Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis reports that US intelligence indicates that scientists from the former Soviet Union have gone to Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, where they may be assisting in the development of nuclear weapons. Davis says that the migration of former Soviet scientists is hard to document and that she does not have details on the number of scientists or the actual work they are performing. According to Davis, the United States cannot prevent scientists from migrating where they want and selling their expertise, but it does "have better control on items and trade."
US Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis says Iran "continues to purchase" nuclear reactors from Russia and China. Davis says that the United States has been pushing for an agreement with Russia to ban arms sales to Iran. According to Davis, Russia is committed to fulfilling its current contracts with Iran, but has agreed to ban future arms sales. As an incentive for this agreement, the United States has offered support for Russian membership in a new policy coordinating organization that seeks to control sensitive exports. The European countries are willing to admit Russia into this new regime in spite of Russian arms sales to Iran. "Maintaining their political relationship with Russia and their reluctance to single out Iran have been given priority over their non-proliferation goals," Davis said.
US Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Sergey Kiriyenko discuss Russia's cooperation with Iran regarding nuclear technologies. Gore says the United States would like to see Russia cease cooperation with Iran in building the Bushehr nuclear power station, which he believes could be used in military applications. Russia asserts its decision to provide assistance to Iran does not violate the nuclear and missile nonproliferation regime, and that all technological expertise was for peaceful purposes.
Alexander Rumyantsev, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy denies, media reports that Iran no longer has an interest in cooperation with Russia. He stated, "We have met with the Iranian delegation. The Iranian vice-president and the chairman of the Commission on Atomic Energy, Gholam Rea Agazadeh did not [say] anything like this either in a meeting with us or at the plenary session....[O]n the contrary, the Iranians publicly declared at the session that their nuclear activities are completely open and invited all IAEA member states to cooperate in implementing ambitious plans to create 6MW nuclear power plants in about 20 years."
US Vice President Al Gore says he wants Russia to cease cooperation with Iran over the building of Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. Viktor Chernomydrin, Russia's prime minister, who met with Gore in Washington the day before, reasserts his country's position that its dealings with Iran are of a peaceful nature.
US Vice President Al Gore says the United States may install economic sanctions on Russia if its assistance to construction efforts at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran continues. Israel at the same time continues to lobby the US Congress for similar sanctions, and has made tentative announcements to halt plans to purchase Russian oil. Viktor Chernomydrin, Russia's prime minister, labels such attempts as "stupid," in light of the International Atomic Energy Agency's continued affirmation that work on the Bushehr plant is within the rules established by the Agency, "We have obligations (to Iran), we are fulfilling them and we will not break them, even if that is what some would like. But it seems that the Americans do not want to stop running the bogey of 'seeking nuclear bombs' against Iran."
US Vice President Dick Cheney says Iran is developing weapons of mass destruction.
Uzbek President Islam Karimov says he disapproves of Russia's deal to sell nuclear reactors to Iran.
V.V. Krotov, general director of Atomredmetzoloto, says Iran asked his company to study Iran's potential for mining uranium. Krotov says Iran has two uranium deposits, but they would require a 300-meter-deep mine and would not be worth mining anywhere else in the world. This would only produce about 50 tons of uranium a year, he says, while the Bushehr plant would need three times that. Krotov says his company agreed to modify Iranian designs for a mine and a uranium-enrichment plant. "But there was no contract," he says, "only a protocol of intent to conduct negotiations." [Note: For more information on the protocol, see 5, 11, 17, and 18 May and 2 June 1995.]
Alexander Rumyantsev, the Russian atomic energy minister, says he is pleased by the US-Russia summit. Yet he acknowledges that Russia failed to eliminate US concerns over the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation. He says that the creation of a joint Russian-US group of experts constitutes an additional step towards the signing of a bilateral treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy. He adds that the construction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr does not mean the transfer of technologies to Iran and that the plant will be supervised for at least 10 years by Russia and will be subject to the same security measures in Russia.
Vaclav Klaus, prime minister of the Czech Republic, while on an official visit to Israel, says Skoda has done nothing wrong. Klaus dismisses the allegations as "rumors and speculations usually created by the competition in the Western European countries, in the United States' companies which want to catch the markets themselves and try in advance to send rumours to undermine the Czech position."
Valeriy Kondryatev, the technical director for the Leningrad Metal Factory, says the main parts of the turbine for the Bushehr nuclear power plant will be complete by December 2001.
Valeriy Lebedev, Russian deputy minister of atomic energy, says spent Russian nuclear fuel from Russian-built plants abroad will be returned to Russia. He says Russia is committed to finishing the Bushehr nuclear power plant in late 2004 or early 2005.
Valeriy Nesterushkinl, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman, says Russia will remain true to its commitment to complete construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. US opposition, he states, should have been lessened by Russia's disclosure of its plans and assurances that the nuclear power plant is "under the full vigilance and supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the peaceful purpose nature of the Bushehr's nuclear plant had been confirmed by IAEA."
Valery Lebedev, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, says that Moscow plans to complete the construction of the Bushehr nuclear plant by late 2004 or 2005. He reiterates that Russia will not cancel its contract with Iran despite US pressure.
Various Iranian leaders visit the Czech Republic to try to finalize a number of deals arranged by Al Haj Azimi, vice-president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and Akbar Itamad, technical advisor to the Iranian Supreme National Security Council. The leaders involved include Ayatollah Mohajirani, an advisor on nuclear matters to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Reza Amrollahi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and nuclear physicist Mahdi Chamran, head of the Iranian VAVAK intelligence services.
Various Iranian press agencies exclaim mixed feelings over leadership's decision to sign the additional protocol to the NPT.
Vassili Grornov, Russian Ambassador to Brazil, denies that Russia will sell nuclear weapons to Iran.
Vice President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Asadollah Saburi asserts in an interview with Reuters that the Bushehr project with Russia is about one-third completed. He says that approximately 700 Russian experts are currently working at Bushehr and in one year this number would increase to about 1,500. Saburi states that negotiations are underway between Iran and Russia on a second reactor: "We are after a new generation of enhanced-quality reactors for the new plant: a 1,000MW if in Bushehr and smaller ones if in another site, possibly two 640MW units."
Victor Kozlov, director-general of Atomstroyesksport, says that Iran will decide on the construction of a second nuclear reactor in Bushehr by the end of this year. Iran will also choose the site for two new nuclear reactors in few months.
Victor Kozlov, director-general of Atomstroyesksport, visits Iran to coordinate the Bushehr project. Atomstroyesksport signs contracts with Iranian subcontractors. It will soon start the installation of the already supplied material.
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, announces Russia will not violate international agreements by providing Iran or any other nation that is in violation of the current international regime with missile or nuclear technologies.
Viktor Kozlov, director general of Atomstroyeksport, says Russia and Iran are discussing building another nuclear power plant in Iran, and that Russian has given Iran a feasibility study of possible locations. [Note: See 4 September 2001.]
Viktor Kozlov, general director of Atomstroiexport, which serves as the marketing arm of Russia's atomic energy ministry (Minatom), emphasizes that the design of the Bushehr nuclear plant and Russia agreement with Iran to import the used fuel render the Bushehr project harmless. Mr. Kozlov says "Russia in principle is not interested in the proliferation of nuclear weapons... Russia is cooperating in the construction of the power plant here because it is absolutely sure that that is not the situation."
Viktor Kozlov, head of Atomstroiexport, says that his company will seek fresh contracts with Iran. He brushes aside US concerns that the reactor could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Mr. Kozlov states, "Russia is convinced that the plants it builds in neighboring counties are used only for civilian purposes....You should n't think Russian leaders are stupid."
Viktor Mikhailov, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, says 20 to 40 Iranians will be trained in Russia.
Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, proposes to US Energy Secretary Federico Pena that the two countries establish a joint system of controlling the Bushehr nuclear power plant "to dismiss all suspicions from the part of the United States about Russia's giving out nuclear technologies to Iran." This he believes will assuage US fears by allowing it to monitor administrative aspects of the plant, while at the same time policing how nuclear fuel elements in the reactors are serviced during refueling.
Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, says Moscow will continue to develop the 1000MW nuclear power plant in Bushehr, Iran. He says that the project is monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and will be completed on schedule. Russia may sign an agreement to construct another 1000MW reactor and two 440MW reactors in Iran.
Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, says that Iran does not possess "the scientific and technological potential necessary and sufficient," to manufacture nuclear weapons. Mikhailov refutes Benjamin Netanyahu's promulgations that Iran is attempting to build a nuclear weapon. Russia's Energy Minister further asserts that any transfer of information to Iran is solely for peaceful purposes, refuting reports that Russia is providing Iran with centrifuges used to manufacture weapons-grade material.
Alexander Rumyantsev, the Russian atomic energy minister, says that Russia will respect its agreements with Iran and will complete the nuclear reactor in Bushehr by 2004. He adds that the Bushehr project is similar to other projects Russia has carried out in China and India and that it is for purely peaceful purposes. Former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani says that Iran has never been interested in acquiring nuclear weapons.
Viktor Mikhailov, the Russian atomic energy minister, says that his office is very active in preventing the export of dual-use technology and materials from Russia's dismantled nuclear warheads. He assures that none have been sold to either Iran or any other country. He continues to say that Russia will continue to honor its commitment to Iran in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran reports both Mohammad Al-Baradi, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, the head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, met to discuss the need to establish a Middle East nuclear-free zone. Al-Baradi further emphasized the agency's desire to provide assistance to Iran in other areas of cooperation besides the Bushehr nuclear power plant such as health, agriculture, industry, and hydrology.
Vitaliy Konovalov, First DeputyMinister of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, saysMinatom has not signed any secret contracts with Iran for the sale of a uranium-enriching gas centrifuge. But he says Iranasked Russia to sell "nuclear high-technology" and to build a factory for producing nuclear fuel. "This request was specified in the protocol, which was signed by MinatomMinister Viktor Mikhailov following the result of one of his visits to Iran," Konovalov says. "This was merely Iran's request, and Russia did not assume any commitments." Konovalovsays Russia does not intend to sell a gas centrifuge to Irannor build a factory for producing nuclear fuel. "A country with one nuclear power station does not need such a factory,"he says, adding that such a factory would only make economic sense if Iran had at least ten nuclear power plants. Anunnamed Russian diplomat says Mikhailov did not secretly sign an agreement without permission of the Russian government, but rather merely signed the record of his January 1995 talks with Iranian officials in Tehran. But the diplomat says Mikhailov"displayed some autonomous actions because the issue of delivery of gas centrifuges, contrary to the issue of preparing [training] [nuclear] specialists, goes beyond the scope of the basic agreements signed with Iran in 1992." Thediplomat says Mikhailov probably did not have the approval of the Russian government for such an agreement. [The existence of such a protocol seems to contradict the 11 May 1995statement by Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic EnergyOrganization of Iran, that Iran never sought a gas centrifuge.It also seems to contradict the 12 May 1995 statement byGeorgiy Kaurov, head of the information directorate of Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy that Russia was never going to sell a centrifuge to Iran. See also 17 May 1995 entry for more on the protocol.] In an interview on Iranian television,Amrollahi says "there was no such thing called a centrifuge....What they have made such a hue and cry about is a pure lie and is merely a propaganda clamor to pretend thatClinton did not return empty-handed from Moscow....[Note: Thisis the same explanation given by the Iranian embassy in Germany. See 13 May 1995 entry.] Our agreement, which is abo uta power station, includes the fuel as well. Therefore, there was no fuel requirement for us to seek to enrich uranium....Our contract never included a centrifuge system."Amrollahi also says Iran plans to buy two 300MW reactors from China, the first of which will take seven years to build and install and the second eight years. [Note: See 21 and 30 May1995 for more information on Chinese nuclear cooperation with Iran.]
Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Russian State Duma International Affairs Committee, states that the nuclear deal between Russia and Iran does not violate a single international law, but he says President Clinton's decision to prevent the US oil firm Conoco from implementing a deal with Iran will make it more difficult for Russia to go ahead with the lucrative contract.
Vladimir Orlov, Director of the PIR Center for Political Studies, says that the Russian government has instructed institutes to limit contacts with Iranian scientists and that any training offered should be explicitly approved by the security services. Analysts from PIR say that the aim of Iran is to accumulate expertise to build nuclear weapons.
Vladimir Orlov, director of the PIR Center, a Moscow-based nongovernmental organization devoted to nonproliferation, says "it is our judgment that Iran has a certain interest in military nuclear research....It appears that Iran's research is not advanced and no political decision has been made in Iran in this field. It's just that they try to keep abreast with the events in order not to fall behind."
Vladimir Putin declares that Russia is determined to continue its nuclear cooperation with Iran, which will be subject to the supervision of the IAEA.
Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, states that cooperation between Russia and Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms to all international commitments of both countries. During a recent visit to Iran by Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov, an agreement was signed to accelerate the construction of a nuclear power plant in Bushehr and to discuss possible cooperation for building more nuclear power plants in the future. The agreement has been criticized by Israel, which claims it will compromise attempts to achieve peace in the region.
Vladimir Vinogradov, the Russian deputy atomic energy minister, says the first unit at the Bushehr nuclear power plant is now 80% complete. [Note: See 16 January 2001.] He says, "Russia has no complaints about how Iran is fulfilling its financial obligations."
Vladimir Yatsenkovskiy, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry spokesman, says no agreement exists between Turboatom and Russian on supplying turbines for the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran.
A criticality study is published of the low- and highly enriched uranium spent fuel from the Tehran research reactor. The study determines the best storage positions of the spent fuel in the cooling pool. According to one analyst, this study may mean Iran is considering research into reprocessing the spent fuel.
Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran reports that the partnership of Amir Kabir Technological University and the Atomic Energy Organization has produced its first X-ray tube using cobalt-57. The X-ray tube is designed to detect uranium.
Volodymyr Bronnikov, former director of the Zaporizhyzhya-based nuclear power plant, confirms that Russian and Iranian companies participating in the construction of Bushehr nuclear power plant approached him and Volodymyr Dudnyk, manager of the EnerhoDarBud construction company, about building an installation in Iran similar to the EnerhoDar site in Ukraine. Bronnikov says he refused the offer.
Waldo Stumpf, chief executive officer of South Africa's Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC), will require an end-user statement from China before a plant leaves South Africa, and that "China won't get any technology transfer," and assured that "this plant will not be re-exported to Iran." [Note: The "plant" probably refers to a zirconium-tube facility. See 18 December 1998.]
Waldo Stumpf, of the South African Atomic Energy Corporation (AEC), assures a US delegation led by Hazel O' Leary, US Energy Secretary, that South Africa will not provide nuclear weapons technology to Iran.
Washington Times columnist Stephen Green writes that Iran is close to acquiring a uranium enrichment capability because of Chinese assistance. With Chinese help, Green writes, Iran reportedly built a cyclotron uranium enrichment facility in Karaj, 25 miles south of Tehran, according to information from the National Council of Resistance of Iran (the Mojahedin-e Khalq). Iran has 10 locations devoted to nuclear activities, and may be building an eleventh site south of Tabriz with Chinese help, Green writes.
Welt am Sonntag of Hamburg reports that, according to Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND), Iran has a nuclear weapons development program. The report says Tehran will not have the technical capability to produce nuclear weapons until at least 2002, although that timeframe could be accelerated if Iran acquires weapons-grade fissile material on the black market.
Alexander Rumyuantsev, Russian Atomic Energy Minister, says that Russia had signed all the necessary agreements to import the radio active fuel waste from the Iranian Bushehr plant. He states, "We will return all the spent nuclear fuel, and it will not fall into anybody's hands but Russia's....now, we are completely legitimate."
Wen Wei Po of Hong Kong, a Chinese-owned publication, publishes a "special article" that reaffirms Beijing's position that Iran complies with international regulations and that therefore it is "entirely reasonable and legitimate" for China to provide nuclear reactors to Iran.
Western diplomatic sources say that the International Atomic Energy Agency plans to conduct an inspection of Iranian nuclear facilities during the first half of 2003 amid rising concerns of Tehran's nuclear capability.
Western diplomats claim Iran is producing uranium hexafluoride, which can be used to make nuclear weapons, days before its promise to halt such activities takes effect. Iranian officials deny allegations.
Western observers fear Pakistan may share its nuclear technology with other Islamic states such as Iran and Iraq. Pakistan is currently the only Islamic nation with the necessary components for a nuclear arsenal, and it has approximately five to ten weapons. Although Pakistan has told the United States that it will not share nuclear technology with other nations, Pakistan has already been implicated previously in transferring sensitive nuclear technology to Iran and Iraq before the outbreak of the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
When asked whether Iran is pursuing a nuclear bomb, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani tells CBS's 60 Minutes, "absolutely not. We hate that weapon." The CBS correspondent then asks if Rafsanjani would "swear by Allah." Rafsanjani replies, "there's no need to take an oath. We are a frank people. We make missiles and we tell everybody that our missile industry is strong. But we're not after nuclear bombs and we won't go after biological and chemical weapons." Rafsanjani says that nuclear energy is necessary to help meet Iran's electricity needs, and that the technology was originally supported by the United States when the Shah was in power.
While in Russia for negotiations with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, Revolutionary Guards General Sardar Shafaq defects to the United States. [Note: The Revolutionary Guards reportedly control Iran's nuclear weapons program.]
Alexander Yakovenko an official spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that Russia's position with regard to its atomic energy cooperation with Iran remains unchanged. Mr. Yakavenko states, "the 'long-term programme' for the development of trade, economic, industrial and technological cooperation between Russia and Iran for the period of up to 2012 mentions only the existing potential possibilities, the implementation of which depends on many factors, including political of course." He reiterates that Russian-Iranian cooperation in the sphere of Atomic energy "is of a peaceful, mutually advantageous character, which is in full conformity with all international commitments undertaken by Russia, above all in the sphere of nuclear non-proliferation."
While in Washington, DC, Efraim Sneh, Israeli transportation minister, says he is certain "the central support for the Iranian nuclear project is provided by Russia."
While Iranian diplomats met with EU officials in Paris to find a compromise on Iran's nuclear program, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated that Iran is not seeking nuclear weapons. Khamenei claims that US accusations are unfounded and "aimed at preventing Iran's technological progress."
While on a trip to the United States, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak says that Iranian nuclear weapons would threaten Arab security. But he says, "We do not think the Iranians are seeking that goal. We got clear assurances from the Russians, during the recent visit of the Russian Foreign Minister to Cairo, that the nuclear reactors Iran wants to buy from Moscow would not be aiding Iran in the production of a nuclear bomb."
While on his first visit to Pakistan, Iranian President Mohammed Khatami states that Iran does not want nuclear weapons and would prove it by sending Bushehr's spent fuel rods [a potential source of fissile material] abroad for reprocessing. He mentions, "we have no problem with sending the nuclear waste and uranium waste to other countries....We are not insisting on keeping them in Iran, where they could also pose an environmental problem."
While speaking to reporters in Bushehr at the plant construction site, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Aleksandr Rumyantsev mentions that he received a confirmation from Iran that there are no differences over the wording of the nuclear fuel supply contract. Mr. Rumyantsev also states that he was satisfied with the progress in the construction work and the plant's readiness for the installation of technological equipment. He also tells ITAR-TASS that he was satisfied with the preparation of the storage facility for nuclear fuel that will be supplied to Iran in the middle of next year. Iran declares that it is going to increase its security at the Bushehr plant. Ali Shamkhani, Iranian Defense Minister, promises that any attack against the Bushehr plant would result in a strong and resolute military response.
White House press secretary Scott McClellan says the Bush Administration wants to see the Iranian nuclear weapons dilemma "resolved through the diplomatic efforts of the Europeans. We want to see it resolved in a peaceful way." Vice Admiral Lowell Jacoby tells the Senate Armed Services Committee that "Tehran probably will have the ability to produce nuclear weapons easily in the next decade."
White House spokesman Mike McCurry stated that the strengthened US embargo against Iran will help to persuade Russia to cancel the reactor deal. Moreover, McCurry says that since the announcement of the trade embargo, other G-7 nations have begun reviewing their policies toward Iran.
Alexander Yakovenko, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, states on CNN, "The position of Russia on cooperation with Iran in the nuclear field remains unchanged. This cooperation bears an entirely peaceful and mutually beneficial character and is fully consistent with all the international obligation of Russia, primarily in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. The whole activity of Iran in the nuclear field as a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is under the control of the [International Atomic Energy] Agency, which, as is known, has identified no violations by Iran of its obligations. At the present time we are collaborating with Iran in the construction of a nuclear power plant in Bushehr and in the ensuring of its nuclear safety. As to the prospects of cooperation with Iran in the field of peaceful uses of the atom, the Long-Term Program...speaks only of the available potentialities..."
William Cohen, US Secretary of Defense, on a tour of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf says, "Iran foreign policy has not changed," and it continues to try to acquire nuclear weapons.
Wolfgang Hoffman, the executive secretary of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, says that legal problems have prevented Iran from sending data to the organization. [Note: See 26 March and 15 April 2002.]
Work will begin on the first reactor at Bushehr in one month, according to the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry. [Note: A report on 6 September 1995 said work had already begun, but have been only feasibility studies and assessments of the site.]
Xinhua reports that South African Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs Penuell Maduma says that South African uranium export policy was discussed at a meeting with Iranian officials In South Africa.
Yadernyy Kontrol of Moscow reports that Iran has several nuclear installations: a 5MW TRR light water reactor supplied by the United States, which uses 20% enriched uranium that Iran gets from Argentina; a zero-capacity heavy water reactor; a neutron source using 90% enriched uranium; a light water training reactor of subcritical capacity; and a graphite training reactor of subcritical capacity. All but the 5MW reactor were supplied by China.
Alexei Yablokov, chairman of the Russian Security Council's commission on environmental security, says rumors of energy shortages are fabrications to justify the building of reactors such as the one at Bushehr. Yablokov asserts that Iran is rich with "immense oil and gas resources, so it could have only military reasons for wanting the power station."
Yediot Aharonot of Tel Aviv reports that Russia agreed to provide Iran with knowledge regarding the production of heavy water, which can be used to build specific kinds of nuclear weapons. Israeli sources reporting the matter, state "If the Iranians can acquire on the black market a quantity of fissile material used to make nuclear bombs, it will accelerate their timetables." This report further states that Russian assistance may make it possible for Iran to develop not only nuclear capabilities, but chemical and biological as well.
Yediot Aharonot reports that intelligence sources say that Iran has crossed the point of no return in the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Western efforts to prevent Iran from such acquisition have failed. These sources say that it is only a matter of time and Iran will have a nuclear weapon.
Yediot Aharonot reports that Israel and the United States received information that a Russian company is selling centrifuge parts for uranium enrichment to Iran. Israel has given to Russian President Vladimir Putin documents proving the involvement of some Russian entities in selling such equipment to Iran. President Vladimir Putin responded, "Your scientists must be mixed up. This is not equipment for centrifuges but aluminum parts for the construction of airplanes." A source in the Israeli prime minister's office said, "The documents in this file are so conclusive that it is clear that Putin is lying or that he was deceived by his men." Israel and the United States believe that the Bushehr complex, given its immensity, can hide plutonium separation plant even if the reactor itself is under IAEA supervision. Russians are also believed to be training Iranian engineers and physicists in a research center in Moscow and in a nuclear power plant in Novovoronezh.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russian minister of atomic energy, rejects comments by Viktor Mikhailov, former Russian minister of atomic energy, that Russia might stop nuclear cooperation with Iran. Admanov says Mikhailov's remarks do not represent the thinking of the Ministry of Atomic Energy and that they stem from Mikhailov's failure to "develop" the Bushehr nuclear power plant project while he was minister.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, reports that Russia "is stepping up" work on the nuclear power plant in Bushehr, Iran, which now includes over 300 Russian specialists.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, says construction will begin this year on the first reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. He says the first unit is between 30 and 40% complete. He says Minatom is negotiating a deal to build a second unit at Bushehr. He says a joint Russian-Iranian team of technicians is being formed to run the plant and should be formed by 2000 or 2001. One thousand Russians are now working at Bushehr, and more will work there this year, he says.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russian minister of atomic energy, says that Russia has proposed that the United States lift all sanctions imposed on two leading Russian nuclear research centers in exchange for the complete cessation of the centers' cooperation with Iran. [Note: See 12January 1997.] The aim of the proposal is to reinstate valuable contracts between the United States and the institutions. Adamov proposed signing a separate agreement for each institution: one for the Scientific Research and DesignInstitute of Energy Technologies (NIKIET), and one for th eD.I. Mendeleyev Russian Chemical-Technological University.NIKIET was preparing a contract to sell a research reactor to Iran, but the Russian government decided not to sell the reactor. A US expert said that NIKIET was the focus of USconcerns, because it is the principal Russian entity that could have provided assistance beyond the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The D.I. Mendeleyev RussianChemical-Technological University provided unclassified information on heavy water technologies to Iran. According to a senior US official, Adamov allegedly has Prime MinisterPrimakov's support for putting forward the proposals. UnderAdamov's proposal, a procedure would be established to resolve future disputes regarding the provision of Russian nuclear technology to Iran. The US Department of Energy has been so worried about the safety implications of the sanctions that it secretly appealed to the White House, asking that some exceptions be made so that important safety work could go forward, a US official said.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister confirms that Russian plans to finish construction of the Bushehr electric power station within 55 months of signing of the contract in January 1995. Asadollah Saburi, vice president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and Adamov agree that US opposition to the construction will not have a negative effect on completion of the Bushehr electric power station.
Al-Hayat reports that, according to Russian Counterespionage Agency statistics, about 12% of applied physicists and 40% of highly qualified theoretical physicists have emigrated from the former Soviet republics, in particular from Russia. A recent Labor Institute poll indicated that 40% of former Soviet scientists might be willing to emigrate, and 13% are prepared to do so immediately. The report says such emigration could aid Middle Eastern or Asian countries in the acquisition of nuclear weapons and delivery systems.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, and Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, discuss the bilateral contract for constructing the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Russian experts believe preliminary estimates of the cost of the project need to increase by $50 to $100 million to compensate for delays and Iran's mismanagement of the project. The two officials also discuss the "implementation of the contract, specifically questions of the transfer to the Russian side of full volume of work under the turn-key principle, with simultaneous employment of Iranian subcontractors."
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, describes the relationship between Tehran and Moscow as "strategic and excellent," reminding the international community that any nuclear relationship between Russia and Iran, such as the Bushehr nuclear power plant project, "poses no danger."
Ali Aghamohammadi, spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security Council, dismisses the reports of U.S. commandos carrying out reconnaissance missions on Iranian territory as "psychological warfare." The Teheran Times referred to the story as a "ridiculous bluff." Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani earlier stated that Iran did not fear attack, "we can claim that we have rapidly produced equipment that has resulted in the greatest deterrent." IRNA quotes former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying "We are not afraid of foreign enemies' threats and sanctions, since they know well that throughout its Islamic and ancient history, Iran has been no place for adventurism." The Mehr news agency, with ties to Ali Khamenei, boasts that Iran "is prepared to attack any intruder with a fearsome rain of fire and death."
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, says Iran and Russia will discuss improving the work efficiency of the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran. Adamov calls work thus far on the plant faulted and having only begun in earnest once Russia "assumed the implementation of a turn-key project," which the Bushehr contract became after contractual renegotiations.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, says Russia will continue its work on the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Adamov further says that despite attempts by the United States to monopolize the nuclear technology market, Russia will continue to seek opportunities in this field.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, says work on Iran's nuclear power plant in Bushehr is moving at a brisk pace. Adamov reports over 1,500 people are being used to complete the project, which now includes the building of a second power unit.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Minister of Nuclear Energy, in a meeting with Hassan Habibi, First Deputy President of Iran, says "Iran's plans for a developing healthy nuclear energy resources are wise." Adamov further states Iran's efforts to develop peaceful uses for nuclear technology would be augmented by Russian assistance in the way of nuclear energy development and safe disposal of nuclear waste.
Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Nuclear Energy Minister, says it is not possible for nuclear technology used in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran to be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Adamov says the reactor "can under no circumstances be used for military purposes."
Yevgeniy Adamov, the Russian Atomic Energy Minister, reconfirms Russia's intention to continue work on the nuclear power plant in Bushehr, Iran. In response to accusations from the US government, Adamov assures that Russia "does not accept double standards in the sphere of cooperation with non-nuclear countries. We proceed from the fact that Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and is ready to make its facilities available for oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency."
Yevgeniy Adamov, the Russian Atomic Energy Minister, says Russia is working on a feasibility study for constructing a second reactor at Bushehr. [Note: See 13 June 2001.] The first reactor is 90% complete, he says, though it is not slated to go into operation until 2003. [Note: See 27 June 2001.]
Yevgeniy Adamov, the Russian Minister for Atomic Energy, confirms that Gholam Aqazade, the President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, is invited to Moscow in May to discuss organizational matters pertaining to the construction of the Bushehr nuclear energy plant. Adamov hopes to establish a new contract with Iran regarding the construction of a research nuclear reactor. This reactor, Adamov affirms, can be delivered with uranium enrichment less than 20%, a level the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would find acceptable. Adamov further promises to continue "cooperation in nuclear power engineering with Iran."
Yevgeniy Mikerin of the Russian Ministry of Nuclear Power Engineering says the Bushehr nuclear power plant will receive fuel from a chemical plant based in Novosibirsk. The plant makes fuel cassettes for Chernobyl-type VVER-1000 reactors that will be built in Bushehr. The plant will begin making the fuel a year before the Bushehr reactor will begin operation. He adds that this order will allow the plant in Russia to maintain its personnel and increase productivity.
Yevgeniy Primakov, Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service Director, says the United States need not worry about Iran's supposed nuclear weapons program. According to Primakov, "After considering voluminous material, we have concluded that Iran at present does not possess nuclear weapons...nor any evidence of the existence in that country of a coherent military nuclear program." US concerns stem from growing reports of Iranian attempts to procure nuclear technology. Primakov counters such assertions by saying Iran would have great difficulty in developing a weapons program even if its supply to information went "unimpeded."
Yevgeniy Primakov, Russia's foreign minister, assures Yusuf Bin-Alawi, state minister on Foreign Affairs of Sultanate of Oman, that Russia has not provided Iran with information to aid it in the construction of nuclear weapons. Primakov states, "I want to say with the whole responsibility that Russia does not implement any state projects with Iran. According to our information, there is not leakage of any data which could help Iran to create nuclear weapons..."
Yevgeniy Primakov, Russia's foreign minister, says, "Russian does nothing through governmental or non-governmental channels to help Iran to acquire mass destruction weapons and long-range ballistic missiles." The remark comes in response to Israeli concerns regarding the trade relationship between Russia and Iran.
Yevgeniy Primakov, the Russian Foreign Minister, elaborating on the nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran, says that the nuclear reactors sold to Iran are only to be used for civilian purposes, and adds that they are similar to the reactors that America sells to North Korea.
Yevgeniy Reshetnikov, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, says "major construction work" will begin this year on the first reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Seven hundred eight Russian specialists are working at the site, he says, and the first reactor should be finished by the end of 2003. [Note: A recent report said the project would be finished in February 2003. See 30 January 2001.]
Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Iran's President, says Iran does not have a nuclear arms program. The report comes from the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), which recently reported on the President's visit to a research center for agriculture and nuclear medicine where he denounced Western propaganda as an attempt "to deprive Iran of the enormous benefits of nuclear science."
Yevgeniy Reshetnikov, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, says the light water nuclear reactors Russia is building in Iran cannot be used to make weapons-grade uranium or anything else of military value. He also notes that the reactors are under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency. He says the project to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant is "making brisk progress," and that the plant should be in operation in four years.
Yevgeniy Reshetnikov, Russian Deputy Atomic Energy Minister, says the reactor and turbine equipment will be delivered to the Bushehr nuclear power plant shortly, and construction of the "first block" will begin this year.
Yevgeniy Reshetnikov, Russian deputy minister of atomic energy, denies the existence of any financial problems preventing the completion of the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Yevgeniy Reshetnikov, Russian deputy minister of atomic energy, says Russia has made a "technical and commercial proposal" to Iran for the construction of a second unit at the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Yevgeniy Reshetnikov, the Russian atomic energy minister, says he is sending a delegation to Iran with a completed feasibility study for construction of additional reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. "Iran can order the construction of at least one more reactor," he says. Contract negotiations for the additional reactors could start in December, he says. He also says a steam generator was delivered to Iran in July for the first unit and the reactor will be delivered in November.
Yevgeny Adamov, the Russian Minister of Atomic Energy, says that the Russians have started the construction of another nuclear reactor in Iran. He said that Russia doubts that Iran will use this facility for the production of nuclear weapons. Adamov also says that 90% of the work on a nuclear reactor has been finished in the city of Bushehr and that the reactor will be completed in two years.
Yevgeny Reshetnikov, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, says that Iran "cannot and will not use for any ends enriched nuclear fuel" from the Bushehr reactor. The fuel will be shipped back to Russia.
Yitzhak Mordechai, Israel's Defense Minister, meets with Chinse President Jiang Zemin, who promises China will not provide Iran with nuclear technology that could be used to manufacture missiles.
Yitzhak Mordechai, Israel's defense minister, proclaims the Muslim states of the Middle East represent the greatest threat to stability in the region. Iran specifically is singled out by Mordechai, who proclaims, "The biggest threat in this context comes undoubtedly from Iran, which strives to assemble missiles capable of reaching any target on our territory and to manufacture its own nuclear weapons." Mordechai further states Iran's desire to attain nuclear weapons must be countered by a strong Israeli response.
Yitzhak Mordechai, Israel's Defense Minister, says he believes Iran is "determined to manufacture long-range ballistic missiles capable of striking Israel, the Gulf states, Asia and parts of Europe. This is a real danger...We know an Iranian nuclear weapons manufacturing program is going on with help from Russian scientists."
Ali Akbar Salehi, Iranian Representative to the IAEA, says that Iran has always been in favor of the Additional Protocol on inspection of nuclear sites. He adds that only 50 members of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) have signed the additional protocol, and it has been ratified in only 27 countries. Mr. Salehi adds that the Head of the IAEA should not speak as a spokesman for the US administration.
Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, "emphatically" asks Josef Zieleniec, Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic, not to provide nuclear power components to Iran. Zieleniec denies that any exports to Iran could be used to aid in the development of nuclear weapons. Skoda Plzen, a Czech company with experience building nuclear power plants, recently admitted having discussions with Iran regarding "supplies of parts from a nuclear power plant."
Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, says allegations made by the newspaper Maariv that Swiss companies are providing information and supplies to Iran for its nuclear program are false, stating, "The newspaper does n't know what it is talking about." [Note: See 25, 30 June 1993.]
Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister of Israel, says Israel is concerned with German firms' attitude toward continuing nuclear trade with Iran. Israel cites Germany's recent objections to placing economic sanctions on Iran at a G-7 meeting, as well as a rescheduling of $5 billion worth of debts owed by the Iranian government. Israel believes Germany is so inclined to do business with Iran that it may risk chastisement from the rest of European Community and the United States to make money.
Yunes Masumzadeh, the deputy director of Self-Sufficiency Jihad, the Iranian Ground Forces wartime organization, says that Iran only seeks nuclear power for energy purposes and not to acquire weapons. He adds that the country's research centers are not active in regards to nuclear weapons.
Yuri Fedotov, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, expresses Moscow's desire to broaden its ties with Tehran. He states, "Iran-Russia relations is one of the issues constantly discussed between US and Russian officials....Moscow is still interested in broadening cooperation with Iran and is determined to continue developing mutual ties in various fields."
Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's chief IAEA delegate, acknowledges past mistakes in reporting nuclear activities, adding however that the NPT additional protocol would be ready to sign within two weeks. Salehi also acknowledges that the promised moratorium on Iran's uranium enrichment program has yet to take effect. An unidentified senior State Department official says that Washington expects the pending IAEA report to support the U.S. position that Iran has engaged in an advanced program to produce nuclear weapons.
Yuriy Savelyev, former dean of Baltic State Technical University, denies allegations of military cooperation with Iran. In accordance with the bill on nonproliferation recently passed by the US Senate, the university was classified in March 2000 as an establishment promoting proliferation by educating Iranian students in the field of nuclear energy. Savelyev, who was forced to resign due to these circumstances, confirmed that Iranian students studying at the university were specializing only in civilian applications.
Yuriy Vishnevskiy, chairman of the Russian Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety (Gosatomnadzor), says Russia will send its first group of nuclear and radiation inspectors to the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran "next September." He says that Iran requested the inspectors' assistance because it has no nuclear safety specialists of its own. [Note: See 6 July 1997.]
Zeev Schiff writes in an article in Haaretz that Israel's "window of opportunity" is at risk of shutting if it ignores the proliferation of nuclear technological endeavors taking place in the Middle East. He states that countries like Iran will inevitably transfer their technology to other nations and will cause an arms race in the region. Washington's resolve to limit Tehran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon is no longer palatable and its ability to discern whether a nation is nuclear capable, something it failed to due prior to India's detonation of a nuclear device, is no longer adequate. Schiff believes lack of transparency among Pakistan, India, and other nations in the region will cause a "guessing game" that will threaten the region's stability. He concludes that "although the dangers are great, Israel will probably stick even more firmly to its nuclear policy now that Pakistan has the bomb and now that the prospects of Iran going nuclear have increased."
Zhongguo Kexue Bao reports that the Azad University in Tehran reported to the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Plasma Physics that the HT-6B tokamak provided to it by the Institute performed a successful 20 millisecond discharge. This is China's first international transfer of nuclear fusion research technology. The tokamak, a small fusion research apparatus, was built in the mid-1980s by the Institute and was operated for 10 years before its installation in Tehran in 1994. China and Iran intend to conduct joint research in nuclear fusion.
Zhu Rongji, China's Prime Minister, confirms to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, that China will not provide nuclear and ballistic missile technology to Iran. This promise comes as a result from China's 1995 agreement with the United States to reduce cooperation with Iran.
Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's former IAEA envoy, has said that "Iran's decision to master the nuclear fuel cycle is completely clear and irreversible" and it would be counterproductive of the Europeans to reach a deadlock in the nuclear talks, as they would gain only a two-year moratorium on Iranian nuclear activities and lose face internationally.
Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's representative to the IAEA, claims that Iran does not consider itself bound to the 31 October deadline, as it has not formally accepted the resolution; however, Iran still intends to cooperate with the IAEA and give answers as quickly as possible.
Ali Akbar Velayati, foreign minister of Iran, says Iran has no interest in acquiring chemical or nuclear weapons. He says that as the head of the international Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has frequently stated, Iran is not attempting to produce nuclear weapons.
Ali Akbar Velayati, Iranian foreign minister, and Yevgeniy Primakov, Russian foreign minister, sign a Memorandum of Understanding on export controls. Primakov says the document will "serve a very noble cause, the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and corresponding technology throughout the world." He also reiterates Russia's commitment for the completion of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr and says they will maintain their ties and act in accordance with international standards.
Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's Foreign Minister, warns an arms race in the Middle East could precipitate a global war. Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reports Iran has remarked on its adherence to the principles of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, stating it is Israel not Iran that is suspected of having a nuclear arsenal of 200 warheads, and it is Israel, because of its arsenal, that creates tension in the region.
A delegation from Syria arrives in Iran to begin negotiations on a possible Iranian-Syrian nuclear pact.
Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister of Iran, in an interview with Iranian television declares that the budget the Iranian government allocates for defense is almost less than that of the regional states of the Persian Gulf, and thus shows that the accusations leveled by the United States are unfounded. They reiterate that Iran is an active member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and are signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Ali Akbar Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, speaking at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, expresses his concern over the continued existence of nuclear weapons and adds that their elimination poses the greatest challenge to the new era. He also encourages the relevant states to sign and accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in a timely manner.
Ali Aqamohammadi, head of the Information Dissemination Department of the SNSC, stresses that Iran will consider the Paris Agreement "null and void" if the Europeans "fail to adopt a transparent stance" in tomorrow's talks.
Ali Khurram, Iran's United Nations envoy in Geneva, states his country's opposition to the development of nuclear weapons in the Asian continent. Khurram stresses his country's adherence to the peaceful use of nuclear technologies and warns that India's weapons test risk heightening the arms race between India and Pakistan.
Ali Reza Jafarzadeh, the representative of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, an Iranian rebel group accuses the Iranian government of building two secret nuclear sites, a nuclear production plant and research lab at Natanz and a heavy water production plant at Arak. He says, "These two nuclear sites have been kept secret until now." NCRI is accused by the State Department of being the same group as Mujahedin-e Khalq, which killed several US citizens in Iran during the 1970s. Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman said, "it's a terrorist organization. It's listed as such, designated as a foreign terrorist organization under US law."
Ali Shamkhani, the Iranian defense minister, says that the delay of his visit to Russia is a result of the presence of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in Moscow. He adds that the Iranian defense ministry postponed the visit and that it will take place at the appropriate moment. He also says that the pressures from other countries will not influence the relations between Russia and Iran.
Ali Shamkhani, the Iranian Defense Minister, warns Israel against attacking the nuclear plant in Bushehr. He adds that the retaliation to such an act will be unimaginable. He also dismisses reports that Iran received shipment of enriched uranium-235 from Russia.
Ali Shirzadian, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says that claims of an Iranian nuclear weapons program reported in USA Today are "sheer lies" and that such accusations are part of a US plot against the Islamic world. Shirzadian says that Iran is an active member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and has been faithful to its commitments as a signatory to the [Non-Proliferation Treaty]."
A delegation of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Power is visiting Iran to discuss the construction of Bushehr and nuclear cooperation.
Ali Vahid Khorram, advisor to the Iranian Foreign Minister, says that Iran favors a Persian Gulf and Pacific region free of weapons of mass destruction.
Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesperson for the Mojahedin-e Khalq of Iran, the largest Iranian anti-government opposition group, tells a news conference that the government in Tehran has increased the nuclear development budget from $200 million in 1991 to $800 million in 1992, and are therefore "coming closer to obtaining a nuclear bomb." He adds that according to the intelligence gathered by supporters of his group inside Iran, the plant that China has agreed to supply is intended to complete a nuclear center at a military base in Darkhovin, which is one of five nuclear sites in Iran. He also says that work on the nuclear program is running in conjunction with efforts to further the biological and chemical programs. [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
Al-Shab of Cairo reports that Iran has been able to "steal or secretly buy" two nuclear weapons. The report also says that unnamed US sources say there are 200 specialists and 2,000 researchers working in the nuclear field in Iran.
Al-Shab of Cairo reports that the United States has completed a military plan to strike Iran. Based on the confessions of suspects who outlined Iranian involvement in the Al-Khobar bombing that killed 20 American, the US strikes are planned for terrorist training centers around Tehran as well as Qom and Nahavand. Strikes are also planned for industrial, chemical, and nuclear installations in Tehran, Khark, Isfahan, Bandar-e-Khomayni, and at missile bases in Shahrawand, Shiraz, and Bandar-e Abbas. Iran warns that any attack on it will destabilize stability in the whole region.
Al-Sharq Al-Awsat of London reports that Iran and France have signed a secret agreement on nuclear cooperation. Under the agreement, France will supply Iran with enriched uranium. The United States is concerned by the deal, and is expected to request a full explanation of the secret agreement. During the Shah's rule, Iran signed a nuclear agreement with France that Iran later invoked in requests for French enriched uranium. France hesitated to comply due to the possible military applications of the enriched uranium. Contract disputes between the two states also led to a 12-year financial dispute wherein Iran demanded that France repay a $1 billion loan.
Al-Sharq Al-Awsat of London reports that the United States is investigating a ring smuggling uranium and plutonium to Iran and Iraq from Ukraine. The ring was discovered when Bulgarian customs arrested on 29 May a Kurd named Hanafi Yukazan with a container of highly enriched uranium.
Al-Sharq al-Awsat reports that the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) has in its custody an Iranian Embassy employee accused of attempting to obtain documents relating to the manufacture of nuclear weapons. This is the third such incident, according to the FSB. [Note: The November, 14 November, and 17 November 1997 entries probably refer to the same arrest.]
Al-Sharq of Doha reports that during the Shah's rule, Iran "conducted studies and research in the nuclear field in violation of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty." The report assumes "remnants" of past nuclear weapons design activity are still present in Iran, and says "it is possible that Iran has unassembled equipment, radioactive materials, and other devices it had bought." The report also states the 1991 Persian Gulf war may have convinced Iran of the need to obtain nuclear weapons for deterring any future aggression against it. However, because Iran gives the development and modernization of its army a higher priority than its nuclear weapons program, future nuclear weapons production will be "difficult to achieve." The report concludes: "Allowing Iran to obtain the technology for the production of nuclear weapons will not serve Russia's interests."
Although the Clinton administration has called for a total embargo of nuclear technology on Iran, China and Russia agree to sell nuclear facilities to Iran in 1994, while other nations such as Japan and Germany continue to sell Iran high-tech dual-use technology. Israel is concerned that Iran may acquire key nuclear components from the former Soviet Union, thus shortening the predicted eight to ten years Iran is expected to need to be able to produce nuclear weapons.
Ambassadors from France, Britain, and Germany have released an official statement calling on Iran to halt all uranium enrichment activity in exchange for nuclear technology, access to nuclear fuel, increased trade, and assistance with regional security concerns. Meanwhile, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has stated that Iran is prepared to reach an agreement regarding its nuclear program, as long as Iran's right to peaceful nuclear technology is recognized.
American President George Bush tells the Europeans he wants to make sure the negotiations with Iran continue and offers his assistance to help move the process forward.
Amid concerns that Iran will acquire dual-use technology and use it to develop nuclear weapons, the United States is urging other countries not to sell such technology to Iran. US officials say that they are concerned that Iran may try to obtain items such as centrifuges and high-speed computers that can aid in the development of nuclear weapons. The United States is sharing information with other countries concerning Iran's procurement network.
A delegation visiting Iran from the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM) discusses the use of Russian technology for uranium extraction in Iran, possibly through joint ventures. The delegation also discusses the schedule for equipment deliveries for the reactor Russia will supply Iran under an August 1992 agreement. In considering the fuel supply for the reactor, the two sides raise the possibility of Russian involvement in prospecting for uranium deposits in Iran. The Russian team includes Atomredmetzoloto (formerly the "raw materials main administration" of the Ministry of Medium Machine Building) President Vyacheslav Krotkov, Chemical Technology Research Institute Deputy Director Boris Laskorin, and Zarubezhatomenergostroy (an independent state foreign trade association that was also previously part of the Ministry of Medium Machine Building) packaged deliveries department head Sergey Kulikov. MINATOM officials refrain from commenting on the results of the discussions.
Amin Tarzi, a senior analyst at the Center of Nonproliferation Studies, says, "The Iranian nuclear program is in shambles and the people who read all the intelligence know that."
Amir Hossein Zamani Nia arrives to Moscow for discussions with officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry on issues of mutual interest. Alexander Yakovenko, spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, expresses hope that cooperation between Russia and Iran in economic and commercial fields would increase in the future. When asked about the statements of the US ambassador that Iran may use its nuclear cooperation with Russia for military uses, Mr. Yakovenko said that this claim is not important, and the important thing is that Russian officials have repeatedly declared their views on the subject stressing that nuclear cooperation between Moscow and Tehran is not military.
Amnon Shahak, Israel's chief of staff, states in an interview with Qol Yisrael that he believes Iran does not currently possess nuclear weapons, but warns if Iran does acquire nuclear weapons in the future, it will represent a major threat to the stability of the region.
Amr Musa, the Arab League's secretary general, decries the hypocrisy of singling out Iran for its alleged nuclear weapons program while ignoring Israel's weapons of mass destruction.
An Agence France Presse report says that the Swiss are major suppliers for Iran's nuclear weapons program. The report adds that at least 10 companies have exported materials and equipment that could be used to produce nuclear chemical and biological weapons, as well as long-range missiles. The Hebrew language newspaper The Daily Maariv says that Switzerland possesses high technology, loose and legal export controls, and the inclination to sell. Maariv adds that because there is no 'end-user' provision in Switzerland, firms can sell parts through intermediaries. The paper also says that Swiss exports to Iran almost doubled in a span of three years. [Note: See 28, 30 June 1993.]
An analysis by the Christian Science Monitor during the week of Iran's Military Parade claims Iran and the United States are engaged in supportive "quiet discourse," despite the hostility between the two countries.
An anonymous Israeli intelligence official says that Iran has had difficulties with its nuclear weapons program, and will not have an atomic bomb "until the middle of next decade." The official partially credits efforts by the United States to limit the supply of nuclear technology into Iran. The Central Intelligence Agency assesses that Iran will have an atomic bomb by 2007, revised from a 1992 estimate that Iran would have such a weapon by 2000. Mustafa Kibaroglu, a Turkish nuclear proliferation expert, says Iran will not have a "high-quality nuclear weapon" for at least 15 years. Israeli and Turkish analysts believe that it will take at least an additional five years for Iran to develop small and reliable weapons that can be delivered by missiles or aircraft.
An anonymous source has told the Russian News &amp; Information Agency (RIA) that there is thus far no evidence of Iran having worked on nuclear weapons and that IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei is expected to confirm this in his final report on Iran to the Board of Directors at the end of the month.
An Anti-Defamation League (ADF) report says the United States is inadvertently aiding Iran's nuclear weapon program by supplying it with more than $650 million a year in computers and "other federally listed nuclear relevant technologies." The report also states Iran's ability to purchase dual-use technologies has been bolstered by increasing US purchases of Iranian oil. The US Department of Commerce says any dual-use technology sent to Iran is carefully scrutinized by the Departments of Energy, State, and Defense, which calls the checks "adequate and rigorous."
An article in Yedi'o t Aharonot presents details of Ariel Sharon's proposal that Israel pay off its debt owed to Iran in order to ease tensions between the two countries. Also revealed are details of secret talks between Sharon and Russia concerning Gazprom efforts to sell natural gas to Israel. Sharon proposed that Gazprom buy the Israeli debt from Iran and then allow Israel to settle with the new owners. Much controversy surrounds this proposal, with the Defense Ministry worried about Sharon's initiatives. The Gazprom deal has been put on hold, as have other projects between Russia and Israel.
An Austrian company completes a cyclotron, which can be used to enrich uranium, at Iran's nuclear research center in Karaj. The cyclotron, listed in a secret deal as "medical equipment," violates European Union trade sanctions against Iran. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) issues a statement on 27 February 1997 denying that Iran was pursuing a uranium enrichment capability. The AEOI reportedly runs a number of front companies in Vienna, Austria, to buy components for Iran's nuclear weapons program. [Note: See also 23 February 1997.]
A diplomat close to the International Atomic Energy Agency confirms Iran has requested to "expand quality control checks and maintenance of 'nonessential' enrichment centrifuge parts to 'essential' centrifuge parts that have been sealed by the [IAEA] under the [uranium enrichment] suspension."
An Azeri news outlet, quoting "credible sources" in Moscow, says the reactors for Bushehr will be shipped from Russia to Iran through Armenia.
An editorial in the Tehran Times says that the Iranian Foreign Ministry should file official protests with countries in the Third World that accuse Iran of attempting to acquire nuclear weapons. Specific reference was made to a British television report of 8 March 1993, which declared that Iran is attempting to acquire nuclear weapons, technical assistance, and nuclear weapons materials from Kazakhstan.
An IAEA team visits several Iranian nuclear sites and reported having seen nothing to suggest Iran is developing nuclear energy for non-peaceful uses. Several countries noted that they were not convinced the IAEA visit was absolutely conclusive.
An International Atomic Energy Agency delegation visits the Moallem Kalayeh facility located in the mountain near the city of Qazvin and reports that the facility is a recreational center for the nuclear industry staff and not a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facility.
An Iranian construction worker is irradiated by Iridium-142 at the Gilan combined-cycle gas plant near the city of Rasht. The Iranian authorities state that the Rasht power plant is not a nuclear power plant, but confirm that the accident has occurred. The worker found the unshielded Iridium, which had been misplaced for about two hours, and "carried it to another part of the construction site." Iridium-142 is used in the X-ray testing of welds.According to Hamshahri, a Tehran city government newspaper, 50 people were exposed to radiation, seven of whom were engineers from the German firm Siemens. The German fir mis participating as part of a European consortium in construction of the Iranian facility. The paper also reported that the incident resulted in the hospitalization of 21people. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran denies the reports, referring to testing results that showed that only the one worker was injured. According to a press release issued by Siemens, no German workers were injured. Accordingto "Western intelligence experts," the "radiation incident"occurred at the secret Neka nuclear facility near the CaspianSea. Unnamed Iranian reports cited in London's SundayTelegraph believe the Neka facility is part of Iran's nuclear weapons development program. A Siemens' press release discounted the allegations, saying "there is no operating nuclear power station in Iran." [Note: See 31 July and 2August 1996.]
A diplomat familiar with the IAEA, who asked not to be identified, says Iran is "pouring the concrete foundation" at the Arak reactor after the IAEA asked Tehran to refrain from building the reactor as a "confidence building measure" in September.
An Iranian delegation led by Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, visits the St. Petersburg Yefremov Electrophysical Apparatus Scientific Research Institute (EASRI) to "familiarize [Iran] with the scientific work of EASRI and to [sic] search for a 'common ground' in Russian and Iranian research." Vasiliy Glukhikh, director of NIIEFA, says that the institute conducts fundamental and applied research in fields specified in the agreement. These fields include controlled thermonuclear fusion, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and the production and application of radioisotopes and laser technology. Glukhikh also says that the goal of the visit was a search for "common ground" in Russian and Iranian research.
An Iranian delegation of scientists and technicians go to China and North Korea to discuss buying nuclear and missile technology, according to Iranian exile sources. One reason for the trip, according to Middle East Defense News, was to show France that Iran could find another source of uranium. [Note: See 8 July 1991 for France's refusal to give Iran access to enriched uranium.]
An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that Iran has successfully conducted the final test of its Shahab-3 (shooting star) medium-range missile. This missile was first tested in 1998 and possesses a range of 810 miles. It is widely believed that the Shahab-3 was built with North Korean assistance; however, the Iranian government claims that the missile relies entirely on Iranian expertise. Due to its range, the Shahab-3 is capable of reaching Israel and Saudi Arabia. [Note: It is also capable of carrying an unconventional warhead.]
An Iranian nuclear energy official announces that the startup of the Bushehr reactor will be delayed approximately one year, until 2006.
An Iranian official denies knowledge of any deals with Argentina for fuel cycle facilities or a research reactor. The Iranian official also said that the only nuclear agreement Iran had with Argentina called for the supply of nuclear fuel for the 5MW research reactor at the Tehran Nuclear Research Center.
An Iranian official states that Iran has completed the feasibility studies and preliminary investigation regarding the construction of a second nuclear power plant in Bushehr. Mr. Ahmadi adds, "We hope that after the allocation of the necessary funds, the contract for the new power plant will be concluded before the inauguration of Bushehr power plant at the latest."
A document by the Minority Staff of the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations states that the "southern tier" countries of the former Soviet Union (i.e., the Caucasus and Central Asia) should receive greater attention from a counter-proliferation standpoint. According to the statement, Armenian scientists commonly emigrate to Iran, and representatives of North Korea, Iraq, and Iran traveled to Uzbekistan in 1992 to recruit nuclear scientists. The statement mentions reports of nuclear scientists being pulled off a plane bound for North Korea. The statement also contains a copy of an advertisement by the Hong Kong Sun Shine Industrial Company that offers the services of former Soviet weapons experts "willing to work in a country which needs their skills and can offer reasonable pay." The statement reiterates Schweitzer's call for expansion of joint peaceful scientific projects between the United States and former Soviet Union.
An Iranian radio station reports that Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said Iran would open three more yellowcake milling facilities in addition to the one at Saghand. Two sites were identified as Bandar-e Abbas and Bandar-e Langeh.
An Israeli minister and US Vice President Al Gore discuss Russia's transfer of missile technology to Islamic regimes. A Russian military expert warns Russia's government that exchange of nuclear and missile technology with Iran could undermine Russia's future security.
An Israeli newspaper reports that Iran is receiving nuclear weapons development assistance from nine western firms.
An Israeli spokesman says that a Western-led coalition will begin a strike to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear capability. He says that the attack will be on Iran's secret nuclear installation in Neka, 100 k m Northeast of Tehran. These remarks come following some reports about Chinese experts expected in Tehran to begin construction on a new uranium enrichment plant. [Note: See 17 and 18 April 1996.]
An Italian judge confiscates parts deemed to be for nuclear reactors. The judge states that these parts can be used militarily and that they were meant to reach Iran. The parts are from the German company Siemens, whose spokesperson says that the steam generators that were confiscated are 16 years old and were supposed to be put into storage. Italy, along with most Western states, usually does not ship or transfer materials of such nature that can be used for military purposes. The steam generators were brought to the port of Marghera from Milan a couple of months ago. The Siemens spokesperson states that the generators were built in Italy in 1977 for the use in the reactor project in Iran. [Note: See 11 November 1993.]
An official for Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry says that the next stage in development of Iran's nuclear power plant in Bushehr will begin in the second half of 1998. Approximately 750 Russian specialists will work on the reactor. Iran will send power plant staff to the Kurchatov Institute and the State Scientific Center (Postatov) in Russia for training. The plant is expected to be finished in 2001 as part of a $780 million contract with Russia.
An official of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) says a joint Chinese-Iranian team had been formed to prospect for uranium in eastern Iran. [Note: See 17 April 1996.] The exploration team is searching for deposits in the provinces of Yazd, Khurasan, and Kerman. In addition to sizeable uranium deposits, Iran has plants for processing ore into uranium yellowcake, and may be constructing a uranium hexafluoride plant with Chinese assistance. Iran has imported chemicals used to make uranium hexafluoride, a chemical used for enrichment, from both China and Russia. A Chinese delegation was scheduled to be sent to the Isfahan nuclear complex to work on the final design phase of a uranium hexafluoride plant. [Note: See 17 April 1996.] Iran intends to declare this plant to the International Atomic Energy Agency for monitoring. Some intelligence sources believe a pilot "hex" plant was constructed several years ago at Rudan, near Shiraz, with Chinese assistance.
An official who saw the calutron provided to Iran by China says that the Iranians have met with difficulties in operating the calutron at "design current," although other reports say Iran could reverse-engineer the calutron. Another report indicates the calutron has not yet been installed.
An unattributed official of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry says Russia will not cancel its contract to build the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran, because it "will in no way enable that country to accumulate weapons-grade nuclear materials."
An unidentified Western diplomat divulges that HEU has been located at sites other than Natanz and Kalaye, raising further questions regarding Iran's bomb-making ambitions.
An unknown US source, reportedly with longtime connections to the Israeli government, gives both the CIA and Israel Iranian government documents on Iran's successful efforts to obtain nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union. [Note: For more on this topic, see 9, 10 (2 entries), 11, 15, and 16 April 1998. 1991, 13 October, December, and 27 December 1991 entries may also be related.]
An unnamed high-ranking Russian diplomat denies that the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which will meet 29-30 June, will make a secret agreement for when Russia will end military cooperation with Iran.
An unnamed high-ranking Russian diplomat says Russia's nuclear deal with Iran does not pose a military threat. "This deal is being strictly controlled by the Russian special services, whose duty is to ensure the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons," he says. "Naturally, Moscow does not intend to tolerate any loopholes for the spreading of nuclear threat."
An unnamed official of the Russian atomic energy ministry says that Russia has yet to receive Iran's agreement for Moscow to import back radioactive fuel waste from an Iranian nuclear power plant that Russia is building in Bushehr. The official states that a new clause to the Russian-Iranian accord on Bushehr project "has been presented to Iran....As soon as Iran makes a judgment on documents concerning the return of spent nuclear fuel, the clause will be added to the agreement."
A feasibility study shows that it would be possible to convert Iran's 5MW nuclear research reactor from highly enriched uranium to low-enriched uranium (LEU). Future studies will be conducted to compare the possible loadings for the LEU core. These studies will need to consider the economics of such conversion and the increased handling of uranium that it will entail.
Anatoliy Bugayets, director general of the Ukrainian Turboatom company, says the failure of Ukraine to participate in construction of the nuclear power station in Bushehr will cost more than the previously quoted $45 million possibly costing Ukraine $450-$500 million. Ukraine may lose the Iranian market entirely, a fact Bugayets reports could have significant repercussions. Turboatom was to build a turbine or turbines for the plant. [Note: See 6 March 1998.]
Anatoliy Buhayets, Ukraine's Turboatom nuclear power plant manager, reports that Turboatom lost approximately $260 million in a deal that it had with Iran. Under the deal, Turboatom would have supplied turbines to a nuclear power plant in Iran. However, the United States pressured Turboatom to cancel the sale. Buhayets said that the United States should compensate Turboatom for the lost revenue.
Anatoliy Minchenko, Ukraine's minister for industrial policy, says that Ukraine wants to promote cooperation in "nuclear power engineering" with Iran. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Hennadiy Udovenko, did not mention the sale of turbines for the nuclear power plant near Bushehr, Iran. [Note: See 16 April 1997 and 26 July 1997.] Ukraine's Kharkiv Turboatom company had planned to sell Iran the turbines, but the United States has been very vocal against the deal.
Anatoly Zhilinskiy, the head of the Tehran office of the Russian nuclear power construction company Zarubezhatomenergostroy (company for nuclear power engineering abroad), says that the biggest impediment to its work in Bushehr is the lack of technical documentation from the previous German company that had begun work on the nuclear power plant. He says that under the Russian-Iranian nuclear agreement, Zarubezhatomenergostroy must complete the Bushehr nuclear power station using Russian machinery. However, Iran requested that the Russian company keep German equipment already installed, some of which has no technical supporting documents. According to Zhilinskiy, Zarubezhatomenergostroy is "not authorized to use technical equipment without relevant documentation," and if the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) fails to obtain these documents, the Russian company would be forced to "remove" the German machinery. Zhilinskiy states that Russia has already submitted a construction proposal to Iranian officials for building a new nuclear power plant in Iran. However, Iran is not likely to consider the proposal until the Bushehr nuclear station is completed.
Andrei Gagarinsky, director of Russia's Nuclear Physics Research Institute, says that the institute is in negotiations with Iranian officials for the training of Iranian nuclear technicians. Several dozens of Iranians are to train in Russia at a cost of $2000 per month, and training is expected to range from a few months to several years.
A few days after IranianForeign Minister Kamal Kharazi's visit to Russia, the RussianAtomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov, is abruptly removed from his position. Official sources state that Mikhailov asks to leave his position so he can concentrate on scientific research. Speculation is that he is removed due to disputes over his suggestions for broadening nuclear cooperation with Iran. Two days later, Yevgeniy Adamov is appointed as the new Minister for Nuclear Energy. Adamov is the former head of the Research and Development Institute of Power Engineering, where he developed a program in nuclear safety. Last month he accompanied Mikhailov to Tehran to meet with Iranianofficials. US officials are concerned over the appointment ofAdamlov, but he has assured those same officials that he has no intention of helping Iran develop nuclear weapons. However,later in the week he announces that Russia plans to sell several more nuclear reactors to Iran. That same day, Ukraineannounces that it will cancel plans to supply turbines for theBushehr reactor. In response, Russian officials say that Russia could build the turbines itself at a factory near St.Petersburg. US officials say that the plant would have to be retooled first, adding further delays to the Iranian nuclear project. Later in the month, Mikhailov emerges as First DeputyMinister of Atomic Energy and boasts that 1,000 Russians will be in Iran by the end of the year building the first of several nuclear reactors. He also says that he has recommendedYevgeniy Adamov as his successor because of his strong support of the type of reactor being built in Iran.
Andrei Illarionov the top economic advisor to Russian President Putin, implies that further work on Bushehr hinges on Iranian acceptance of additional inspections by the IAEA.
Andrei Nikolayev, head of the Russian State Duma Commission for Defense Affairs, says that the Iranian-Russian relations are strong. He adds that the US allegations of the Bushehr nuclear reactor possibly being used for military uses are baseless, because Iran has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Andrey Gagarynskiy, the director of foreign relations of the Kurchatov Science Institute in Moscow, says that Russia and Iran are examining training programs for the engineers who will be operating the nuclear power plant in Bushehr. He adds that the two countries will soon be signing an agreement to this end.
Andrey Kokoshin, Russia's Security Council Secretary, concludes his visit to Israel by assuring Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of Israel that Russia is not supplying nuclear technology to Iran to be used for nuclear missile development. Natan Sharansky, Israel's Trade Minister, states he has proof of Russian-Iranian cooperation regarding dual-purpose nuclear technologies, which Israel may provide to the United States if Russia does not force its military-industrial companies to cease its work with Iran. Netanyahu states that the Russian government should "intensify 'a dozen times over' its work on preventing the leakage of nuclear and missile technologies to Iran."
Andrey Kokoshin, the Russian National Security Council Secretary, Sandy Berger, the US National Security Adviser, and Natan Sharansky, Israeli Cabinet Minister, meet in Moscow to discuss the transfer of missile and nuclear technology to Iran from Russian companies. A separate meeting reportedly takes place between Sharansky and Kokoshin, in which Sharansky pushes for stricter measures to be taken against Russian companies accused of providing nuclear weapon technology to Iran.
Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's Foreign Minister, says inspections conducted recently by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) prove the "peaceful nature" of Iran's nuclear program. Kozyrev says Moscow will expand its nuclear relationship with Iran, citing the IAEA report as proof of Iran's good conduct in the nuclear field.
Anton Khlopkov, a Russian security expert, says that the Russian technology transferred to Iran in the construction of the nuclear power plant in Bushehr cannot be used for the development of nuclear weapons.
Appearing on a morning MSNBC program, U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney notes that Iran is "right at the top of the list" of the Bush administration's list of trouble spots worldwide and raised the specter of a preemptive Israeli attack on Iran "if the Israelis became convinced the Iranians had significant nuclear capability." He adds that the United States hoped to avoid a war in the Middle East, and that diplomatic means were preferable to potential alternatives. U.S. officials and foreign diplomats suggest that the heightened rhetoric is designed to get the attention of Iranian officials.
Argentina agrees to sell a "fuel fabrication facility" and a "uranium dioxide conversion plant" to Iran. Argentina rejects Iran's request for a facility to produce heavy water. Argentina cancels the deal under US pressure. Iran protests, saying that the equipment would have been covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Argentina provides Iran "hot cells."
Argentina considers supplying Iran with "turnkey" facilities for converting uranium concentrate to uranium dioxide and for fuel fabrication, the United States believes. Also, the United States believes the two countries are negotiating heavy water production equipment sales as well. The United States other countries supply the Argentine government with intelligence information that convinces it to halt the exports.
Argentina is selling hot cells to Iran. Iran may have received other nuclear-related assistance and material from Argentina. Argentina reportedly remains interested in helping Iran complete construction on the two reactors at Bushehr. [Note: The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists describes hot cells as "heavily shielded rooms with remotely operated arms used to chemically separate material irradiated in the research reactor, possibly including plutonium laden 'targets'."]
Argentina suspends contracts for nuclear projects in Iran.
Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister announces the suspension of an $18 million contract between Iran and Argentina's Investigaciones Aplicadas (INVAP), which would provide Iran with nuclear technologies.
Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella denies that the Argentine government cancelled the export of all nuclear materials to Iran at the request of the United States [Note: See 22 and 26 January 1992 for more on this topic.]
Argentine President Carlos Menem blocks the shipment of dual-use technology from Argentina's Investigaciones Aplicadas (INVAP) to Iran, despite the earlier arrival of Argentine technicians in Iran in connection with the deal. The deal, which has been valued at $18 million, involves nuclear reactor material, including tubing and machine tools. Another source indicates that the blocked shipment includes equipment for two contracts between INVAP and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran: $9.7 million worth of equipment for a uranium conversion and purification pilot plant and $14.9 million worth of equipment for a fuel fabrication pilot plant. INVAP also has a contract to conduct $5.6 million of support work for the operation of the Tehran Nuclear Research Center's research reactor with a 20% core.
Argentine President Carlos Menem cancels Investigaciones Aplicadas' (INVAP) proposed shipment of machine tools worth $18 million to the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran due to lack of adequate safeguards. [Note: See entry on the blocking of the deal on 7 February 1992. See 17 November 1992 for more on this topic.]
Arms control critics in the United States, such as Senator Jon Kyl, feel that Iran and other "rogue" states could develop nuclear weapons without testing them. Kyl said, "Although nuclear testing is essential to maintaining the sophisticated nuclear weapons in the US arsenal today, it is not required to develop relatively simple first-generation nuclear devices, like those sought by Iran and Iraq." He further said on 5 June 2000 in Washington that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) could n't stop the nuclear weapons program of any "rogue" state. Russia, unlike the United States, has developed the capability of increasing the production of nuclear weapons without violating the CTBT. Therefore, they will continue to oppose Senate ratification of the CTBT, which is useless at a time when China, North Korea, and Russia transfer nuclear weapons and missile technology to Iran, Libya, and Syria, critics added.
Arms Control Today reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin reaffirms Russia's commitment to complete the Bushehr nuclear power station. Officials from the US government also comment on the nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran as not being "well advised." The reactor at Bushehr has yet to be completed, with delays attributed to both Iranian and Russian sides, and is scheduled to be completed in 2003. Russia reaffirms that its activities in Iran are under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran is reported to have expressed further interest in a second reactor in Bushehr once work on the current one is complete.
Arms Control Today reports that, according to US intelligence assessments, despite being a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran is continuing its acquisition of nuclear-related technology. Russia's intelligence assessments, last time they were released, were in agreement with the US assessment. Russian officials, however, firmly refute that civilian aid supplied to Iran can help them develop military nuclear capability. In a recent testimony, Robert Einhorn, the assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, says that despite the promises from Russian officials, assistance to Iran from government-associated sources continues and has in fact accelerated in recent months. He adds that this assistance goes beyond the Bushehr plant and "much of this assistance involves technologies with direct application to the production of weapons-grade fissile material and could significantly shorten the time Iran would need to acquire weapons-usable fissile material." Russia, as the only supplier of nuclear technology, is critical to Iran's efforts to gains weapons of mass destruction. Russia is reportedly involved not only for financial gains but also to "advance important security interests." Iran's acquisition motives, on the other hand, stem from a need for self reliance and regional hegemony, and therefore are entrenched in the values of the Islamic Republic, and thus not easily changed. The US policy of isolation has succeeded in retarding Iran's speed of acquisition as well as making it costlier.
Arye Herzog, head of the Homa Missile Defense Program at the Israeli Defense Ministry, states that Israel's Arrow anti-ballistic missile system is fully capable of defending Israel from Iran's Shahab-3 Missile. He tells IDF radio, "We are fully capable of dealing with whatever the Iranians have today, which is the Shahab-3."
As inspections into Iran's nuclear activities continue, IAEA head Mohammad ElBaradei says, "I keep calling on Iran to be proactive as possible and to go out of its way to help us bring some of these issues to a closure."
As negotiations with the three European countries continue, an Iranian delegate to the Atomic Energy Agency, Sirius Nasseri, says his country's position depends on what the Europeans offer in way of incentives. "If there is a political agreement, it has to be give-and-take...but Iran will have a nuclear fuel production program for peaceful purposes." In response, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the Iranians must "demonstrate that they're prepared to live up to their obligations in a way that is verifiable."
As part of the "pragmatic policy of engagement," the United States secures promises from China over the sales of nuclear technology to Iran. The United States, fearing the civilian nuclear technology provided to Iran by China could be used to develop weapons of mass destruction, threatens to withhold US nuclear reactors and technology for China's civilian industry if China does not cease in its nuclear cooperation with Iran. According to a US official China has provided "very firm, clear, and explicit assurances" that it will not allow the transfer of nuclear technology to Iran. President Clinton sums up the US relationship, stating "China has lived up to its pledge not to assist un safeguarded nuclear facilities in third countries, and it is developing a system of export controls to prevent the transfer or sale of technology for weapons of mass destruction." [Note: See 21 October 1997.]
Asadollah Saburi, deputy director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, confirms that China has refused to deliver two 300MW reactors to Iran. The Bushehr nuclear power plant is scheduled to go into operation in 2005. The initial output of the plant will be only 20% of what was originally planned, in part because of the Chinese decision to withhold the reactors.
Asadollah Saburi, Deputy Head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says Iran has severed its ties with China regarding nuclear projects. Saburi states "The Chinese reached a conclusion to work on nuclear matters with other countries, not Iran. Our contract was cancelled partly for political reasons."
Asadollah Saburi, deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), and Yevgeniy Adamov, the Russian atomic energy minister, discuss options regarding cooperation in constructing the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Russia promises to build turbines needed for the nuclear power plant's generators if Ukraine fails to provide them. Adamov invites AEOI head Gholam Reza Aqazadeh to Russia for a meeting in May to discuss future cooperation concerning Russia's building of two more energy units for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The United States continues to denounce any agreements made between Russia and Iran concerning the transfer of nuclear technology. Moscow counters US apprehension by reminding the United States that the VVER-1000 reactor, which would be used in the construction of the Bushehr plant, cannot be used for the production of nuclear materials. Russia intends to continue its relationship with Iran concerning nuclear power despite US opposition.
A foreign assistance budget that would prohibit any future US aid to countries which agree to assist Iran in developing nuclear related capabilities was passed by a US Senate Appropriations subcommittee. On 8 June 1995, the US House of Representatives passed a similar amendment to the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561) stipulating an automatic cut-off of foreign assistance to any state that supplies Iran with nuclear reactor technology. The Clinton administration has said it would veto the bill. The foreign assistance budget also allocates $16.5 million to the FBI to "counter" nuclear smuggling in the former Soviet Union.
Asadollah Saburi, Iran's Deputy Head of the Atomic Energy Organization, says 26.4% of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is complete, and expects 38% to be complete by the end of the current Iranian year. Saburi blames periods of slow progress on ambiguities within the contract between Russia and Iran over each nation's respective duties regarding construction of the plant.
Asadollah Saburi, the deputy head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says 50% of the work on the first unit of the Bushehr nuclear power plant is complete. [Note: See 16 January and 27 June 2001 for differing recent estimates of completion percentages.] As for construction delays, he says "the Russian experts' level of management and planning did not equal their level of technical qualifications." In response to a question about Iran's plans for spent nuclear fuel from the Bushehr plant, he says "we intend to use new technology for recycling uranium and thus use the remains once again in the plant."
Asked about rumors of nuclear cooperation between Iran and China, the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Mr. Karrubi, says "those rumours are fabricated by Western arrogant powers and they are not true." [Note: China acknowledged cooperating with Iran in its peaceful nuclear program in late October or early November. See 4 November 1991.]
Asked by a reporter in Tehran why the schedule for completing the Bushehr nuclear power plant has changed, Mikhail Sarafanov, Russia's deputy minister for foreign economic relations and trade, says the "delays in the schedule of construction of the nuclear plant were not the Russian side's fault." [Note: The article does not say how long the schedule is pushed back.]
A group of International Atomic Energy Agency officials, led by IAEA Deputy Director General for Safeguards Bruno Pellaud, visits Iranian nuclear facilities in Tehran, Isfahan, and Karaj. In December 1993, IAEA spokesman David Kyd reports that the officials "found no evidence which was inconsistent with Iran's declaration that all its nuclear activities are peaceful." Both the IAEA visit to Iran in November 1993 and an earlier IAEA visit to Iran in 1992 were carried out under "a standing invitation from Iran to discuss its nuclear program." According to Kyd, the IAEA visit to Iranian nuclear facilities "was not an inspection per se but a familiarization visit" to see if anything had changed since the February 1992 IAEA visit to Iran. The visits were made partly in response to allegations in the West, including claims by members of Iranian opposition groups in exile and "pro-Israel researchers," that Iran has a secret nuclear weapons program. Like the previous IAEA visit in February 1992, it is not a full or special inspection mission. The team is not given full access to all activities nor to soil and particle samples at the sites.
Asked by a Russian reporter why Iran needs a nuclear power plant when it is a major exporter of gas and oil, Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, responds, "We are a developing country; we need to expand our energy base. You can't rely entirely on oil and gas alone." He says Iran is also building hydroelectric and thermal power stations, and hopes to get one-fifth of its energy from nuclear energy.
At a closed-door meeting, the Israeli Knesset's State Comptroller Committee discusses Iran's long-range missiles and nuclear capabilities. Israeli experts say that Iran may develop a nuclear weapons capability in less than 18 months. Prime Minister Benjamin Nethanyahu cautions Israel to be prepared for an Iranian threat if the United States fails to stop Iran from building nuclear weapons. Uzi Aram, Israeli advisor to the prime minister, is working closely with US Vice President Al Gore, to put an end to Russian supply to Iran of hardware and scientific assistance for weapons of mass destruction.
At a conference on nuclear technology in Tehran, Hassan Rowhani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator says that "the country will never permanently cease enriching uranium." Voicing his dissatisfaction with the pace of the talks, Mr. Rohani says "every time the talks get serious the Europeans say they have to talk to the other side of the Atlantic [the United States]". Should the case be referred to the Security Council, "there would be no more confidence."
At a conference sponsored by the Union of Scientists for Disarmament in Castiglioncello (Italy), Iranian representative to the Chemical Weapons Convention at the Hague Hassan Mashadi declares that Iran is "keeping its nuclear options open." Mashadi adds, "Iran does not believe it should renounce that [nuclear weapons] option if its survival is at stake." According to Mashadi, Iran fears an attack by Israel, which has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and believes that for the sake of security it has to have long-range missiles. "You cannot expect a nation with legitimate security concerns to sit idly by in the face of a threat. If you tell them not to go nuclear, then what option do you leave open for them?" Mashadi adds, "Iran is not a country to be ignored. If these pressures continue, there will be an explosion, and the whole region will be on fire." Independent Iranian analyst Shahram Chubin contradicts his colleague, saying that Israel is a "political problem, not a national security issue." However, Chubin says there are "clear signs" that Iran is keeping open a nuclear weapons option and claims that Iran has legitimate reasons to think it necessary to do this. He notes, however, that the possession of two or three weapons "will only generate concern." Mashadi qualifies his declarations, saying that his opinions were his own and not those of the Iranian government. However, according to former New York Times journalist Leon Siegel, Mashadi "was giving a clear message. He was obviously comfortable with what he was saying and authorized to say it."
At a George Washington University forum entitled "Preventing Super-Terrorism," leading Israeli nuclear physicist Yuval Neeman recommends that Israel "should abandon its present stance and explicitly go nuclear" if Tehran obtains a nuclear bomb. Asserting that an Iranian nuclear capability would place the world "on the brink of a new holocaust," Neeman argues that Israel would need a credible and effective second strike capability in order to deter the nuclear threat from Iran.
At a joint press conference with USPresident Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsinannounces that Russia will not sell a gas centrifuge to Iranand will eliminate all "military" aspects of Russia's nuclear deal with Iran. Yeltsin says the "military element" includes"the creation of nuclear weapons-grade fuel and a centrifuge and the construction of silos" [presumably for uranium storage]. The Russian-American Commission for Economic and Technological Cooperation (Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission) will review the military components of the nuclear deal, as well as other matters of Iranian-Russian military relations. Inparticular, the commission will review the protocol to the Iran-Russia nuclear agreement, which, among other things,deals with how to handle spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste from the reactors. [Note: For more information on the secret additional protocol, see 5, 11, 17, and 18 May and 2 June1995.] Iranian deputy foreign minister Mahmud Vaezi says:"Since this [Gore-Chernomyrdin] committee will deal with military issues, it is not likely to be at odds with our agreement with the Russians." Vaezi also says Russianofficials gave him "definite assurances" that the contract for the construction of the Bushehr plant will be fulfilled."Clinton has achieved no success," Vaezi says, in convincing Russia not to go ahead with "the transfer of nuclear technology to Iran." Russia's Atomic Energy Minister ViktorMikhailov refuses to rule out the sale of a centrifuge to Iranin the future, but says the agreement signed with Iran doe snot include a centrifuge. Reza Amrollahi, head of the AtomicEnergy Organization of Iran, says in a radio interview that Iran did not seek centrifuges and they are not part of the agreement with Russia. [Note: See 17 and 18 May and 2 June for apparently contrary reports.] Amrollahi says, "Anyone who knows about these things knows there can be no centrifuge in the nuclear power plant agreement....In our agreement, we made no mention of centrifuge, and have never sought this. I think this is nothing but childish hostility started by the UnitedStates." Amrollahi also denies that Iran seeks nuclear energy for military purposes; the International Atomic Energy Agencyagrees with this assessment. Iran has spent $10 to $12 billion on the Bushehr power plant, according to Amrollahi, and could produce electricity from it if it spends less than $800million more. "It is logical," Amrollahi says, "for our country to complete this plant as soon as possible so that we do not waste the investment and so that we can end the energy shortage in the country, giving us a reliable source of energy for at least 30 years, the lifespan of a power plant, and making the most of our investment." In a separate interview,Amrollahi denies that Iran bought 500k g of uranium--or any uranium--from Kazakstan.
At a meeting between Iranian Energy Minister Habibollah Bitaraf and Russian Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Alexander Dondukov in Moscow, the two nations vow to increase cooperation on nuclear power engineering, oil, and gas. Russian spokesperson Vadim Lazutin says, "Iran is interested in furthering cooperation with Russia primarily in the nuclear power engineering sphere as well as in oil and gas shipments."
At a meeting between Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and the president of the China National Nuclear Corporation, Jiang Xinxiong, Velayati expresses his hope that Iran and China will strengthen their cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Jian Xinxiong is in Iran holding business talks with Iran's atomic organization leaders over the bilateral cooperation in building a 300,000k W (300MW) nuclear power station in Iran. [Note: See 31 October 1992, 8 July 1993.]
At a meeting of ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in Indonesia, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati says the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty should not be extended indefinitely without conditions, but only if the treaty is completely implemented, presumably a reference to Israel's nonparticipation in the treaty. Velayati calls on NAM to "take necessary measures against those governments which allowed Tel Aviv to develop and keep nuclear weapons." He says the only way to achieve a nuclear-free world is by expanding nuclear-weapon-free zones.
At a meeting of NATO Defense Ministers to discuss strategies for countering a "growing nuclear threat from maverick nations and guerilla groups," US Defense Secretary Les Aspin submits proposals to NATO that include plans to improve intelligence networks in order to identify technologies or nuclear arms that may have been obtained or were being sought by nations such as Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and others.
At a meeting of the ASEAN security forum in Brunei, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher tells Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev that the United States sees no changes in Iran's policy that lessen concerns about its possible work on nuclear arms. Kozyrev responds that Russia understands the US concerns and that the issue should be reviewed further in talks between the United States and Russia. But he says Russia has no proof Iran is creating nuclear arms.
At a meeting of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran chaired by Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the decision is made to rebuild the Bushehr nuclear power plant, damaged by numerous Iraqi attacks.
At a meeting of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, US Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin decide that Russia's nuclear deal with Iran will be discussed only in one-on-one meetings between the two. Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov says "an atomic power station with two or four units will be constructed and there is going to be no wavering about this."
A high ranking official from the Israeli general staff claims the Iranian Defense Ministry is carrying out a secret program to obtain nuclear weapons not connected to the Bushehr facility. During the meeting with Russian members of the press, he added "there are mines where uranium is being extracted, and there are centrifuges belonging to the Defense Ministry."
At a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Javad Zarif, Iranian deputy foreign minister, calls for practical steps towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. He says nonproliferation cannot work while nuclear weapons exist.
At a meeting with leaders of the Group of Seven (G-7) Russian President Boris Yeltsin says the international community should be watchful of Iran's nuclear research activities. The leaders at the meeting agree to stop any assistance to Iran's civilian nuclear needs if Iran attempts to develop nuclear weapons.
At a meeting with officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, IRGC commander Yahya Rahim Safavi says, "Can we withstand American's threats and domineering attitude with a policy of dÃtente? Can we foil dangers coming from America through dialogue between civilizations? Will we be able to protect the Islamic Republic from international Zionism by signing conventions to ban proliferation of chemical and nuclear weapons?" [Note: According to Michael Eisenstadt, the IRGC is believed to control Iran's WMD and missile programs, giving Safavi's views on these matters much importance.]
At a meeting with Russian experts in Moscow, US analyst Robert Einhorn of the Center for Strategic and International Studies says the United States should lift its opposition to Russian cooperation on the Bushehr nuclear power plant. "Russia is too committed to complete the Bushehr project and has a strong economic and political stake in carrying the project to fruition," he says. "It's time to adopt a new approach. The United States should agree to a full range of nuclear cooperative activities (with Russia) despite...the Bushehr project, provided Iran is ready to accept certain critical restrictions on its own nuclear activities and to accept stronger means of (verification)." He says Russia should limit its cooperation to Bushehr, and commit to supplying the fuel and taking back the spent fuel. Russia should also persuade Iran to sign the Additional Protocol, he adds.
At a news conference, Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman to the Iranian opposition group NCRI, reveals the existence of a new Iranian nuclear complex northwest of Tehran. According to Mr. Jafarzadeh, the site known as the Kohladouz complexâis under more direct military control than other sites that were previously revealed by NCRI and confirmed by the IAEA. In addition, Mr. Jafarzadeh states that information on the site came from the group Mujahedeen Khalq and that the complex is hidden among warehouses and workshops for building tanks and armored personnel carriers.
A high-ranking British Foreign Office official informs Izvestiya that it believes there is a possibility that technological information pertaining to nuclear technology could be transferred to Iranian technicians who are being trained by Russian scientists. The exchange of information is part of an agreement signed between Tehran and Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy to provide building expertise for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Tehran, Britain asserts, has kept spent nuclear fuel instead of transferring it to Russia as stipulated in the agreement. Britain further believes Iran has procured nuclear technologies that do not have civil applications, specifically, the purchase of a uranium enrichment plant from China, which cannot be used in a civilian reactor.
At a press conference during the IAEA General Conference in Vienna, Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, announces that Iran and Russia have signed a 15-year bilateral nuclear accord on 24 August 1992. [Note: See 24 August 1992 entry.]
At a press conference following meetings with Russian officials in Moscow, John Bolton, US undersecretary of state, says he expressed US concerns over Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran. He says the two sides have differences over the issue and that is important the two sides come to an understanding. He says US President George Bush is very concerned about proliferation. Bolton says the United States will not compensate Russia if it were to give up construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant or halt conventional arms sales to Iran.
At a press conference in Moscow, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Hans Blix says that IAEA inspections did not detect any evidence of nuclear-military programs in Iran. Blix says that he does not view US opposition to the Russian-Iranian agreement as interference in the internal affairs of the two countries, and that "such contracts must be open to the public, since it is the matter of nuclear safety for many countries." According to Blix, new restrictions "on selling nuclear materials or technologies for their production" are complicating current discussions between Russia and the US on Russian sales of enriched uranium and the Russian-Iranian deal. The restrictions did not exist when Russia and Iran signed the agreement in early 1995. Under the Russian-Iranian agreement, the first VVER-1000 type [1000MW] reactor should be activated by the year 2000.
At a Teheran news conference, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani denies reports that Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon. President Rafsanjani declares that Iran "cannot afford to purchase [and] will never try to purchase" nuclear bombs.

At an inter-parliamentary conference in New York, the speaker of Iran's parliament Mahdi Karrubi, says "it is imperative that serious action be taken to achieve total elimination of nuclear weapons."
At the 35th general session of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, says the "peaceful use of atomic energy is the right of all nations, and provided the entire control and inspection measures and systems have been checked out, no country should be deprived of that right." He says Iran will complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant "through any means possible, even through purchasing and reordering the project's withheld spare parts." He says Iran "expects the IAEA to cooperate in all stages including that of implementation of the construction and activation of the said plant."
At the 44th General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, president of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, renews Iran's call for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. "After about three decades of international efforts," he says, "it is however quite unfortunate to see Israel still roaming around without showing any signs of tendency towards embracing Non-Proliferation Treaty and other international legally binding instruments in this regards."
At the annual meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, calls for Israel to put its nuclear facilities under full-scope IAEA safeguards.
At the annual meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, Iran reasserts its stance regarding the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Iran's delegation, which includes senior officials of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, affirms that its country's use of nuclear technology is for scientific, medical, industrial, and agricultural purposes only.
A high-ranking Pakistani official denies nuclear cooperation with Iran.
At the end of a two-day conference in Brussels, EU foreign ministers reaffirm that the European Union welcomes Iran's commitments per its agreement in Tehran on October 21 and "is now looking forward to its prompt and full implementation."
At the invitation of RezaAmrollahi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran,the International Atomic Energy Agency visits six locations in Iran in seven days, including Bushehr, the Isfahan NuclearTechnology Center, the Amirabad Nuclear Research Center inTehran, the Karaj Agricultural and Medical Research Center,Saghand, and Moallem Kalayeh. Three of the facilities have never been inspected before. IAEA Deputy Director JonJennekens says, "We visited without any restriction everything we had asked to see. All nuclear activities in Iran are solely for peaceful purposes." One team member, however, callsJennekens' report an "impudent and unfounded whitewash." It is alleged that the Iranians took the team to a decoy site, a vacation spot known as Moallem Kalayeh, rather than a town by the same name said to house uranium enrichment facilities. Inresponse to a charge that the IAEA had inspected a fake facility and not the real Moallem Kalayeh facility, David Kyd,spokesman for the IAEA, says, "None of our member states ever suggested that we were taken to a wrong location." An official with the IAEA says the calutron inspected did not have the direct capability to enrich uranium.
At the sixth Review Conference of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi says Iran is committed to the treaty and favors a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.
At the United Nations, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen says China has suspended its nuclear cooperation agreement with Iran because of the site's unsuitability. He rejects the US statement that the sale of two 300MW reactors to Iran had been cancelled, and says the deal has been "suspended for the time being," because of a disagreement between the two sides over the final site selection. But he says Russia is threatened with being "left alone in the international arena," if it proceeds with its Iranian nuclear contract. The Chinese chose a site near Darkhovin, the intended location for French reactors, which were also left unfinished after a construction project was undertaken during the 1970s. Iran considers the Darkhovin site unsuitable because of its close proximity to the border with Iraq. [Note: See 27 September 1995.]
A Japanese newspaper claims North Korea is in talks to export its Taepodong-2 long-range ballistic missile to Iran and to jointly develop nuclear warheads with Tehran. They would also send experts to Iran to provide them with assistance on missile technology. [Note: The Taepodong-2 has a range of over 6,000k m (3,700 miles)].
Atomic Energy Deputy Minister Yevgeniy Reshetnikov signs an extension to a January 1995 contract with Iran. The contract is amended to include the supply of Russian nuclear fuel to Iran for 10 years. The amendment adds $300 million to the $800 million Russian- Iranian nuclear power contract. The nuclear fuel will be provided by the Novobinsk nuclear plant and returned for reprocessing and storage at the RT-2 nuclear facility in Zhelenogorsk (formerly Krasnoyarsk-26). In response to allegations that Russia may secretly provide Iran with nuclear technologies, Russian Nuclear Power Minister Viktor Mikhailov explains that there is only one contract, signed between Russia and Iran for sale of one VVER-1000 [1000MW] reactor and the provision of its nuclear fuel supply. [Note: See 29 August 1995 entry for a similar statement by Mikhailov and Reza Amrollahi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, that only one contract exists.] Mikhailov adds that the contract includes "the eventual supply of up to four reactors for the Bushehr site." [Note: On 29 April 1995, Mikhailov says there is only one contract for the construction of the first reactor at Bushehr.] Mikhailov, however, is uncertain about a time frame for the signing of contracts for the additional units.
Atomstroiexport chief Viktor Kozlov states that Russian technicians began the assembly of the heavy equipment due to form part of the first reactor at Bushehr. He says "all the material envisaged in the contract [with Iran] has arrived by sea in the Iranian port [of Bushehr] on the Gulf." Mr. Kozlov, the chief of the state controlled firm that is charged with the implementation of the $800 million Russia-Iranian contract, says that 600 Russian technicians were currently in Bushehr and by the end of the year that their number would increase to about 2000. He states "they will be joined by their families and will live in a special village that has been set up for them near the site of the plant."
Atomstroiexport General Director Victor Kozlov tells Interfax that Russia will ship a turbine to the Bushehr nuclear power plant that is currently under construction. He says, "The turbine has a capacity of 1,000 megawatt and was assembled at the Leningrad Metal Works. It has been loaded on a ship en route to Iran and will be delivered to the construction site in four weeks."
Attempting to rally support for sanctions to be placed on Russia, Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the US House International Relations Committee, says, "It is clear that Russia has already provided Iran with critical know-how and technological support." According to sources Iran is supposedly within a year of reaching a point in its technological expertise that a cessation of Russian assistance will not significantly diminish Iran's ability to produce weapons of mass destruction.
Ayatollah Ahmad Janati, head of the Guardian Council of Iran and a top Iranian cleric, states that Iran should consider leaving the NPT after international pressures on its nuclear program.
Ayatollah Mohajerani, deputy president of Iran, says "because the enemy [Israel] has nuclear facilities, the Muslim states too should be equipped with the same capacity."
A Jerusalem Post editorial of an interview between CNN and Iranian President Mohammad Khatami [Note: See 7 January 1998] says that his statement about Iran's adherence to peaceful nuclear-use doctrine contradicts the fact that the Iranian government has spent $1.2 billion on the Shehab missile, which is capable of carrying a one-ton warhead 1,200 kilometers. The CIA, the Post says, purports that Iran is attempting to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.
Azerbaijani customs seize 22 tons of steel alloy on the Azerbaijani-Iranian border. [Note: See also 26 April 1998.]
Azerbaijani newspaper Azadliq reports that Iranians have transported loads of soil from Babak and Culfa districts in Azerbaijan. These regions are believed to be very rich in uranium. The newspaper reports that excavations took place at night.
Baroness Elizabeth Symons, Middle East Minster in the British Cabinet, denies any U.S. military intentions against Iran, adding that "if there were, no we would not support them."
Basij forces in Iran begin training for an imaginary invasion against Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant. Training also includes familiarization with radioactive residue leakage and similar scenarios.
Because Iran exports a sizeable amount of its energy product to neighboring countries, Iran states its need for atomic energy for energy needs within the country, so as not to resort to fossil fuel power plants.
Because of delays and quality control problems with Iranian subcontractors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, Iran converts many of the subcontracts with Iranian subcontractors to Russian contractors on a "turnkey" basis. This will also improve Russian control over and integration of the project. Iranian subcontractors tasked to build the reactor hall had completed only five months worth of work in 25 months.
Belarusian authorities accuse the media of "falsely interpreting the results of [Belarus President] Alyaksandr Lukashenka's visit to the Middle East." Ivan Antanovich, the Belarusian Foreign Minister, refutes allegations that Belarus is negotiating with Iran over cooperation in the area of nuclear technology.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, asks the world's major powers to come together to prevent Iran and Iraq from developing nuclear weapons, stating "They're not partners in the process and they're arming themselves feverishly and this is a problem for the international community," he says. Netanyahu asserts that his success in securing China's promise not to provide Iran with a nuclear reactor is indicative of the type of sentiment needed in the international community to "ensure Iran does not arm itself with non-conventional weapons."
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, says he is concerned about the proliferation of nuclear technology in western Asia, an area the Islamic Republic News Agency says alludes to Iran and Iraq. He further states his disapproval of the visit of Kamal Kharazi, communication advisor of the prime minister, to Pakistan, where it is assumed by the Israeli government that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Iran claims that it does not approve of Pakistan's and India's nuclear tests, deeming them "destabilizing and dangerous."
Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, asks Viktor Posuvalyuk, Russia's deputy foreign minister, to stop supplying arms to Iran, and to clarify Russia's position regarding its supplying of nuclear technology to Iran.
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Israeli defense minister, says in the next decade, Iran's nuclear program will reach a "point of no return," from which time "it would be impossible to stop it from attaining a bomb." [Note: See 2 and 13 September 2001 for further Israeli estimations on Iran's nuclear program.]
A Majlis [Iranian Parliament] session passes a bill that will provide for economic and trade cooperation between Russia and Iran. The bill stipulates that the two countries will cooperate in the field of nuclear technology.
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Israeli defense minister, says Iran could have nuclear weapons by 2005.
Boris Rosev, a Los Alamos National Laboratory technical staffer who recently spent more than one year in Russia studying its nuclear safeguards, says that President Yeltsin is using Russia's perceived technical expertise in the sphere of nuclear weapons to lure foreign investment. Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and other nations have set up trade offices in Moscow and are soliciting Russian research laboratories to work on their nuclear programs. Foreign nuclear projects are submitted to the government for approval but, according to Rosev, "it is easy to bribe anyone in the hierarchy to grant approval, or to change the name of the project." Rosev says that Russian scientists who work on foreign nuclear programs can see a ten-fold increase in wages, making it extremely difficult for them to turn down these projects. According to Rosev, the Russian government provides few subsidies to national research laboratories, and scientists are sometimes told that "the money is not there" for wages. According to Rosev, provisions for the direct payment of Russian scientists should be included in US programs for the safeguarding of nuclear materials at Russian research facilities and weapons sites.
Boris Yuriy Deryabin, Security Council deputy secretary, says Russia would like to further its cooperative relationship with Iran by building more nuclear power plants in Iran.
Both Gholam Reza Aqazadeh, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and Yevgeniy Adamov, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, proclaim that the finalization of the protocols pertaining to the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant are based in part on the emphasis "that fossil fuels are finite resources and that it is necessary to obtain nuclear energy." Both ministers reaffirm their commitment to the laws established by the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), promising each country "will only make peaceful use of nuclear energy." Aqazadeh repeats his condemnation of America's "double standards" noting its sale of weapons to Israel.
Brazilian Brigadier General Hugo Piva may be working in Iran, and US reports say Iran may receive nuclear weapons technology from Brazil.
Brazilian Infrastructure Minister Joao Santana says Brazil is not selling equipment to Iran from its Angra III nuclear power plant. "Six months ago Iran consulted with Brazil about buying Angra III, but I told them that there was no interest in such a sale," he says. "Six months later, Brazil continues to maintain its position and I don't even know if Iran is still interested."
Brazilian Infrastructure Minister Joao Santana says that Brazil is discussing the possible sale of equipment from the Angra-3 nuclear power plant for use in Iran's Bushehr reactor. The German government would have to approve any retransfer of the US equipment and technology Germany supplied for Angra-3, worth $150 million. [Note: See 7 July and 30 November 1991 for additional information on this topic.]
Brigadier General Yaaqov Amidror, the deputy head of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Intelligence Branch, says that Iran is the foremost threat in the region, where military buildup is increasing. Iran, according to this report, is trying to produce a nuclear weapon and will be able to produce unconventional weapons within five years.
Britain, France, and Germany send officials to Iran to explore "last-ditch mission" to resolve Iran's reservations with accepting the 31 October deadline. A Western diplomat in Tehran says to Reuters, "There were meetings here with senior government officials from Germany, Britain, and France to follow up on the letter and to find a constructive avenue to settle this crisis peacefully."
Britain, Germany, and France offers to assist Iran with technology, if Iran stops its disputed nuclear fuel enrichment program and agrees to sign the Additional Protocol to the NPT.
British customs seize 110 pounds of American-made maraging steel at the port of Barking that was destined for Iran. Iran used a front company to order the steel. According to one analyst, this incident shows Iran cannot yet make its own maraging steel at the Isfahan Alloy Steel Complex. [Note: See Third Quarter 1996.]
A meeting between the Israeli Cabinet and Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian president, takes place in Israel. In response to Israeli Foreign Minister David Levi's request to stop Ukrainian firms from participating in the construction of nuclear reactor in Iran, Leonid Kuchma says that he will stop the supply of turbines from Ukraine for the Iranian reactor if it becomes clear that its use could be for producing nuclear weapons.
British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo visits Israel, where he may have discussed joint Israeli-British military action against the Iranian nuclear plant.
British Foreign Office confirms Jack Straws intent to leave for Iran to join EU counterparts on talks over assisting Iran's "civilian nuclear project."
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd says the United Kingdom is tightening its export controls on dual-use technology and military-related equipment to Iran. Under the new British export controls, the Department of Trade and Industry will refuse approval of licenses for banned nuclear or military items listed on international rosters to Iran. The new British export restrictions exempt items considered necessary for keeping civil aircraft safe and also exempt radioactive materials used in medicine.
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reveals that MI6, Britain's foreign espionage service, has thwarted Iran's efforts to obtain British nuclear technology in the past year. Cook states that MI6 and the GCHQ communications monitoring agency have "tracked Iran's nuclear weapons programme, and have enabled [Britain] to disrupt Iranian attempts to procure British technology."
British Prime Minister Tony Blair states that Russia had pledged to suspend a planned shipment of nuclear fuel to Iran until the Iranians accept further international controls. Russia's top nuclear official denies this report and says that no such pledge had been given.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair underscores the importance of EU talks with Iran and of Iran's fulfillment of its obligations.
Bulat Nigmatulin, Russian deputy atomic energy minister, says Russia will not halt nuclear cooperation with Iran. He says such cooperation has "breathed life into our atomic machine-building programme. Iran pays for atomic power stations not with credits, but as and when the equipment is supplied. We supply equipment and get money for it."
Bulat Nigmatulin, Russia's deputy minister of nuclear energy, proclaims Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant will be completed as scheduled.
Bulgarian customs arrests a Kurd named Hanafi Yukazan with a container of highly enriched uranium. The arrest leads to a US investigation into smuggling of uranium and plutonium to Iran and Iraq from Ukraine.
Bushehr plant Manager Nasser Sharif-Loo states that Russia and Iran have began preliminary discussion to build a second nuclear plant in southern Bushehr.
Cable News Network reports that Iran hopes to obtain a second reactor from Russia, in addition to the Bushehr reactor, from Russia.
Chen Jian, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of China, says that China is not building an enrichment plant in Iran. Chen says, "[T]here is n't any nuclear cooperation between China and Iran that is not under the safeguard of the International Atomic Energy Agency." Chen also said that China has never exported any sensitive reprocessing, uranium enrichment, or heavy water production technology or equipment. Iran denies that China sold it uranium enrichment technology.
A ministry official of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry confirms that Atomic Energy Organization of Iran head Gholam Reza Aqazadeh will visit Moscow next May to discuss the $800 million contract to construct the Bushehr energy station. The Bushehr station, which he states will be completed before 2000, is planned to eventually consist of two power units with VVER-1000 reactors and two with VVER-440 water-moderated reactors. Dmitriy Frolov, in an article for Novyye Izvestiya, reports the importance of the sales to the failing Ministry of Atomic Energy, which could receive $1.5 billion from Iran for the purchase of uranium.
China acknowledges that it has cooperated with Iran's peaceful nuclear program. The Chinese statement comes after US Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon testifies before a Senate panel that US intelligence agencies believed China has sold nuclear equipment to Iran.
China agrees to sell a nuclear research reactor to Iran, according to the US Senate Committee on Government Affairs.
China agrees to supply Iran with two 300MW reactors. The US State Department strongly objects to the deal with the China. [Note: See 13 April 1993 entry for Iran's ratification of the agreement.] The Chinese-contracted plant will be of similar design to China's own Qinshan plant. Observers question China's ability to complete the Iranian project as key components in the Qinshan station, such as the pressure vessel, instrumentation and control, and primary pumps, were imported from international dealers. China it expects to be able to supply the components prior to the Iranian reactor's projected start up date in 2002.
China and Iran sign a military and scientific cooperation pact.
China and Iran sign an agreement regarding the supply of two 300MW reactors, according to Chinese Ambassador to Iran Hua Liming in an interview years later. The deal had previously been dropped because China was concerned about Iran's ability to finance the project, but China decides to go ahead with the arrangement. Other sources suggest it is questionable whether the transaction will actually take place, because of disagreements over the site where the reactors will be constructed and the handling of spent fuel, as well as financial and technical difficulties.
China confirms its stance that it will not provide Iran with nuclear technology. Shen Guofang, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, says "China has never transferred nuclear weapons and technology to any country including Iran." [Note: See 17 October 1997.] Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmud Mohammadi criticizes the United States for convincing China not to cooperate with Iran in the nuclear realm. "America's effort to pressure China into stopping peaceful nuclear cooperation with Iran is interference in other countries' internal affairs," he says. "The United States, motivated by political intentions and self-interest, has embarked on false propaganda against such cooperation." The Chinese foreign ministry says China has never "transferred nuclear weapons or technology to any country including Iran." He says, "Iran is not planning to purchase missiles from China." Cooperation between the two nations, Mohammadi states, is of a peaceful nature and is closely scrutinized by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He says, "Iran is not planning to purchase missiles from China." China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said that China had stalled cooperation with Iran due to "some disputes over the contract." [Note: See 25 October 1997.]
China confirms that it signed contracts to sell an electromagnetic separator [calutron] and a mini-reactor to Iran. Both Iran and China claim the reactor and calutron are to be used for peaceful purposes.
China denies that Chinese companies have sold the chemical anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (AHF) to the Isfahan Nuclear Research Center in Iran. Zhu Bangzao, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, says "China is a signatory of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It does not advocate, encourage or engage in nuclear weapons proliferation, nor does it help other countries develop nuclear weapons."
China gives Iran public support in its standoff with the IAEA, stating it opposed US efforts to have the matter referred to the UN Security Council.
China plans to supply Iran with nuclear reactors, scientific and technical training, expertise and components for missile production, and materials relevant to chemical weapons production. According to Western intelligence sources, China already supplies Iran with its "strongest and biggest nuclear backing."
China pledges to the United States not to assist with any nuclear facility that is not safeguarded.
China provides Iran with an HT-6B Tokamak fusion reactor that is installed at the Plasma Physics Research Center of Azad University. The center is believed to be run by M. Qorannevis.
A new export law decreed by the Italian Foreign Trade Ministry comes into effect, requiring special authorization from the Trade Ministry for all dual-use equipment exports. However, even prior to this law, special authorization would have been needed for export of steam condensers. In the past, uncertainties about the possible utility of dual-use equipment allowed strategic items to be exported from Italy to "high-risk" countries such as Libya, Iran, and Iraq. [Note: See 11 and 13 November 1993 for Italian seizure of steam generators bound for Iran.]
China releases details of its nuclear cooperation with Iran. According to a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, China and Iran signed deals for an electromagnetic separator for isotope production in 1989 and for a small reactor in 1991. "These facilities are used for nuclear medical diagnosis and nuclear physics research, isotope production, education, and personnel training," the statement says. "Guided by the internationally observed regulations, China had requested the International Atomic Energy Agency to enforce safeguards before these facilities were shipped." A US State Department spokesman says, "We are concerned that any dual-use equipment sold to Iran for commercial purposes could be diverted to other applications."
China sells Iran a 27k W research reactor. [Note: Construction of the reactor begins at Isfahan in September 1991. See entry. Also see March 1994 and 7 September 1995 entries on this reactor. This reactor should not be confused with a 27MW reactor also proposed for sale by China for installation at Isfahan. See 21 January 1990, 14 March 1990, June 1990, November 1991, and 1 June 1995 for entries on the 27MW reactor.]
China sells Iran a cyclotron, which will be eventually installed in 1992 at Karaj.
China sells Iran a small nuclear reactor apparently for training and research and installs uranium enrichment equipment at Darkhovin in Ahvaz.
China supplies Iran with a zirconium production facility for its civil nuclear program, according to the CIA. Iran will use the facility to produce cladding for reactor fuel, the CIA reports. Under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards guidelines, Iran is not required to place the zirconium plant or its products under international safeguards. Apparently, China is standing by its pledge from the October 1997 US-China summit by not engaging in any new nuclear cooperation with Iran. It is, however, completing two ongoing nuclear projects. Chinese President Jiang Zemin fulfilled his commitment to the United States by implementing regulations that cover the sale of dual-use nuclear equipment. The regulations took effect in June [1998?]. Entities within China, however, continue to provide missile-related items and assistance to several countries.
China suspends the sale by The China Nuclear Energy Industry to Iran of hundreds of tons of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, which can be used to enrich uranium. The chemical was intended for the Isfahan Nuclear Research Center. The amount would have been enough to last a decade in an "ambitious nuclear program." The suspension of the sale comes three years after the United States first discovered the sale and nearly two years after China pledged not to sell such products to Iran.
China's ambassador to Iran, Shi Ji Wang, expresses interest in developing relations with Iran and in helping build a nuclear power plant in central Iran, according to the official Iranian news agency IRNA. IRNA reports China is "fully determined" to continue construction of the 1,300MW power plant near Arak in central Iran.
China's Nuclear Industry Organization signs a contract to supply the Atomic Energy Organization with a "micro-nuclear" research reactor to be built at Isfahan. The size of the reactor was not disclosed, but one source implies it is approximately 30MW. [Note: This description of 30MW reactor may refer to the 27MW reactor proposed for installation at Isfahan. The 27MW reactor proposed for installation at Isfahan by China but never realized should not be confused with a 27kWt Chinese-supplied reactor at Isfahan that went critical March 1994. For entries on the 27kWt reactor, see 1991, September 1991, March 1994, and 7 September 1995. For entries on the 27MW reactor, see 21 January 1990, 14 March 1990, November 1991, and 1 June 1995.]
China's president, prime minister and foreign minister assure Israel's Foreign Minister David Levi that China has stopped discussing nuclear matters with Iran. [Note: The article does not give any specific details on what the Chinese leaders said.]
Chinese ambassador to Iran, Huali Ming, says that China and Iran are negotiating the financial terms for the sale of two 300MW nuclear reactors to Iran. The total cost of the project is estimated at $800 million, but according to Chinese sources, Iran's economic difficulties are preventing it from covering the costs.
Chinese experts are allegedly assisting the Iranians with their laser enrichment research at Moallem Kalayeh, at the city of Qazvin.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen rejects US concerns over the sale of a nuclear reactor to Iran, noting that Iran has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and accepts International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
Chinese official Xuehong Liu tells the journal Nucleonics Week that China "could not supply" Iran with a nuclear research reactor for "technical reasons." [Note: See March 1992 entry for entry on US pressure. The research reactor probably is a 20MW reactor. See 1 October and 17 November 1992 entries.]
Chinese officials provide "authoritative, written communications" that China will not engage in new nuclear cooperation with Iran. China will complete two current projects: a zero-power research reactor that uses heavy water and natural uranium, scheduled to be completed by the end of 1997; and the production of zirconium tubes, designed to hold fuel pellets in the core of a nuclear reactor. China has also agreed not to provide equipment to construct a heavy water, low-enriched uranium nuclear reactor to Iran, and to halt its plans to build a uranium hexafluoride (UF6) conversion plant in Iran. [Note: See 21 and 25 October 1997.]
Chinese Premier Li Peng meets with Iran's vice-president, Hassan Habbibi
Chinese President Yang Shangkun visits the Chinese-built nuclear research center at Isfahan in Iran. He also visits the Darkhovin facility in Ahvaz. He promises technical assistance to Iran to complete the Darkhovin and Bushehr reactors.
Chinese specialists are working at the Karaj complex, where China has installed a uranium-enrichment calutron system that some nuclear experts say will enable Iran to produce weapons-grade uranium. Some sources say the Chinese system resembles one the Iraqis used in their attempt to build a nuclear bomb. A top US official says that in addition to supplying uranium-processing facilities, the Chinese have also assisted Iran in developing uranium mining, fuel fabrication, and zirconium tube production, and may provide uranium metal and uranium hexafluoride manufacturing plants in the near future. China's contribution to Iran's nuclear development is thought to be confined to the transfer of technological information, and has not included actual weapons-related assistance. Chinese facilities in Iran are subject to International Atomic Energy Agency inspection, and thus far China's assistance seems to be in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Chinese technicians are seen at the Darkhovin site near Ahvaz installing uranium-enrichment equipment.
CIA Director George Tenet testifies before a Senate hearing that Iran may be able to make enough fissile material for a bomb by 2010 or much sooner if Iran were to get fissile material elsewhere.
CIA Director James Woolsey claims Iran would need eight to ten years to build a bomb.
CIA Director James Woolsey says "Iran is also looking to purchase fully fabricated nuclear weapons in order to accelerate sharply its timetable."
CIA Director James Woolsey says that the United States is concerned about Iran's nuclear potential, even though Iran is still eight to ten years away from being able to produce its own nuclear weapon. Woolsey said that Iran could become a nuclear power sooner if it acquired assistance from abroad.
CIA Director James Woolsey tells the Senate intelligence committee that Iran is most likely to continue developing nuclear weapons through indigenous resources; in which case it might have a weapon by 2000. He also says "Iraq and Iran...have the basic technology to eventually develop [nuclear] weapons."
A North Korean delegation composed of 29 experts in military technology returns from a "long visit" to Iran, during which they signed an agreement on military and nuclear cooperation, according to the Arab weekly Al-Watan Al-Arabi. The delegation was led by North Korean Air Force commander Cho Myong Nok. Diplomatic sources believe that the North Koreans visited military and nuclear facilities in Iran.
CIA Director Robert Gates testifies before Congress that Iran is "building up its special weapons capability as part of a massive...effort to develop its military and defense capability."
CIA Director Robert Gates testifies that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons and could procure one by 2000 if the West does not intervene.
CIA spokesperson Dave Christian says that according to the latest estimates, Iran could develop a nuclear bomb within six to eight years. Christian states that the Iranian nuclear weapons program is in its early stages and still heavily relies upon foreign technology and expertise.
CIS armed forces command general, Sergei Zelentsov, denies reports that a Kazakh scientist sold tactical nuclear weapons Iran. Zelentsov says, "I can guarantee that no scientist had access to these weapons." He says, "No unauthorized person can gain access to nuclear weapons, and no such person could gain access in the future."
Citing classified SAVAK documents contained in a recently published book, the author [Khamene'i's representative at the Kayhan Institute] bemoans the changed attitudes of Israel and the United States vis-Ã-vis Iranian nuclear activities. The documents evidently indicate a complete lack of opposition during the time of the Shah, even going as far as to suggest an Iranian army equipped with nuclear weapons.
CNN confirms reports and shows satellite pictures of two additional nuclear facilities in Iran: Natanz, a possible uranium enrichment facility located 100 miles south of Tehran; and Arak, a possible heavy water production facility that is located about 150 miles south of Tehran.
Colin Powell and Igor Ivanov are meeting in Moscow to discuss a variety of issues, including the war in Iraq, terrorism, and the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation.
Commenting on a recent report by the Sunday Telegraph that the British confiscated a cargo bound for Iran that could have been used for the construction of missile and atomic installations, Iran says that these are instances of the efforts made by its adversaries to harm Iran's reputation in the international community.
Construction begins at Isfahan on a 27k W research reactor sold by China to Iran. [Note: The reactor goes critical on March 1994. See entry. This reactor should not be confused with a 27MW reactor also proposed for sale by China for installation at Isfahan.

Construction on the Bushehr nuclear power plant is expected to be finished by February 2003, says Khalil Musavi, spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Construction is proceeding according to a plan signed in 1998, which called for finishing the project in 52 months.
Cuba and Iran sign an agreement to exchange information on nuclear technology. Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, the head of Cuba's nuclear energy program, finalizes the agreement during a visit to Iran.
Cypriot government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides says an expected shipment of civilian nuclear reactor equipment en route to Iran has not yet arrived. The interdiction is part of a bilateral effort by the United States and Cyprus to stop the flow of technologies and equipment that could aid Iran's nuclear program. Due to lax port regulations, the Cypriot ports of Larnaca and Limassol have become important transit points for shipments of unconventional weapons to Iran and Syria.
Cypriot officials are notified of the shipment of civilian nuclear reactor equipment heading towards Iran. US and Cypriot officials are preparing to intercept a shipment of equipment for a civilian reactor in Iran, expected to be shipped via Cyprus.

Czech company Skoka Plzen says it would like to do business with Iran, but will not sell weapons or nuclear technology.
Dany Shoham, an Israeli expert on weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, says Iran is only a few years away from getting a nuclear bomb. The only thing lacking is fissile material, says Shoham, a senior researcher at Bar-Ilan University's Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies. Iran is working hard to get fissile material, and with it Iran could have a bomb within a year.
A nuclear official announces that Russia is likely to sign a deal on nuclear fuel shipments to Iran this month. He says the first containers of fuel should be available within two months after the deal is concluded.
David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, says the agency has no evidence to support a report in The Times of London that Iran is trying to get nuclear material and equipment from South Africa.
David Kyd, the spokesperson of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reports the Russian ministry for nuclear power (Minatom) is conducting negotiations with Iran over the delivery of a 40MW nuclear reactor to Iran. Kyd refutes allegations made by Israeli intelligence services that Iran is trying to procure heavy water from Russia.
Decrying an "eerie similarity to the events preceding the Iraq war," former Iraq Survey Group leader David Kay urges cautious appraisal of next steps given the escalating rhetoric emanating from Washington regarding Iran's nuclear capability and intentions. He reminds readers that Iran is fully cooperating with the international inspection regime; despite admitting to concealing 18 years of nuclear activities, Iran claims ambitions to nuclear power only, and the IAEA has found no evidence of a nuclear weapons program. In particular, Kay advocates a set of measures tying Iran's nuclear activities to peaceful uses so that any departure is easily detectable; warns against "evidence" provided by regime dissidents with their own agenda; acknowledges the helpfulness of IAEA inspections; urges caution of overheated official rhetoric unsupported by evidence, which serves only to undermine constructive efforts; advocates serious analysis of the evidence available - not to rush or "cook" a National Intelligence Estimate on Iranian nuclear activities.
Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs Strategic Policy reports that four senior officials of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Information, including Minister Ali Fallahian, defect from Iran. [Note: Fallahian ran against President Khatami for the presidency of Iran in 2001 and as of 9 August 2002 was still in Iran. See 20 April 1995.]
Defense News reports that the CIA "believes that Iran could have nuclear weapons within eight to 10 years, even without critical assistance form abroad."
Defusing rumors of an attack on an Iranian nuclear power plant, Ali Agha Mohammadi, Supreme National Security Council spokesman, attributes an explosion in southern Iran to dam-building operations. A previous explanation delivered on state television suggested the possibility of a fuel tank dropping from an Iranian airplane.
A nuclear scientist from Pakistan denies there is any cooperation between Islamabad, Tehran, and Baghdad regarding nuclear weapons technology.
Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Valery Lebedev says that spent fuel from an Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant would be returned to Russia, countering worries that Iran could use the fuel to develop nuclear weapons. The statement was in response to claims from Greenpeace International that the waste would remain in Iran. According to Lebedev, "Russia will definitely observe the principles of the International Atomic Energy Agency under which spent fuel will return to the country supplying the fuel."
Deputy chairman of the Czech Republic's Chamber of Deputies Jiri Payne urges Industry Minister Miroslav Gregr not to support the possible delivery of Czech cooling facilities for an Iranian nuclear plant built with Russian assistance, as it could augment Iran's nuclear capacity. According to Payne, "This has unquestionable security impact on the whole region...."
Deputy Department Head of the Azerbaijani Ministry of National Security Tofig Babayev states that four people have been arrested for attempting to sell a container of a cesium isotope for $1.4 million. If convicted,the suspects face imprisonment for up to five years. TheAzerbaijani television station ANS reports that the material may have been taken from an industrial plant in Sumgait, about39k m north of Baku. Babayev says that the Ministry had received reports that a group of Azerbaijanis were attempting to sell uranium obtained from a military unit stationed in Azerbaijan. One of the suspects, who was the head of a workshop in the Sumgait plant and allegedly stole four containers of radioactive material, is suffering from prolonged radiation exposure. The Ministry of NationalSecurity is also searching for 14 other types of radioactive material stolen from various Azerbaijani chemical enterprises.Babayev states that the collapse of systems of proper control over radioactive substances has made such thefts commonplace in Azerbaijan. The head of the Ministry's press service states that the most likely potential buyer of the cesium would be a country interested in developing nuclear projects. The head of the press service says that two recent attempts by Iran to import missile- and nuclear-related goods supports the hypothesis that Iran is behind the theft of the radioactive material. [Note: See 14 Nov 1992 for other possible illegal exports from Azerbaijan to Iran. See 7 April and 5 June 1998for other possible attempts to smuggle nuclear-related material into Iran in general.]
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Ambassador Sergey Kislak says Iran has been gathering components for its nuclear program for 18 years. In a gesture to demonstrate its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, Tehran delivered a "detailed report on the goals of its program...[and] the IAEA Board of Governors Resolution of November 2004 does not call for the presentation of another report at the next session." Minister Kislak says the current Iranian program is more transparent but additional work is still required. Minister Kislak emphasized: "We are...against Iran acquiring nuclear weapons...we will do everything possible so that the program for the development of peaceful nuclear energy in Iran develops cooperatively."
Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Pavel Rychetsky, announces that the Czech government has blocked a $27.5 million contract for a private Czech company to sell cooling equipment for the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Der Spiegel reports that Iran's government is "making intensive efforts to acquire sensitive high technology for military purposes." It further asserts that German companies must use caution in their negotiations with Iran, warning that Iran is trying to procure "nuclear and carrier technology as well as the production of biological and chemical weapons."
Despite having criticized the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) text, Mohammad Jafar Zafid, deputy Iranian foreign minister and the head of the Iranian delegation to the CTBT talks, announces that Iran is going to sign the treaty. He emphasizes that Iran agrees with this decision because of its strong desire for the banning of nuclear weapons tests. He restates his disappointment at the lack of balance in the document and says that Iran will continue to seek total disarmament of nuclear weapons.
Despite increasing frequency of US condemnation of Russia's participation in the construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant continues, Yevgeniy Adamov, head of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, says Russia will continue to work on the plant regardless of US discontent over the issue.
Despite recent pressure asserted by the United States on Russia to halt the transfer of nuclear materials to Iran, China says it still plans to discuss delivery of a two-unit nuclear reactor to Iran. Chinese officials say they see no reason not to sell Iran or any other signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty nuclear energy equipment and technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency, China asserts, has not provided evidence to sway China from its obligations.
Despite rumors that Iran will be capable of producing a nuclear weapons in as little as three years, David Iriy, head of the Israeli delegation at multilateral arms control talks, says Iran will need at least five years to produce a nuclear weapon. But Iriy does believe Iran will be capable of producing weapons, stating "The Russians and Chinese are selling civilian nuclear reactors which will allow Iran to become a military nuclear power, all the more since North Korea is supplying Scuds as well as the technology to produce the missiles."
A Pakistani foreign office spokesman denies that Pakistan secretly cooperated with Iran in the nuclear field. "We had been cooperating with Iran just like with any other country under the aegis of International Atomic [Energy] Agency for the peaceful uses of nuclear technology," the spokesman says.
Despite tough new export controls, Germany approves about 80% of applications for licenses--approximately 200 licenses--to export to Iran dual-use technology included on the German "C list" of controlled items.

Deutsche Presse-Agentur reports Iran will not sign an indefinite extension to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) unless the five nuclear powers agree to reduce and eventually eliminate its nuclear arsenals. The treaty ends in a year, and Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, demands the nuclear states end production of weapons-grade nuclear material, and make accommodations to allow the transfer of nuclear energy technology to other states in need of other forms of energy production.
Dialogue is established between the United States and Iran even though tensions between the two countries run high over the question of Iran's nuclear program.
Die Welt reports Pakistani nuclear scientists are continuing their working relationship with Iranian nuclear scientists. The report further asserts that German intelligence believes Iran is working to develop sensitive technologies designed to enrich uranium to produce nuclear weapons, which they believe Iran will be capable of producing in three years.
Diplomatic sources in Moscow mention to Interfax that Iran has yet to approve the long-term program for economic cooperation until the year 2012, which was proposed by Russia. They state, "Iran has asked Russia to put off a meeting of the intergovernmental commission for trade and economic cooperation, which was earlier set for September, and was to initial the draft program... it needs to study the draft more thoroughly... hopefully, the Russian-Iranian intergovernmental commission for trade and economic cooperation will convene in Tehran and come to terms on the program before the end of 2002." The above mentioned program envisions cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, in building several nuclear power plants in Iran, and in the energy sector."
Diplomatic sources reveal that IAEA inspectors are pushing to return to the Parchin military complex to retrieve further samples. They have been granted only limited access to the site thus far.
Diplomats at a meeting of the IAEA say Iran is using reinforced materials and deep underground facilities to store and protect nuclear materials. Tehran was faulted for starting work on the tunnel, continuing construction at Isfahan, and "ignoring [a] request to scrap" plans for a heavy water reactor. Tehran admits the facility is under construction, but said it was to "increase capacity, safety and security of nuclear material."
Diplomats citing U.S. intelligence and speaking on condition of anonymity, say Iran is affecting quality checks on centrifuge parts despite pledging a moratorium on such activities.
Diplomats from the United States and Iran have informally discussed some form of "nuclear rapprochement." However, the United States expresses concerns that Iran may purchase stockpiled plutonium from North Korea.
Diplomats raise concerns over Iran's lack of information supplied regarding traces of highly enriched uranium and warn that it may lead to a declaration of a violation of the NPT if not cleared up by the 20 November IAEA Board of Governors meeting. Pakistan is suspected of being the most likely origin of questionable centrifuges by the diplomats.
Diplomats say that the United States is lobbying the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency for a declaration that would declare Iran in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
A Pakistani investigation of the Khan networks dealings with Iran reveal that Khan and his laboratory associates met more than a dozen times over several years, assisting the Iranians in establishing a worldwide procurement network and selling codes, materials, components, and plans to the Tehran government. The Pakistani investigators claim that Iran's centrifuge drawings are very similar to the first generation Pakistan-1 centrifuge. The IAEA has revealed that centrifuges at the Doshan Tapeh base in Tehran closely resemble the more advanced Pakistan-2 centrifuges.
Director of the Russian Federal Agency for Nuclear Power (Rosatom), Aleksandr Rumyantsev, provides Iran with scientific documents proving it would be "inexpedient, and even ruinous for the country to develop its own nuclear-fuel cycle."
Dr. Gerald Steinberg, Director of Research in Arms Control at the BESA Center for Strategic Studies, Bar-Ilan University, writes that the cancellation of a centrifuge deal will greatly impede Iran's ability to manufacture nuclear weapons. Steinberg asserts Iran will have difficulty is securing an alternate source for gas centrifuge technology, and this reversal is an "important victory" for the US administration. According to Steinberg, though this represents a major setback for Iran it is unlikely Iran will halt its nuclear program.
Dr. Husayn al-Shahrestani, an Iraqi atomic scientist who defected from Iraq in 1991 and now teaches nuclear sciences at the University of Tehran, says the Iranian nuclear program is not as developed as the Iraqi program because they lack the human and technical resources. He does not believe that the Iranians are seriously seeking a nuclear weapon.
Dr. Mohamed El Baradei states that he will be heading to Iran later this month with a team of IAEA experts to discuss Iran's nuclear programs and to urge the Iranians to accept the additional inspection protocol. Dr. El Baradei says "I would like to discuss with Iranian officials the possibility of Iran joining the Additional Protocol....That I think would clearly create additional assurance with regard to the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme."
Dr. Muhammad al-Baradi, the new IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) Director-General, in an interview with al-Majallah of London says Iran's nuclear capabilities have been closely monitored by the IAEA. Whether Iran or any nation will be capable of producing nuclear weapons in the future does not fall under the purview of the Agency, "In fact, this is not our responsibility, as our current responsibility lies in carrying out inspection operations and presenting a detailed report to IAEA member states."
Due to the IAEA's annual rotation of its board members, Iran's representation is replaced by Pakistan. Iran can still be present to voice concerns as an observer.
A press release from the Iranian embassy in Pakistan "categorically" rejects allegations printed in the Pakistani press that Iran offered to buy nuclear technology from Pakistan. According to the Iranian press release, unnamed Pakistani officials verified "the falsehood of such claims." In December 1992, Iran allegedly offered Pakistan $3.5 billion to share "nuclear know-how." According to reports in the Pakistani press, during Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's visit to Tehran, Iranian leaders reiterated the offer. Pakistan once again rejected the proposal, saying that "whatever little capability [Pakistan] has, that it was for peaceful purposes and could not be transferred to any third country." The US Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel confirmed that Pakistan rejected the proposal. [Note: See December 1992].
During a meeting at the International Atomic Energy Agency General Conference in Vienna, Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov and Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Chairman RezaAmrollahi discuss four amendments to the Russian-Iraniannuclear contract concerning financial compensation. Accordingto Russian officials, the financial agreement between Minatomand AEOI involves some barter trade, with the remainder to be paid by Iran in hard currency. A Russian official noted, "Iranwants to have the counter trade share as large as possible, and we want it to be as small as possible." Also at the conference, Mikhailov meets with US Department of Energy (DOE)Secretary Hazel O'Leary. Mikhailov assures O'Leary that"unconfirmed reports" on Russian assistance to Iran in building underground nuclear installations are unsubstantiated. Mikhailov also rejects the suggestion that Iran could make use of expertise provided by the Russiansduring training to develop nuclear weapons. The security measures designed to block information leaks from Minatom"impress" DOE officials, but do not change the US opposition to Russia's nuclear agreement with Iran. One US official says:"The meeting made clear that we are not going to changeMikhailov's mind on Iran." The AEOI declares Iran's readiness to take additional measures to assure that the Iranian nuclear program is only used for peaceful purposes in exchange for"greater international cooperation" and the end of the US"uncompromising campaign" to restrict any international nuclear technologies or scientific exchange with Iran. TheUnited States tried to convince Russia to include the obligatory use of "enhanced safeguards" in its nuclear contract with Iran. According to a Russian diplomat, if Irandecides to abandon the production of enriched uranium or plutonium separation, "that would have to be a step Iran alone would have to take."
During a meeting in Moscow between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Iranian parliament, Yeltsin announces that Russia has "a good positive cooperation with Iran, which shows a tendency to increase." Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk and his Iranian counterpart Mahmud Vaezi sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on export controls, emphasizing their commitment to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery.
During a meeting with acting president Vladimir Putin, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeniy Adamov denies allegations of supplying Iran and India with dual-use high technologies, including nuclear technologies. However, Adamov states that Minatom intends to continue building nuclear reactors in Iran and India, in spite of pending US sanctions against a number of Russian research centers and academic institutions. The profit from building the nuclear power plant in Bushehr will be $800 million, and the other three Iranian projects are worth $2.5 billion.
During a meeting with the US Under Secretary of State John Bolton, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov once again emphasizes that there was no basis for US concern about Russian-Iranian cooperation. During an interview following the meeting, Mr. Mamedov states, "Russian-Iranian cooperation on nuclear technology is totally peaceful, it is within the framework of international laws and regulations and it is also under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Thus, there is no basis for US official's concern about this issue....Despite this, the Americans always insist upon raising this issue at their consultation with us. This is despite the fact that Moscow has also expressed its concerns about Washington's nuclear cooperation with several countries that have their own nuclear arsenals....[I]n our talks with the American delegation, we said that Russia is an independent country and that our cooperation with Iran and other countries is aimed at furthering our own national interests."
During a Moscow visit, US Secretary of Defense William Perry says the United States might be willing to compromise with Russia on the reactor deal with Iran. He suggests that if the deal must go through, several steps there could be taken to reduce proliferation risks, such as strict control over the type of fuel to be generated. Perry admits that the imposition of constraints on the reactor sale is "a very poor second choice," and states that the United States will continue to push Russia to abandon the deal. However, Perry says that aid to Russia, especially aid for defense conversion, should not be cut off regardless of the outcome of the Russian-Iranian reactor deal. At a meeting between Perry and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, Russia rejects the US request that it cancel its contract to supply Iran with nuclear technology and equipment. US officials reveal that the United States has promised Russia "tens of millions of dollars" and a leading membership in the Korean Peninsula Development Organization if it suspends its nuclear agreement with Iran.
During a news conference, President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani says that even if North Korea has developed nuclear weapons, Iran does not want them. Rafsanjani was responding to the question of whether Iran is attempting to buy nuclear weapons from North Korea. Rafsanjani adds that Iran is not trying to obtain nuclear weapons.
During a program featuring the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran, a Russian television correspondent says that the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Reza Amrollahi, "does not hide the fact that his country has the scientific potential for creation of its own nuclear weaponry." [Note: Amrollahi later denies this accusation. See 15 April 1997.] Alexsandr Steblyanko, the chief of construction at Bushehr, says "as at any nuclear station, the spent raw material the spent products of the nuclear stationâmay no doubt be used as raw material for future military uses perhaps, but it all depends on politics." According to the correspondent, the Bushehr plant will provide 10% of Iran's electricity needs, and is "primarily Iran's testing ground for studying nuclear technology." Approximately 100 Russian technicians are working at Bushehr, earning $700 per month. Iran pays Russia about $7000 for each expert.
During a stopover at the Beijing airport, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with the Deputy Prime Minister of China. Netanyahu says he received assurances that China would not help Iran to build a nuclear reactor. A Chinese official declines to respond directly to questions whether Vice Premier Li Lanqing had given such assurance.
During a visit to Iran, Hans Blix, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says that Iran's nuclear programs are for peaceful purposes, and that Iran has always allowed the inspection of its nuclear facilities with little advanced notice. The IAEA detected no plutonium during recent inspections of Iran's nuclear research centers. Iranian President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani tells Blix, "Iranian nuclear programs are crystal clear and transparent and for humanitarian purposes. We always welcome sharing experience with respective international agencies." Blix says that all nations have "the natural right" to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
During a visit to Oman, Rear Admiral Ali Akbar Ahmadian, Commander of the Iranian Navy, proclaims Iran "has no nuclear weapons and does not want to have any." He further states that Iran's facilities have undergone repeated IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspections that confirmed the absence of nuclear weapons in Iran on several occasions.
During a visit to Pakistan, Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Nateq Nuri denies Western media reports that he held talks with Pakistani officials concerning cooperation between Iran and Pakistan in the field of nuclear technology. Some US officials have claimed that Iran is trying to purchase weapons technology from Pakistan.
During an interview in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, Iran's Defense Minister, says Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear technologies will help counter the threat of Israel, but states that Iran does not wish to see an arms race in the region. Shamkhani states, "Logic says that Iran is always against any kind of arms race, especially a nuclear one. We believe that this trend entails danger and damage, including economic damage, and will not achieve the cherished security. We do not support any endeavor to acquire nuclear weapons."
During his fourth visit to Iran in less than two years, British Foreign Minister Jack Straw calls on the Iranian government to sign the NPT additional protocol "unconditionally" and warned that Iranian-English relations may suffer if it does not. Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi bluntly replied in the same press conference that Iran will not make any concessions on the additional protocol until the international community made some concessions toward Iran.
During his visit to Tehran, Hans Blix, the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says that Iran has not violated any of its nuclear safeguards commitments. The IAEA, at Tehran's request, is helping improve Iran's nuclear fuel safety procedures. Blix says that Iranian President Rafsanjani responded positively to a suggestion that Iran sign the strengthened safeguards agreement [the so-called Additional Protocol]. According to Blix, Rafsanjani also confirmed "that the agency is welcome to go to any place any time [it] wanted in Iran" to inspect its nuclear facilities. Blix and Rafsanjani also discuss the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East. [Note: See 1 June 2000 and 31 May 2002.]
During Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's state visit to India; Indian officials say that a 1975 India-Iran agreement lays the groundwork for future nuclear cooperation between the countries, although India recently gave in to US pressure and refused to sell Iran a nuclear reactor.
During meetings with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeniy Primakov and senior Russian officials, US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott expresses US concerns that Iran may update missile and nuclear programs because of increased cooperation between Russia and Iran. The United States believes that Russian firms are passing sensitive technologies to Iran and is concerned about the Russian participation in the construction of a nuclear power plant in Bushehr. First Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Maslykov says that the allegations are unsubstantiated and that Talbott does not have specific examples of such activity.
During meetings with the US Congress, the Mojahedin-e Khalq, an Iranian opposition group, accuses the Iranian government of trying to buy or develop nuclear weapons with the help of China. Both Iran and China deny the allegation. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also denies reports that Iran sent emissaries to Beijing to purchase Chinese nuclear weapons technology. On 7 October the Mojahedin says that an Iranian delegation of scientists traveled to China and North Korea to discuss "expanding deliveries of nuclear and ballistic missile technologies." [Note: The Mohajedin-e Khlaq is known to make exaggerated claims about the Iranian government and its nuclear program.]
During talks with Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani, Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng agrees to provide expertise and technology to complete nuclear reactors begun by France and Germany, according to sources in Iran's government. Iran announces that China will assist in rebuilding the Bushehr reactor but continues negotiations with Germany's Siemens. [Note: See October 1991, 31 October 1991, 19 September 1994, and 29 September 1994 for additional information on China's role in the construction of Bushehr.]
During talks with Yevgeniy Adamov, Russian's Minister of Nuclear Energy, former Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, head of Iran's Expediency Council, stresses the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program, affirming "any country is legally entitled to engage in peaceful development of the atom and no country has the right to put obstacles in the way of the economic development of independent states."
A report by Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the Russian Federation Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission for Ecological Safety, quotes the additional protocol to the Iran-Russia nuclear contract of January 1995, showing that the two sides had in fact discussed the sale of a centrifuge plant for uranium enrichment and called for the signing of a contract within six months for the construction of a uranium silo. The protocol, signed by the heads of Iran's and Russia's atomic energy agencies, Reza Amrollahi and Viktor Mikhailov, also calls for a contract to be signed in the first quarter of 1995 for the delivery of 2,000 tons of natural uranium. [Note: The protocol contradicts Amrollahi's previous statement that Iran never sought a centrifuge. See 11 May 1995. Also, the uranium silos are probably the silos whose sale Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed to cancel on 11 May 1995 because they represent a military aspect of the nuclear deal.] Yablokov also asserts that the Russia nuclear deal violates the 1992 framework agreement with Iran (Decree No. 592 of 17 August 1992), because that agreement called for the supply to Iran of two medium reactors VVER-440 [440MW], not the 1000MW VVER-1000 reactors.
During the presentation of the latest IAEA report on the implementation in Iran of the NPT safeguards agreement, Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, states that "the report points out that Iran has failed to report certain nuclear material and activities and that cooperative actions being taken in cooperation with Iranian authorities."
Eberhard Posner, head of corporate communications for Germany's Siemens, in a letter to The New York Times, refutes speculation that his company is "somehow involved in Iran's attempts to acquire nuclear technology." Posner says, "Siemens has no joint venture with Skoda Plzen in nuclear technology. We have no activities whatever to enable third parties to advance nuclear technology in Iran." He concludes that Siemens "has no plans to complete Bushehrwith Skoda or anyone else."
Eduard Akopyan, director of the Russian Industrial Association Zarubedzatomenergostroy, an organization that builds nuclear power plants abroad, says "Russia's accords with all partners, with Iran and China; in particular, on the delivery of light water VVER nuclear reactors remain in effect."
Eduard Akopyan, head of the Zarubezhatomenergostroy company for nuclear power engineering abroad, says that "all contracts will Iran are exclusively peaceful and do not differ from dozens of contracts with other states."
Eduard Akopyan, the director of the All-Russian Industrial Association Zarubezhatomenergostroy (company for nuclear power engineering abroad), states that Russia will provide Iran with the results of an assessment of the incomplete Bushehr nuclear station and construction designs of Unit 1. In October 1995, a $800 million contract for the completion of the first 1,000MW reactor will officially enter into force. Russia will have 55 months to complete the construction of Unit 1. Spent fuel from the reactor will be returned to Russia for reprocessing, with the vitrified waste returned to Iran. If the project is successful, the contract will be extended to include the completion of Bushehr-2. [Note: This may conform with a 7 September 1995 statement by a Russian official that a second and third reactor will be built at Bushehr only after the completion of the first reactor. Also, on 24 August 1994, Viktor Mikhailov, Russian minister of atomic energy, said the amended Iranian-Russian nuclear contract may call for the eventual construction of up to four reactors.] Due to seismological instability, Russia and Iran decided to relocate to Bushehr two VVER-440 [440MW light water] nuclear reactors originally planned for a site in northern Iran. He adds that Russia has not signed a secret contract for military nuclear cooperation with Iran and all contracts are for strict peaceful use and that they are all under strict IAEA control.
Efraim Halevy, the head of the Israeli intelligence organization Mossad, says that Iran is developing nuclear and other non-conventional weapons.
Efraim Sneh, a member of Israel's Labor Knesset and the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, espouses a strategy against Iran that calls for a pre-emptive strike against Iran. This action, Sneh asserts, "aims to prevent Iran from having nuclear capability. That must not happen. Twenty-five years after the Yom Kippur War, the Iranians must not have a nuclear bomb because they already have the means to launch it at the heart of the State of Israel."
Efraim Sneh, Israeli minister of transportation calls for sanctions against Iran so it will not have money to build nuclear arms. "The most important and maybe the most urgent thing," he says, "is to urge the Russian to stop the technological assistance, and especially for the Iranian nuclear project."
Efrayim Sne, Israeli Knesset member, says diplomatic efforts to halt Iran's development of nonconventional arms have thus far failed. Asserting Iran views Israel as its "main ideological rival," Sne believes Iran's nuclear development will likely produce a Shehab-3 missile capable of striking Israel within 18 months.
Egyptian sources say the basis of the 1995 Israeli-Turkish military cooperation agreement may be plans for an air strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, allowing Israel access to Turkish air bases from which "any Iranian target" is reachable.
A report by Denmark's Armed Forces Intelligence Service says Russia constitutes a serious threat to Middle East stability. Specifically, the report discusses Russia's close ties to Iran as being "private, profit-oriented, foreign policy," that have been established to develop a trade of weapons technology and technology for developing nuclear power, which "in a number of cases are [sic] in direct violation of international conventions."
Ehud Barak, chairman of Israel's Labor Party, says Russia's increasing influence on Iran's alleged unconventional weapons development represents a danger to the world.
Ehud Barak, the Israeli foreign minister, praises US efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities and adds that Iran remains a threat to regional stability.
El Independent of Madrid reports that 2,000 workers, plus 200 scientists, are or were working on Iran's nuclear research.
ElBaradei expresses the opinion that it is unwise to take Iran to the Security Council, as "you run the risk that Iran might opt out of the NPT and you have another North Korea" and that it was a good idea therefore to give diplomacy a chance in the absence of a "smoking gun."
